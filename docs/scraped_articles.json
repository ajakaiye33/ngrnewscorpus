          "title": "Withdraw order on reporting of terrorist attacks within 24hrs or\u2026, SERAP tells FG",
          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently instruct Minister of Information and Culture, Mr Lai Mohammed, and the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, to withdraw within 24 hours the directive containing a sweeping gag order banning journalists and broadcast stations from reporting details of terrorist attacks and victims across the country.\n\nRecall that NBC had in a letter dated 7 July. 7, 2021 issued a directive asking journalists, television, and radio stations in Nigeria to stop \u201cglamourising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nNBC called for \u2018caution\u2019 by broadcasters while reporting security challenges in the country. The directive, titled: \u2018Newspaper Reviews And Current Affairs Programmes: A Need For Caution\u2019, was signed by the Director, Broadcast Monitoring, Francisca Aiyetan, on behalf of the new Director-General of the Commission, Balarabe Ilelah.\n\nReacting, SERAP in a letter dated July 17, 2021 by its deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, said: \u201cThe contents of the directive by the NBC to journalists and broadcast stations are entirely inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cWe would be grateful if the repressive directive is withdrawn within 24 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe organization expressed \u201cgrave concern that the contents of the NBC directive would impermissibly restrict the rights to freedom of expression, information, and victims\u2019 right to justice and effective remedies that are central to public debate and accountability in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cReporting on the growing violence and killings in many parts of the country is a matter of public interest. The NBC directive to journalists and broadcast stations to stop reporting these cases, coupled with the possibility of fines and other punishment, would have a disproportionate chilling effect on the work of those seeking to hold the government accountable to the public.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe broad definitions of what may constitute \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourising\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 heighten concerns of overreach, confer far-reaching discretion on the government, and suggest that the NBC directive is more intrusive than necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese words and phrases do not indicate precisely what kind of individual conduct would fall within their ambit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vague and overbroad definitions of \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourising\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 also raise concern that the NBC directive unduly interferes with the rights to freedom of expression and information, and is disproportionate to any purported legitimate governmental aim. Ill-defined and/or overly broad directives are open to arbitrary application and abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe use of these words and phrases by the NBC, given their opaque and ambiguous meaning, leaves open the possibility for application beyond unequivocal incitement to hatred, hostility or violence. Such words and phrases may function to interpret legitimate reporting by broadcast stations, journalists, and other Nigerians as unlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cExacerbating these concerns are growing restriction of civic space, the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and the attempts by your government to push for the amendment of the Nigeria Press Council Act and the National Broadcasting Commission Act, to further suppress media freedom, freedom of expression and access to information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing the media to freely carry out their duties is essential to building a secure society and leaving no one behind. Conversely, imposing impermissible restrictions on broadcast stations, journalists and other Nigerians undermine the security that builds a healthy and vibrant society.\u201d\n\n\u201cArticle 19(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights establishes the right to freedom of opinion without interference. Article 19(2) establishes Nigeria\u2019s obligations to respect and ensure this right, which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and through any media of one\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder article 19(3), restrictions on the right to freedom of expression must be \u2018provided by law\u2019, and necessary \u2018for respect of the rights or reputations of others or \u2018for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health and morals\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough article 19(3) recognizes \u2018national security as a legitimate aim, the Human Rights Council, the body charged with monitoring implementation of the Covenant, has stressed \u2018the need to ensure that invocation of national security is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSince article 19(2) promotes so clearly a right to information of all kinds, this indicates that your government bears the burden of justifying any restriction on reporting of cases of violence and killings, and withholding of such information as an exception to that right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny restrictions should be applied strictly so that they do not put in jeopardy the right itself. The NBC directive to broadcast stations fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe requirement of necessity also implies an assessment of the proportionality of restrictions such as those being imposed by the NBC, with the aim of ensuring that restrictions target a specific objective and do not unduly intrude upon the rights of targeted persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interference with the constitutional and legal duties of journalists and broadcast stations cannot be justified in the context of the right to information, as the NBC directive has not shown that their reporting would impose a specific risk of harm to a legitimate State interest that outweighs the public\u2019s interest in such information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NBC directive may also create an environment that unduly deters and penalizes broadcast stations and journalists, and the reporting of government wrongdoing more generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom expression has concluded that national security considerations should be \u2018limited in application to situations in which the interest of the whole nation is at stake, which would thereby exclude restrictions in the sole interest of a government, regime, or power group.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP notes the collective interdependency of the compendium of constitutional and international human rights, which function to collectively complement and enhance the advancement of the security and rights of each individual in society.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that the aspects highlighted will help guide your actions in acting to ensure that Nigerian journalists and media can freely carry out their constitutional duties as contained in Section 22 of the Nigerian Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile your government has the obligation to maintain national security, this obligation is not set apart from the obligation to protect and ensure human rights. National security is a necessary and integral part of the right to security guaranteed to each person individually.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a major illicit drug kingpin in Anambra, Okeke Chijioke.\n\nThe agency said its operatives recovered 548,000 tablets of Tramadol branded as Tarkadol from the 44-year old\u2019s warehouse at 3 Atunya street, Maryland Estate, Nkwelle in Oyi local government area.\n\nDuring the search on the warehouse, a double barrel pump gun and three live cartridges, were also recovered.\n\nDirector, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, Femi Babafemi, revealed these in a statement on Sunday.\n\nBabafemi said Okeke\u2019s arrest on Saturday, July 10, 2021, followed credible intelligence and surveillance, which confirmed he stocked his warehouse with the illicit drug.\n\nThe agency\u2019s spokesman said the suspect accepted ownership of the drugs.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cPreliminary investigation has established that Tarkadol is a brand of Tramadol that has just been introduced into the market to evade attention. The substance has also tested positive to amphetamine.\n\n\u201cThe drug was equally labeled 100mg pain reliever on its packs to avoid scrutiny, while laboratory tests confirmed it\u2019s a 225mg drug. It was further discovered that the drug was manufactured in India and smuggled into Nigeria without NAFDAC number or certification. During the search on the warehouse, a double-barrel pump gun with 3 live cartridges, which licence expired in 2019, was also discovered and recovered.\n\n\u201cThis is even as operatives of the Benue state command of the Agency on road patrol in Apir village on 14th July intercepted and seized 28,400 capsules of Tramadol from one Dankawu Madaki, who hails from Misah LG, Bauchi state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn a related development, a notorious interstate drug dealer, Godiya Linus, based in Taraba but supplies narcotics to dealers in Adamawa has been arrested in Numan area of the state. Godiya, an ex-convict, was in jail between 2012 and 2018 following his conviction on drug related charges.\n\n\u201cA drug dealer, Mohammed Ali had earlier been arrested on 10th July with 1.150kg of diazepam in Numan. A follow-up operation led to the arrest of Godiya who supplied Ali, while investigation has since revealed that he\u2019s based in Mayolope village in Lau local government area of Taraba, from where he supplies Jambutu park in Yola and other parts of Numan, using an unregistered boxer motorcycle for distribution.\n\n\u201cFew days after Godiya\u2019s arrest, another dealer, Emmanuel Ishiwu was nabbed with different quantities of Tramadol, Exol-5 and Diazepam, totalling 6.103kg also in Numan on 14th July, followed by the arrest of Muhammadu Garba and Shaibu Haruna with 48.500kg of cannabis in Gurin area of the state on Friday, 16th July 2021.\n\n\u201cCommending the officers and men of the Anambra, Benue and Adamawa state Commands for sustaining the offensive action in the ongoing efforts to mop up illicit drugs from every community in all parts of Nigeria, Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) charged them to remain unrelenting in the discharge of their duties.\u201d",

          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nBig Brother Naija star, Mercy Eke, has continued to shine as a sought-after brand ambassador after winning the BBNaija Reality Show (Pepper Them edition) in 2019.\n\nIn a recent chat with Sunday Sun at Mega Plaza, Victoria Island, she stated why she turned down some brand offers.\n\nShe also opened up on her new ambition to empower young girls who have genuine business ideas, but lacked the financial capacity to start up, how to complete her Lambo Homes, and M&M clothing line.\n\nFollowing your activities since 2019 when you won the BBNaija reality show, how has life been?\n\nI thank God for all these. Life has not been easy, but also easy at the same time. I would not thread this jackpot lifestyle for anything. God has been great. I have been working hard, working on myself. I have also been trying to work on the stereotype of being forgotten after one year. That is putting me on my toe that I have to do extra things to remain very relevant in the industry. I just need to work extra hard to keep the tempo going. I am not taking anything for granted. I have had my worst times in this journey, but I give God all the glory.\n\nWhat sort of bad moments did you have?\n\nBad moments could come in form of health challenges, family, relationship and mental crisis. These could be bad moments for someone. Most times, it is also for us to know that money cannot guarantee happiness. When I say, I had my worst times, don\u2019t forget I am also human, I would have had a fair share of my personal challenges.\n\nAs a sought-after brand ambassador, have you rejected any endorsement since you came out of the House?\n\nYes, I have rejected a few brands. Some who would want to sign me on, but not willing to come to terms with my conditions. I like brands that do not want conflicts and work with all the ambassadors. Since brands pay millions to take their products to the next level, I have a responsibility to bring value to such works, but when someone likes to trade off conflicts, I do not like such. If brands do not agree to my terms, I might not work with them because I really want my peace as you can see that I am a work in progress. I would not want to work where peaceful atmosphere does not exist. I would not like to come to a shoot where people are all frowning, and that creates a bitter aura among the people who should collaborate. I would not want to be labeled a difficult ambassador to work with; so, if I see that from the onset, I might turn the offer down. But recently, Payporte unveiled me as their brand ambassador because we agreed on terms and conditions and I promise to represent them well. I dropped a lot of brands that could not meet up with my terms.\n\nApart from the millions you are paid as a brand ambassador, what are the other attractions?\n\nNow, Payporte which is my latest offer is a big fashion brand, I went to their page and love what they deal with, I buy from them a lot even before we started the ambassadorial journey. When the offer came two years ago, I had my background check and felt it is what I can relate with. I like to work with such brands because they have a lot of beautiful and affordable outfits for all. Their brand relates with mine and we agreed on certain visions that we can work together on and that is it.\n\nSo, what new thing do you bring to the table when you are signed on?\n\nThe partnership is what I normally take to the next level. I like bringing values to the brands I work with. I am shooting a season two reality show that will go worldwide with time. It will air on African Magic 198.\n\nIs the reality show personal or is it for Payporte?\n\nI am shooting the Season 2 of Mercy Ekeh reality show which centres on my lifestyle, how I live, the things I do, the brands I work with. A reality show that is about my life, Mercy Eke, what next?\n\nIs it a show modelling around Oprah Winfrey show?\n\nIt is a personal show that centres around me, myself and I alone, just like the Kardashian show?\n\nWhat about your romantic life?\n\nRight now, I am single, but not searching.\n\nTake us into your lifestyle, who was Mercy Ekeh, where are you coming from?\n\nMercy Ekeh was born and raised in Owerri, Imo State. We lived as a family especially with my mum and sisters. All my schooling was in Owerri, Imo State. I graduated from Imo State University where I studied Psychology.\n\nAs a fashion brand ambassador, tell us about the things you like to wear?\n\nMy style in fashion is comfort, and not the price. The outfit on me today is from Payporte, which is comfortable, classy, sexy and beautiful. I love confidence in my style, it does not matter what brand I wore, it must be comfortable. Again, being sexy in what one is wearing is what fashion means to me.\n\nWhat about our Nigerian designers, how would you access them?\n\nI wear a lot of Nigerian brands when I attend events; they amaze me a lot; but I am here today for another business.\n\nDo you regret your love in the house?\n\nNo, I do not regret my love with my ex-boyfriend. Love is a beautiful thing and that was a beautiful experience for me. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but life will always move on.\n\nWhat did you do with the lockdown last year during COVID-19?\n\nIt was really hard, because I was indoors likewise everyone. I created content at the comfort of my home and put it out there. I was at home too working with the brands on social media.\n\nNengi is also a brand ambassador of Payporte, some people claim that both of you are not friends; how true is that and how do you intend to work with her?\n\nWell, like we discussed this morning, we are having a photo shoot in Paris together. If we are not together, how would such hold? Most times, the social media create these stuffs.\n\nTalk about the memorable times for you in Big Brother House?\n\nI liked the tasks I got involved with, relationships, and the amazing people I met in the house that up till today we have built it into another bigger family. Some people came to the house for the fame, some came to do things to better our lives.\n\nWhat drives you because you are multi-talented. Actress, model and entrepreneur?\n\nWhat drives me is the hunger to help my family, people around me and be independent as a woman.\n\nNow that you are here, are you in touch with the home to encourage much younger girls to be where you are today?\n\nI just launched my Mercy Eke Foundation here in Lagos. I want to give out N5 million to young girl-entrepreneurs. It is basically for young girls who have genuine business idea, but do not have the money to facilitate their dreams. That will be my own contribution in my own little way.\n\nWhere would you want to be in the next five-10 years?\n\nMaybe in my husband\u2019s house\u2026(Laughter). I want to have my real estate business \u2018Lambo Homes\u2019 completed. My fashion brand, M&M Luxury, which is a fashion brand that everyone can afford to be up there. My brand is all about making women beautiful. One does not need to break the bank before she looks good.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

In Nigeria right from time immemorial, lands belong to individuals and families. But in 1976, immediately after the Biafra-Nigeria civil war, the military government of Nigeria promulgated the Decree of 1976 which invested all lands in Nigeria to the state governors.\n\n\u201cThere are 36 states in Nigeria and the federal capital territory, Abuja. So, all the 36 governors are owners of the lands in Nigeria and the Federal Government owns the capital territory, Abuja. But the Federal Government does not respect this Decree of 1976.\n\n\u201cJust recently, the 17 Southern governors came together and banned open grazing in the entire Southern region, the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari nullified the action of the 17 Southern governors and said that there was a grazing route that must be established to enable the armed Fulani herdsmen to come to our lands in the South to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cThis grazing route is against the provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria because it is not contained in the 1999 Constitution as amended. But because of his position as the president of Nigeria and a Hausa/Fulani man, he wants to enforce it against our will.\n\n\u201cIn Biafra land, which is in the Southern Nigeria, our lands are blessed with crude oil deposits, and fertile. Because of the fertility of our lands, the Fulani forced themselves into our lands to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the atrocities we are having today in Nigeria emanated from the Land Use Act of 1976.\n\nBecause these people came to our land to commit all these atrocities because they have the protection of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUwazuruike pointed out that the Nigeria-Biafra war was as a result of the injustices perpetrated against the people of Biafra.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why it is very essential that Biafra must be given recognition by the United Nations. Because if Biafra is not given recognition as a sovereign state, these atrocities will not stop because our land is rich with mineral resources as against the North that is a desert area,\u201d he claimed.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "For The Records: Igbo still surrounded by lingering pain of defeat \u2013Bianca Ojukwu",
          "text": "Being the text of a paper delivered by Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu Ojukwu on the occasion of the International Research Conference on 50 years post-Nigeria civil war on July 6, 2021 at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Anambra State.\n\nThe Nigeria/Biafra war ended on January 15, 1970 and Biafra was re-integrated into the Nigeria polity with the official policy of \u2018No victor, No vanquished\u2019 with the planned implementation of the three Rs: Reconciliation, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.\n\nThe essence of this discourse is to delve into the rudiments and practical applications of this policy, as well as interventions that were propagated as formulas for healing the wounds created by the war, but in effect exposed the complexities and hypocrisy of policy formulations which have consistently failed to deal successfully with the intricacies and challenges of the post conflict scenario. It is also my intention to undertake a cursory analysis of these initiatives in order to determine to what extent each policy has achieved the desired success in addressing the critical national issues of integration and reconciliation.\n\nWhat has become glaringly obvious is that the much touted three Rs, far from being agents of re-integration ended up as a cover under which the Igbo, with other southern minorities that comprised the breakaway Republic of Biafra, right after the war were subjected to unimaginable punitive monetary measures with the payment of a paltry twenty pounds to Igbo depositors irrespective of whatever amount of money they had saved in the banks; a veiled process by which they were subjected to the harshest set of realities starting with the predicaments of Biafran soldiers and Ex-servicemen who were rendered destitute at the end of that war, to the calculated economic emasculation of the Igbos who were to all intents and purposes excluded from the formal economic sector by the Indigenization Decree whilst reeling from the abandoned property saga.\n\nLittle wonder, then that the late legal luminary and human rights icon, Chief Gani Fawehinmi in an interview published in the News Magazine of August 10, 1998 was prompted to state that\u2026\n\n\u2018the Igbo still bear the scars of the Biafran crisis, and they are still being treated as if the war is still nascent; which is wrong. They have been kept out of security forces of this country at strategic levels. I don\u2019t know how many senior police officers are Igbo, and the Army \u2026 it is not fair if you want to establish one country, to marginalize a majority of that magnitude and importance and innovative leadership\u2019.\n\nThe manifest challenges of a genuine re-integration of the Igbo into mainstream Nigeria and the lip service approach to the Gen. Yakubu Gowon post war pronouncement of \u2018No Victor and no Vanquished\u2019 compelled Gen. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Biafra\u2019s wartime leader, in his welcome address to the members of the National Reconciliation Committee at a summit held in Enugu on March 13, 1997 to declare that,\n\n\u2018The conduct of the war and the manner of its end were no less enlightened. How could a people already inundated with superior arms and endless supplies call for hunger as an (additional) instrument of war against their brothers and sisters? How could one imagine, how much less implement, a policy depriving every Igbo man of his life-long savings and money \u2013 leveling everyone far below a poverty line of twenty pounds each, regardless of their wealth? How could a people turn around to evolve a certain indigenization policy intended to make some people buy over the economy after ensuring that their brothers and sisters had no kobo to participate in doing so? How could you march forward and deprive a section of its properties \u2013 their only remaining source of sustenance \u2013 merely by unilaterally labeling the property abandoned? Abandoned in a foreign land, Jack? We are yet to touch the cases of Igbos who after rendering meritorious services in the Armed Forces and the police, as well as the civil service, were rendered non-persons by both official and unofficial policies of those in power. These do not include a multitude of decrees, edicts, court rulings, infrastructural policies, administrative measures, socio-cultural schemes, and other countless designs intended to achieve the same objective of impoverishing, humiliating, and marginalizing a whole race. No one remembered that these Igbos were the same that played and would continue to play a pivotal role in Nigerian politics, in its economic construction and development, and its unity. All the above were in the context of a certain policy called \u201cRehabilitation, Reconciliation, and Reconstruction\u201d in whatever order. The only sense in which we can value rehabilitation is when the Igbos are fully rehabilitated into full Nigerian citizens. Instead of any of the above policies and practices abating, they have found expression in some other ways \u2026in quota school admissions, capricious designation of educationally disadvantaged states, haphazard application of federal character, whimsical boundary adjustments, provocative promotions in the services and so on and so forth, none of which \u2013 as bad as the policy and concept are \u2013 mean what it says, and all of which are carefully crafted and targeted mainly against a section of the Nigerian population, NDIGBO. These are all central issues of justice, democracy and human rights which some of our compatriots in Nigeria would either enjoy violating or watch being violated, of course, to the detriment of Ndigbo\u2019\n\nIt remains an incontrovertible fact that the Federal Government of Nigeria has confronted grave difficulties in her efforts to work out a workable engagement between the nationalities- most especially the Igbo within its union, and the nation-state to which they are said to belong, so many decades after the war. How could a government which never deemed it necessary to institute any mechanism or platform for reconciliatory justice in the mould of a truth and justice commission to address the war atrocities be said to be sincerely committed to reconciling its ethnicities? The major considerations in the aftermath of the war should not just have focused on the issue of who would control political power at the center but more importantly, how that political power would be shared in such a way that the states, which are the federating units can act as a moderating influence on the center as the case should be, in a true federation; greater attention should also have been given to how the interests of the various nationalities could be balanced in such a way as to guarantee equality, freedom and equity for all its citizens, and most prominently, how to engender in every Nigerian, that national consciousness which would make him not only proud to be identified as a Nigerian, but also to give that citizen a stake in the nation, such that he or she would be prepared to die for it.\n\nEven the Guardian of London at the end of that war stated that \u2018Nigeria\u2019s independence has so far been vitiated by the chronic power struggles of its three major tribes. Nigerians now want to ensure that a workable balance of power is struck between the states and the center, and above all, that no one group dominates the center. The federal victory has not remade Nigeria\u2026 it has only provided a chance to do so\u2019.\n\nTo what extent successive federal governments have been able to utilize this opportunity effectively remains a matter of debate. Some of the initiatives that have been put in place to assuage the competition (and to what extent they may be considered positive or adverse) among the various nationalities- for wealth, political power, political positions, social services, education, allocation of resources, the composition and control of the Armed Forces and the police, the bureaucracy and the corporations, will be briefly highlighted here, with special emphasis on the Igbo experience of the practical application of such policies.\n\nThe Nigeria/Biafra war most commonly referred to as the Civil War (although I am quite sure that most people here today will agree with me, that there is absolutely nothing that is civil about any war, let alone a war between \u2018brothers\u2019) has taught us that whatever happens to, or in the Armed Forces of Nigeria can affect the peace and stability in the country. Did it not become inexorable that Nigeria would be subjugated to military rule midway into its First Republic which in turn would result in a civil war, and would subsequently be subjected, even post war, to a series of military and ex-military rulers?\n\nFollowing the secession of Biafra in 1967, the Nigerian government had ordered all its officers and men who were training at facilities all over the world to return home for the war. They were instructed to return to their bases in their respective regions. Most of these officers and men who returned to their bases which fell under the Biafran areas were compelled to join the Biafran side. At the end of the war, however, the reintegration policy of the Federal Government after amnesty was granted to ex-Biafran soldiers, was limited in its application and many Nigerian officers and men of South Eastern extraction who fought on the side of Biafra discovered that their names were either removed from the list of officers and men of the Nigerian Army, Navy or Air Force as the case may be or that they were not entitled to either pension or gratuities.\n\nFurthermore, in the same process of reintegrating ex-Biafran soldiers into the Nigerian military, a board of officers was set up to investigate the war activities and roles of officers on the secessionist side. When this exercise was concluded, the Adebayo Commission recommended that combatant officers above the rank of Captain were either to be dismissed, discharged or retired without benefits and only Lieutenants and junior officers were to be re-absorbed. Even at that these officers were to face challenges in terms of benefits and promotion. This decision was so craftly implemented to neutralize an entire generation of Igbo officers and edge out the Igbo from ever rising within the Army. It took forty years after the Biafra war for an Igbo man, Lieutenant General Azubuike Ihejirika to be appointed the Chief of Army Staff, under the President Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2010. In view of the foregoing, to what effect, then, was General Gowon\u2019s post war speech of reintegration when considered in basic human terms? Moreover, over five thousand police officers who fought on the Biafra side were granted general amnesty only in 2003 by President Olusegun Obasanjo but had to wait till 2007 to receive their entitlements, a whole 37 years after the end of the war.\n\nFifty years on, the Igbo remain structurally disadvantaged in the Nigeria Armed Forces as well as inadequately represented. As at today no Igbo is a serving Service Chief in the Armed Forces and surviving ex-Biafran soldiers have continued to ask for genuine reintegration and assimilation into the nation\u2019s Armed Forces, if only to facilitate the payment of their pensions.\n\nSince the end of the Nigeria/Biafra war there have been an assortment of government programs or policies designed essentially to promote, as has been claimed, the integration and reintegration of the various ethnic nationalities. I have briefly discussed the federal military government\u2019s own notion of reintegration as was applied to officers and men of the Biafra Armed Forces. It was anything but equitable.\n\nOne of the better known initiatives set out by the Federal Government after the Biafra war aimed at reintegrating citizens and reuniting the country is the National Youth Service Corps program (NYSC) which came into existence by decree number 24 of 22nd May 1973. The program is a mandatory one-year service to the country after completion of a first degree for youth under 30 years of age, participation being a pre-requisite for employment and holding public office in Nigeria. The scheme is designed to aid social integration by deploying youths to states outside their states of origin or primary residence to unfamiliar locations on assignment to work in areas or fields relevant to their academic pursuit. It was projected that this exercise will provide youth with an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions which would in turn help to reduce inter-ethnic stereotypes, as well as suspicion and distrust which were prevalent among the various ethnic groups after the war. It was also anticipated that the exercise would inculcate a strong sense of patriotism among Nigeria youth and enhance the levels of social tolerance required to dismantle cultural barriers and fuel harmonious relationships, even promoting inter-tribal marriages.\n\nWhether this program has achieved its lofty objectives in terms of integration of ethnic groupings or not, has been subject to controversy. The commission itself continues to be plagued by mismanagement, corruption, and most significantly, the inability to guarantee the security of the lives of the corpers themselves in their location of service. There have been numerous tragic incidents where corpers have been caught up in sectarian conflicts or killed just simply for belonging to a different ethnic group and in post-election violence. A case in point occurred during the 2011 general elections where many corps members of southern descent were butchered by some irate northern youths. With the prevailing security situation in the country caused by Boko Haram, rampaging herdsmen and the scourge of the unknown gunmen, and with serial reprisal attacks it goes without saying that intending youth corpers are no longer at ease with engaging in service in crisis-prone areas. It is also given that youths of Igbo extraction would consider their lives at greater risk if deployed for service in certain states of North eastern Nigeria and also vice versa in the case of northern youths who are deployed for service in South eastern states. This places a question mark on the issue whether this initiative can justifiably be considered a veritable tool of integration in today\u2019s Nigeria. There have also been accusations of ethnic bias as well as favouritism in the posting of corps members. The reality is that many of these corpers, after concluding national service have been routinely denied employment in their states of assignment and invariably end up being discriminated against and tagged as \u201cnon-indigenes\u201d. More often than not they are forced to return to their states of origin for employment. It would appear, then, that the scheme is yet far from the realization of its goal of fostering national integration and this has led to recent calls to scrap the program.\n\nAnother much publicized initiative of integration is the federal character principle. This principle was outlined in the 1979 Constitution and was conceived to tackle the problem facing the practice of true federalism, taking into cognizance the diverse and plural nature of the Nigerian society. It was equally projected to address what has been described as the \u201cparochialism of ignorance\u201d which breeds distrust and suspicion among the various ethnic groups in Nigeria. The federal character principle, it was claimed, \u2018would promote unity, peace, equal access to state resources whilst also accommodating the diverse ethnic, religious and geographic groups in the economic, socio-cultural and decision-making apparatus of the state, with special consideration for less advantaged states for overall improvement in the lives of the citizenry\u2019. In practice, however, this initiative has ended up eclipsing meritocracy and introducing patent mediocrity, cronyism, nepotism and corruption into the Nigerian bureaucracy and public service and by extension perpetuating the ethnic bias it was intended to combat.\n\nThe federal character commission, it would seem, has invariably capitulated to the seemingly intractable malaise which affects public institutions in Nigeria today, employing levels of favouritism and nepotism which seem blatantly to ignore Nigeria\u2019s cultural, ethnic and religious diversities as well as its historic sensitivities. The Igbos as well as other ethnic minorities within the defunct Biafra enclave have been subjected to decades of official discrimination with the proverbial glass ceiling which continues to hover their heads in most facets of their existence within the Nigerian nation. The federal character principle today continues to be jettisoned in the appointment of Service Chiefs, judges, heads of ministries and parastatals, federal boards and other government agencies. Igbos have also not fared better as regards their share in federal infrastructure, industries and the like. From the foregoing it can also be deduced that the federal character principle has not been fully utilized as a policy of integration most particularly as a policy to address the injustices of the indigenization decree.\n\nThe quota system is yet another initiative for integration. The introduction of this model for admission into the Nigerian educational sector came about in 1975 during the military regime of General Murtala Mohammed. It was borne out of a need to ensure that those areas of Nigeria considered as being educationally disadvantaged are assisted to achieve similar socio-economic development as their counterparts in other parts of the country through education. It was also promoted as an initiative that would pacify violent agitations, and ensure that various disuniting forces like the perceived lopsided educational advancement which seemed to have placed some regions of Nigeria at vantage position for socio-economic development and which could continue to propel the fear of domination of one ethnic group over another are arrested. The reality, however, is that 45 years after the introduction of this system in the country\u2019s educational sector the same problems continue to linger. As a result, other ethnic groups which are non-beneficiaries of the quota system of admission now have cause to question the justification for the continued implementation of this system. The system was designed to address disparities in educational attainments of different sections of the country in order to ensure that a certain number of candidates from each state of the country are admitted into schools in each academic year. Admissions were based not on merit, but state of origin considerations supposedly to ensure a balanced representation of the various states of the federation in the distribution of opportunities. The admission guidelines in unity secondary schools and tertiary institutions prescribed certain cutoff marks state to state. However, the quota system rather than being an instrument of national integration has become the very opposite, with its implementation constituting a continual violation of the principle of equal rights. The provision of adequate educational opportunities for every citizen at all levels devoid of ethnic considerations as provided for in Section 18 (1) and Section 42 (1) of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria continues to be breached under this policy. It is certainly improper for any policy of the government like the quota system to be seen to violate the constitutional rights of some of its citizens on account of their state of origin. As such this policy cannot be seen as a viable option for promoting sustainable national integration. Rather, it portrays the sad reality of a government\u2019s methodical violation of the constitutional rights of some of its own citizens while conversely upholding those of others and indirectly encouraging social discrimination of one group against the other. How does one justify, for example, the admission guideline as currently implemented in unity secondary school which prescribes cutoff marks in Anambra State to be 139, Ogun State is 131 while Bauchi State is 35, Yobe State is 2 for the male, 27 for the female and Zamfara State is 4 for the male and 2 for the female? It then follows that any situation wherein over 70% of Nigerians who apply for admission into schools every year are denied admission opportunities not because they are not qualified but because certain factors like their state of origin as prescribed by the quota system militate against their prospects of admission cannot be said to promote integration and national unity. More pointedly, utilizing the collective resources of a country to run educational institution only to turn around and deny some qualified applicants of admission opportunities into schools on the bases of state of origin cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be perceived as a uniting exercise. The quota system has continued to provoke deep resentment on the part of many Nigerians, particularly those from areas of the country that have been labeled as educationally advantaged such as states within the Southeast and Southwest of Nigeria. At present, Anambra State in South Eastern Nigeria has the highest cut off mark within the Quota System in the whole federation. Citizens in the adversely affected regions remain convinced that the quota system of admission as a policy is designed purely as an instrument of marginalization and subjugation. What has become patently clear is that rather than enhancing national integration, the quota system continues to pose a grave threat to the sustainability of the unity of this country as sectional resentments continue to fester, most especially among the youth.\n\nNigeria continues to be plagued by political, religious, and socio-cultural dichotomies, and this is hardly surprising in view of the complex issues bedeviling the country, issues of self-indulgent political leadership, corruption, weak institutions and most significantly, the use of ethnic and religious differences as a means of solidifying political solidarity by competing power blocs. The resurgence of separatist groups like the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) in the Southeast, other separatist groups in the Southwest and South-south, as well as the Boko Haram crisis have fueled the spate of protests which have turned violent in recent times further escalating the state of insecurity and tension in the country. This remains a serious indictment on the various reintegration policies embarked upon by successive Federal Governments and continues to cast a spotlight on the deteriorating material conditions of the people of the Southeast and the feelings of collective victimization which have continued to reinforce and sustain these agitations.\n\nThe major difficulty facing the Nigerian government today is its apparent incapacity to concretely address the challenges of nation-building and by extension, peacebuilding and its perceived inability to strike a balance of economic development along its ethnic divisions. In the meantime the debate on whether restructuring is the silver bullet or whether referendum is the key continues to rage on.\n\nIt, therefore, becomes imperative that to achieve national integration in Nigeria, the government at the center has, first of all, to demonstrate a genuine and sincere commitment to giving all ethnic nationalities that make up the federation an equal sense of belonging as well as an equitable share in the Nigeria project. There is also need for the different ethnic groups to discuss and agree on thorny national issues such as zoning of political posts, boundary adjustments, indigene vs settler disagreements, militancy and youth restiveness, resource control, religious fundamentalism and intolerance, amongst others.\n\nIn conclusion, it is an unimpeachable proposition that citizenship rights in any republic is at the very heart of any sincere and sustainable integration or re-integration agenda, and for people of the Southeast, fifty years after the Biafra War, citizenship is so ill defined and ill protected that the itinerant Igbo is still made not to know when and how he is a citizen anywhere in Nigeria. The Igbo have become a people denied the cure for the ravages of a war which ended with a \u2018No victor, No vanquished\u2019 slogan, but yet a people surrounded by the lingering pain of defeat\u2026. A sincere commitment to post war reintegration does not create a continuous state of occupation and siege where police and soldiers have taken over roads in the South in pole to pole vindictive checkpoints, and Customs officers continue to mount roadblocks with the attendant extortions especially along Igbo trade routes; reintegration should not translate to a multiplicity of taxes levied upon Igbo traders and the patently unfair patterns of their assessment, the constant shifting and relocation of markets by some state governments as part of the ploy to compel Igbo traders to develop new hamlets; reintegration should neither involve the systematic de-industrialization and the lack of investment in commercial industries in the Southeast nor a subterranean re-echoing of the post-war Indigenization policy that ostensibly excluded Igbos from a share in private companies \u2026.Reintegration is not attainable by the reinforcement of a system that denies them employment on an equal basis in the federal bureaucracy and government-owned commercial institutions; reintegration should not connote a blatant lopsidedness both in state and local government creations; it does not involve the neglect and systematic decay of federal roads in the Southeast and the downgrading of its airports or its non-inclusion in the national railway plan; reintegration as a policy should not advance a broad daylight and brutal annexation agenda of Igbo ancestral lands by sheer force of arms under the guise of \u2018open grazing\u2019, neither should it subject helpless villagers to mindless massacres by Fulani herdsmen in southern farmlands; reintegration does not translate to subjecting unarmed protesters who make legitimate demands for their rights to brutal clampdowns whilst treating armed bandits in the North and killer herdsmen that have invaded the South with executive indulgence; reintegration does not involve reminding the Igbo at every turn and opportunity, that they lost a war, and therefore must continue to be held down by state sanctioned shackles which preclude them from aspiring to high public office, and most importantly, from aspiring to lead a country within which they are assured presumably to enjoy full citizenship rights\u2026 and no reintegration gestures are not exhibited by, or tantamount to adding salt atop the injuries of a race that has experienced firsthand the horrors of war by making inflammatory remarks or threats to communicate to them in a language they will understand\u2026.Ladies and gentlemen, these are the hallmarks of victimization, persecution and marginalization, not reintegration, and any honest and sincere intention to integrate and reconcile Nigerians must begin, not with artificial policy constructs such as those highlighted in this presentation but with these seemingly mundane matters which fundamentally affect the lives, existence and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens irrespective of tribe and creed.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has warned the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to stop linking him to the re-arrest of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nNgige, who gave this warning in a statement issued by his media office in Abuja at the weekend, said that he was too engaged with his duties as the Chief Labour Officer of the country and, therefore, does not have time to meddle into security and diplomatic matters, which clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Security and National Intelligence Agencies.\n\nThe minister described the statement by the IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, attempting to link him with the arrest of Kanu as deceitful, mischievous, malicious and wicked, adding that both IPOB and the IPOB spokesman, know him very well as a man who calls \u201ca spade a spade\u201d and has no room for equivocation or speaking from both sides of the mouth since his days as governor in Anambra State.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe attention of the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Dr. Chris Nwabueze Ngige (OON) has been drawn to series of fictitious reports in the social media linking him to the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The first of such reports alleged that Senator Ngige and the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu visited the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs Catriona Laing, to discuss the affairs of IPOB, as supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cAs if this was not enough, the same merchants of disinformation have besieged the social media and this time, the Sahara Reporters, with another fabricated, nauseating and vexatious report, alleging that Sen. Ngige, Governor Willie Obiano, Governor Nyesom Wike and Sir Emeka Offor, conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu and assisted in his arrest. Going through the news item, whereas they alleged that Governors Obiano and Wike funded the operation and that Sir Emeka Offor offered to set up a parallel Radio Biafra, no role was ascribed to the Honourable Minister at all. So, this so-called IPOB intelligence Unit-M Branch report is nothing but massive tissues of lies from the pit of hell, as it concerns the Minister.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we wish to use this medium to set the records straight for the benefit of unsuspecting members of the public who may have been deceived by the wicked lies being circulated in the social media by unscrupulous and mischievous characters whose intent is to malign the person of the Honourable Minister and through that, put him in disrepute.\n\n\u201cFirstly, Ngige did not at any time pay a visit to the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, to discuss the affairs of IPOB. It happened that on May 13, 2021, the Minister was returning from an official meeting of the Economic Sustainability Committee held in the Presidential Villa and passing by, paid a courtesy visit to his brother and friend, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu whose home is within the vicinity of the Villa Pilot Gate.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, Kalu had some guests in his house at the same time. Sen. Kalu introduced his guests, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria and her officials and the Minister exchanged pleasantries with them, stayed briefly and left after a group photograph. During this \u2018chance encounter\u2019, there was never a time the affairs of the proscribed IPOB came up. Senator Kalu had also debunked this report in an earlier statement through his media aide, stating this same account. Mischievously, it was this photograph that had been earlier published in The Sun Newspapers that these evil minded persons are now circulating in order to get even with the Minister and Senator Kalu.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the report by IPOB, posted in Sahara Reporters, alleging that Ngige, Willie Obiano, Nyesom Wike and Emeka Offor conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu is a figment of the imagination of the writers and the spokesman of the IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful and his likes who thrive in mischief, brainwashing and deceit. Everybody knows that the Labour Ministry is one of the busiest ministries in the country today because of the numerous industrial disputes arising from the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and by extension, on the earning powers of employees and employers, necessitating continued bickering and re-negotiations of Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) all over the public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cNgige is occupied, involved and engrossed with his duties as the Labour and Employment Minister, member of Federal Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and member of the Economic Sustainability Committee constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari, which is headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with the mandate to tackle the challenges and fallouts of COVID-19 and post COVID-19 era. Most recently, he was appointed as a member of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to work assiduously to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years. All these are besides other demanding engagements of the Minister of Labour and Employment, playing supervisory role over several federal parastatals under his ministry. On these assignments, the minister is putting all his energy and wealth of experience in order not to disappoint all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, unthinkable that somebody with grey matter in his brain, except if he is hallucinating like the IPOB spokesman, could accuse a very busy minister like Senator Ngige of being part of a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 for the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu. The minister, being somebody with long standing experience in the public service, knows the bounds of his office and does not have the time to meddle into Foreign Affairs of Extradition and security matters that clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Diplomatic Missions, national intelligence agencies. Ngige is neither the Minister of Police Affairs, Justice, Foreign Affairs nor the National Security Adviser, to start discussing issues of extradition or arrest of a fugitive outside Nigeria\u2019s territory, which are clearly outside his mandate\n\n\u201cIf these false reports are targeted at coaxing Ngige into lending his voice to the discordant voices condemning or hailing Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s arrest or calling for his unconditional release, then the propagators have failed because he has long decided not to make any comment for or against Kanu as he is already standing trial in a competent court of law for treasonable felony. Ngige is somebody who believes in the rule of law and will rather allow the law to take its course than get involved in the discussion of any issue, which neither adds nor subtract any value to the trial process. Hence, the minister has not and will not at this time of the country\u2019s history, waste his precious time discussing such matters or any issue pertaining to IPOB.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s earlier views on the ill-advised violent secessionist agitations are well known and can be seen online in his interview with Channels Television aired on Monday June 14, 2021. He is a patriot and firm believer in a united and indivisible Nigeria based on justice, equity and fair play. His position has not changed and is unlikely to change in the near or distant future. He saw and participated in the war and up till today, describes war as \u2018evil\u2019 and an \u2018ill wind\u2019 that blows no side any good.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

It continues to violate civil and political rights with impunity,\u201d CORE said in a statement.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe arrest of five youths for wearing \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d T-shirts to a church is absurd. The arrest of 47 unarmed persons participating in a peaceful ethnic-nationalist demonstration for self-determination and refusal to grant them bail is equally repressive.\n\n\u201cAnd the \u201carrest\u201d of Nnamdi Kanu of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) smacks of the same cloak and dagger attempt to abduct Umaru Dikko from London in 1984 when a military junta led by the same Muhammadu Buhari held Nigeria in a vice grip of state terror on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWe realize that these are acts to curtail justified and popular anger due to the APC\u2019s failure as a ruling party. But we will not submit to these reactionary attacks.\n\n\u201cThe regime has failed on each of the three pillars of empty promises on which bases it came to power. The economic hardships of poor working people have worsened, corruption stinks to the high heavens under APC as much as it did with the PDP, and assurances of bringing the war with Boko Haram in the northeast have been replaced with the excruciating reality of generalized insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe APC regime\u2019s deceit of \u201cchange\u201d has revealed itself for what it is. We can stop this monster and the system it represents only by fighting against every infraction of injustice it metes out to us. This includes demanding justice, as is the case for over a hundred people killed during the #EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cIt is in this sense that the Judicial Panels of Inquiry into SARS-related killings is of utmost importance. The regime's lies about the extent of that dastardly demonstration of state terrorism have been torn aside at the Lagos State panel.\n\n\u201cEvidence of the killing of at least 98 people has been presented to the Lagos State panel, with autopsy reports backing these. But, while the judicial process is still ongoing, the panel has declared that it is winding up. According to the chair of the panel, Doris T. Okuwobi, this is at the order of the presidency. All the panels of inquiry on SARS across the country are to wind up and submit their reports to the National Council of State by this month. Consequently, the Lagos panel intends to wind up proceedings by 19 July, despite tons of unresolved cases before it.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the government set up the panels as a mere token to appease mass anger. It is not interested in justice because its hands are covered with the blood of slain Nigerians in the first place. But these panels have now been used for expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, and the regime wants to silence the people.

          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "If you\u2019re like me, then your face may be constantly buried in your phone screen. If you\u2019re not scrolling through your favourite social media, you\u2019re having a field day chatting with friends and family.\n\nMost times, I\u2019m scrolling through a sea of cartoonish yellow faces that describe how I feel because sometimes, words aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIn a world where more people work from home and attend events on Zoom, everyone is likely staring at a screen for the better part of the day. How can we not? It\u2019s how we bridge distance barriers and insulate ourselves from a deadly pandemic.\n\nA South African study on changes in how people perceive technology by Alex Emilio Fischer, Tanya Van Tonder, and other researchers reveals 83% of 405 respondents interviewed, worked and communicated more with technology since COVID-19 became a global pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, talking to someone physically differs from conversing using a 6.5\u201d device. When communicating face-to-face, what you don\u2019t say is more important than what you say.\n\nFacial cues and body language speak louder than you can imagine. Lydia Ramsey, Professional Speaker and Author, says that \u201cEye contact is the most obvious way you communicate. When you are looking at the other person, you show interest.\u201d\n\nRamsey claims studies show that words account for 7% of human communication while body language and tone account for 55% and 38%, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays, the way we primarily communicate doesn\u2019t accommodate body language. It\u2019s left to collect dust behind computer screens and beneath our typing thumbs.\n\nMelanie Chan, Senior Lecturer, Media, Communication and Culture at Leeds Beckett University, feels technology has reduced face-to-face conversations.\n\nInterestingly, we not only talk through our devices, we also speak to them. Smartphone assistants have become so intelligent that I sometimes find myself asking Google Assistant to tell me jokes when I\u2019m bored.\n\nWhile technology has reduced physical communication, it has also helped us keep in touch where actual meetings are impossible. And with the aid of Japanese invention, emojis, we are perhaps retaining some aspects of normal communication.\n\nEmojis: the language of the digital world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Denis Cherkashin on Unsplash\n\nWhen we click on the emoji section of our keyboard, we likely want to convey emotion easily, or words aren\u2019t enough to say what we feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmojis first appeared on Japanese mobile phones in the late \u201990s. Since then, they have evolved into a universal digital language. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named an emoji Word of the Year. Can you guess which one it was? Reply in the comments.\n\nThe popularity of emojis in Japan propelled Google and Apple to have them registered by Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organisation that maintains text standards on computers.\n\nLike the English language, more emojis are being added to the \u201cemoji vocabulary\u201d to express more emotions.\n\nEmojis also have a day set aside to celebrate them. Bizarre? Apparently, World Emoji Day is a big deal.\n\nCreated by Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia \u2014 a wiki for emojis \u2014 the day has two main activities: awards are given to the most popular emojis and new ones are announced.\n\nIntriguingly, World Emoji Day is celebrated on July 17 because Apple\u2019s iOS calendar emoji have the same date. Not to worry, you\u2019ll also see the same on your Google keyboard if you\u2019re an Android user.\n\nWhile emojis might be a universal way of communication digitally, it is still perceived differently by people.\n\nWhat do users think of emojis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can lose nuances of humour, seriousness and even sarcasm when we take words at face value.\u201d This is what Folakemi Olaniyan, final year student of English and Literary Studies, said when I asked her how important she felt emojis were.\n\nTo her, emojis help to define the mood and tone of written text. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can chat and not use emojis,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, as much as she wants to, Olaniyan does not use emojis in a formal setting. She prefers chatting on her phone to having a physical conversation, adding that it saves her from stuttering in real life.\n\nIn contrast, Kunle Agbetiloye, a journalist, prefers physical conversations to any form of digital exchange. But, like Olaniyan, he believes emojis give more meaning to words.\n\n\u201cThere are some statements one makes that need an emoji for the receiver to understand the emotion that accompanies it,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, Agbetiloye maintains that emojis are only necessary for informal conversations. \u201cPersonally, if I feel angry, I won\u2019t send you angry emojis because of its cartoonish look.\u201d\n\nTo test his assertion, during a lull in the conversation, I sent him an angry face emoji. True to form, he didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n\nMy chat with Daniel Whyte, another journalist, was filled with emojis. From how the conversation went, I could deduce just how important emojis were.\n\nFor Whyte, emojis help get the message across faster. In his words, \u201cI use it to communicate simple messages quickly. It saves time and flows easily.\u201d He ends this sentence with a smiling face emoji, expressing how casually the words would have flowed from his mouth in a physical conversation.\n\nLike Olaniyan and Agbetiloye, Whyte maintains that emojis should be reserved for casual conversations and kept from official emails.\n\nUniversal but personal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVyvyan Evans, Linguistics Professor and Author of The Emoji Code: Linguistics Behind Smiley Faces and Scaredy Cats, describes emojis as \u201cincontrovertibly the world\u2019s first truly universal form of communication.\u201d\n\nHowever, emojis are used by people from different cultures and with unique personalities, making meaning relative to who is using them. As a result, emoji translators were created.\n\nUsually, the thumbs-up emoji is understood as commendation or approval, but in Greek culture, it\u2019s an offensive gesture.\n\nSurprisingly, the smiling face emoji symbolises dismissiveness to Chinese people rather than happiness.\n\nRanti Omoloso, a recent university graduate, says he has difficulty chatting with older people as they often misunderstand emojis.\n\n\u201cI try to avoid chatting with parents cause they seem to understand emojis very differently. I don\u2019t like typing long sentences, so I just put a call through,\u201d he says.\n\nKeith Broni, who makes a living from translating emojis, says they are \u201clinguistics tools that are being used to complement our language.\u201d\n\nAlthough Broni believes emojis by themselves cannot be a form of communication, he admits that they play a vital role in digital communication.\n\nAn expert\u2019s take\n\nIn the opinion of Dr Oluwakemi Omole, Assistant Director, Counselling and Human Development Centre, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, communication is an exchange of information, and the medium doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nHighlighting the importance of communication, she says it improves our psychology and sense of self. \u201cIt is very important to our psyche as humans.\u201d\n\nShe also admits that while physical contact feels good, presence \u2014 online or physical \u2014 is what matters most. \u201cYou can be physically present with someone, and you\u2019re not communicating. It\u2019s about exchange and the ability to listen.\u201d\n\nAs a psychologist, Omole says a lot of research has gone into how effective emojis are and if they communicate feelings that cannot be easily expressed in words. She concludes that \u201cemoji is a way of bridging the gap. It is a way of letting people know what you would love to express to them.\u201d\n\nAddressing the question of emojis being a universal language, Omole refutes their ability to be understood universally. \u201cAlthough we feel the same things, the way we express them may differ across cultures.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s World Emoji Day promises the release of emoji 14.0. A new series of emojis that take into account race and gender. With the emoji vocabulary being updated frequently, could they become a stand-alone language?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nWhat happened? Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nPoS outlets are not limited to cash deposits and withdrawals. They also offer services like fund transfers, utility bill payments, and airtime recharge.\n\nYou should read the article by one of our senior reporters, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, to know the views of some PoS users and operators in Nigeria.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nAn insight into how early-stage venture firm, Microtraction, invests.

          "text": "Microblogging platform, Twitter, on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, announced that its disappearing posts feature, Fleets, will no longer be available on the platform.\n\nIlya Brown, Twitter Head of Products and Video ads, said in a blog post that the feature will be scrapped on August 3, 2021.\n\nLaunched on August 17, 2020, Fleet was Twitter\u2019s way of getting those who don\u2019t tweet regularly to do so.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter\u2019s Head of Consumer Product, on March 4, 2020, \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to this feedback and working to create new capabilities that address some of the anxieties that hold people back from talking on Twitter. Today, in Brazil only, we\u2019re starting a test (on Android and iOS) for one of those new capabilities. It\u2019s called Fleets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the number of people joining the conversation with Fleets did not increase. Brown\u2019s blog post revealed that the feature was used mostly as a means of promoting tweets by people who already tweet frequently.\n\nSocial media and disappearing posts\n\nDisappearing posts was first seen on Snapchat with its introduction of Stories in October 2013. It was described as a \u201cnew way to share your day with friends.\u201d The posts last for 24 hours after which they\u2019ll no longer be seen.\n\nThe feature was introduced on Instagram in August 2016. Like Snapchat, Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours of posting. More social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and networking platform, LinkedIn, soon added the feature.\n\nAfter the feature launched on Twitter newly, it suffered stability problems due to heavy usage. Twitter Support tweeted that the rollout of Fleets would be slowed down to \u201cfix some performance and stability problems. If you don\u2019t have the feature yet, you may not get it for a few more days.\u201d\n\nWhile this means the feature was catching on in the beginning, it is not clear why its use reduced.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Twitter declined to give statistics on the usage of Fleets.\n\nHowever, Instagram, claims its Stories see 500 million interactions daily, influencer marketing agency, Mediakix says 150 million \u2014 10% \u2014 of Facebook\u2019s 1.45 billion daily users use Facebook stories. Statista also reveals that daily WhatsApp status users were up to 500 million in Q1 2019.\n\nWith no available data on other platforms\u2019 disappearing posts feature usage, could this mean we\u2019ll see more apps scrap it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter says it has learned from Fleets and will focus on creating other ways to encourage people to join the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Worsening insecurity exposes Nigeria\u2019s weak governance strategy",
          "text": "The security challenge in Nigeria has continued to be a concern to many citizens. The situation appears to be worsening. Fingers are pointing to weak governance strategy as a major drawback at confronting the monster.\n\nThe House of Representatives recently held a Security Summit that drew important personalities from all walks of life. Deliberations were made and promises were also made on implementation of whatever recommendations that would come from the summit.\n\nLast week, the leadership of the House, led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila submitted the Report to President Muhammadu Buhari for possible implementation.\n\nOnly last week, there were terrible cases of wanton killings and abduction by bandits and Fulani herdsmen.\n\nRead Also: Growing insecurity in Nigeria raises economic concerns\n\nScores of persons were reportedly killed in Zagon-Kataf, Kaduna State by a band of rampaging Fulani herdsmen. Emir of Kajuru, also in Kaduna and some members of his household were abducted by bandits and a ransom of N200million placed on them\n\nSome herdsmen also killed a number of people in Enugu State. Somewhere in Kogi State, a traditional ruler was also kidnapped.\n\nExpressing concern at the wave of insecurity in Nigeria, Hassan Stan-Labo, a retired Army colonel, said there may be need for mercenaries to help the country since it seems that government is overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe are overwhelmed. We seem not to fix the problem on our own. Our military needs some fixing. I know what the Nigerian military is capable of, but a lot has gone wrong that needs to be fixed,\u201d he said.\n\nStan-Labo decried the worsening insecurity, lamenting that \u201cWe are losing Nigerians on a daily basis. We can\u2019t keep on going this way. I come from Zagon-Kataf, I know what happened last Sunday. We need to get certain things right. Mercenaries are needed the way things are now.\u201d\n\nThe retired colonel expressed doubt over implementation of the recommendations arising from the House of Representatives\u2019 Security Summit, saying, \u201cIf we are determined, things can change, but unfortunately, we seem to be like people who like talking. We talk and move on. With some determination things can be achieved. We need to change our attitude. There had been similar recommendations in the past, where are we with the implementation? That is the question.\u201d\n\nHe believes that except the Federal Government takes a bold step to punish those who have confessed their terrorist activities, yet remain in the cabinet, Nigeria will not make any headway in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cTo start with, let us do something about those in government, but are known terrorists. Rather than punish such persons, we are making excuses for them and cover up their crimes,\u201d he said.\n\nAccusing government of complicity, Stan-Labo said: \u201cIf you behave in a manner that seems to give impression that you are complicit, then you are complicit.\u201d\n\nStan-Labo also scoffed at the claim by some state actors that \u201crepentant bandits\u201d should be pardoned and re-integrated into society. He said that such attempt in Zamfara and Katsina states failed as the supposedly repented bandits have since moved back to the bush.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that criticism has continued to trail a report that over 2000 ex-Boko Haram insurgents claimed to have repented have been released back into society.\n\nCritics say such a decision was dangerous and cannot help the fight against insurgency.\n\nHe also blamed the high level of criminality and insecurity in the country on high level of poverty, insisting that as long as wealth is not distributed and people are deprived, insecurity will continue to rise.\n\nThe reign of terror across Nigeria is showing no sign of abating. In recent times, the security situation has deteriorated and assumed a frightening proportion.\n\nAlmost all the six geopolitical zones are faced with one form of security challenge or the other.\n\nThough insecurity challenge is not unique to Nigeria, countries globally face one form of insecurity challenge at one point or the other, Nigeria\u2019s situation appears woeful as it does not appear there is serious and genuine effort at bringing an end to the monster.\n\nHardly would a day passes without reports of killings and kidnapping, and other forms of criminal activities, especially in the North.\n\nApart from Boko Haram insurgency, increased attacks on local farmers, killings and kidnapping by suspected Fulani herdsmen have continued unabated.\n\nThese herdsmen have terrorised Nigerians, destroyed properties and communities, maimed, kidnapped for ransom, while leaving tales of anguish on the lips of the people.\n\nThe situation has apparently overwhelmed the security apparati in the country.\n\nJust last weekend, the army spokesman, Onyema Nwachukwu announced the assassination of the former provost of the Nigerian Army, Hassan Ahmed.\n\nAhmed, a major general, was said to be returning to Abuja from Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, when he was attacked around Abaji area council.\n\nUntil his demise, he was a director at the Army Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAlso last week, two first class traditional rulers in the North, Adogu of Eganyi in Ajaokuta, Mohammed Adembe and Emir of Kajuru in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State were kidnapped along with members of their families.\n\nA recent reports show that in the last decade, there were 1,412 incidents of conflict reported in the North Central region and 7,399 deaths across the North Central states of Benue, Plateau, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Kwara and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe report goes further to say that the escalating violence has deeply unsettled the local economy. Agriculture, the mainstay of the region\u2019s economy, has been badly hit.\n\nMany farmers in the affected areas have been forced to abandon their farms for fear of attack.\n\nAnd as a result of the herder-farmer conflict, the Nigerian government loses an estimated $13.7 billion in revenue annually.\n\nA 2021 United Nations report, said the 12-year-old conflict in North East Nigeria has caused, directly and indirectly, the deaths of some 350,000 people, the vast majority of which are children below the age of five.\n\nThis is despite repeated promises by incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and the head of the nation\u2019s security agencies that they are on top of the situation, still nothing has changed.\n\nObservers say that President Buhari\u2019s seeming nonchalant approach in dealing with the situation decisively has fuelled insinuations that the administration was culpable.\n\nThey wondered why the President had not deployed the same military might that was used in fighting secessionist agitators like leader and members of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), and Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cI was attacked in Abuja Maitama area; I was driving with my cousin and we packed; some men came and broke the windscreen of the car and took my documents and other valuables.\n\n\u201cIf all of this can happen in Maitama in the heart of the FCT, Abuja where the elite stay, what then could happen in the areas where the ordinary Nigerians live? That place is few meters to the police headquarters. Let me tell you, this administration is clueless and it is obvious they are confused as far as this security issue is concerned. What is their policy on tackling banditry and crime control, what is their policy on border control? What is their policy on checking unemployment?\u201d Eddy Olafeso, former South West vice chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), wondered.\n\n\u201cDrug and crime, is the new order of the day in Nigeria. This administration is hopeless, the way out is for Nigerians to defend themselves because there is nobody to defend them. You don\u2019t have a country,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, some stakeholders have also advised the government to seek help from foreign friendly countries since it was obvious that it had been overwhelmed.\n\nBut others have warned that the country should tread with caution on the manner and approach of bringing in such assistance.\n\nLawyer and activist, Idowu Omolegan said it was clear that the current administration had no solution to the spate of insecurity bedeviling Nigeria, advising Nigerians to take their destiny in their own hands.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI think it is glaring that President Buhari and his people are confused; where in the world is this sort of killings and atrocities going on. What is even bad is that no one is often held accountable.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very bad as you can see people are being killed and kidnapped daily. We are saying that the President should do more, or resign, let him try and safeguard the lives of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAwolowo said it then that Nigerians would one day fight for themselves and as you can see restructuring would naturally take its course in Nigeria either you like it or not,\u201d Omolegan said.\n\nSpeaking further, he equally charged Nigerians to collaborate with security agencies in the insurgency war and share information on criminal activities of individuals and groups to aid the fight against insurgents.\n\n\u201cI think Nigerians should try and also speak and report any suspicious persons and cases to help the security agencies arrest the security situation we are all into this,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, Dayo Onibiyo, a Media and Communications analyst, noted that much of the buck lies on the Federal Government table because they control the police and other security agencies, stressing that the Buhari administration was not ready to deal with the issue, but was only taking Nigerians for granted.\n\n\u201cYes, the government is culpable, particularly the Federal Government led by Muhammadu Buhari, facing the fact that even governors can\u2019t call out the Area Commanders to act, without the Area Commander first taking clearance from the CP.\n\n\u201cState police commissioners cannot do anything without taking permission from whoever is in Abuja; the responsibility is purely FG\u2019s. It is very, very sad and pathetic. The leadership of the country is taking Nigerians for granted by behaving as if they can\u2019t do more than what they think they have done,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Ahmed Sani Yerima, a former governor of Zamfara State and Presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in this interview with journalists covering the party, speaks on a variety of issues of national interest. JAMES KWEN was there and brings the excerpts.\n\nThe coast is clear, we have less than two years for 2023 general election. Are you still nursing Presidential ambition?\n\nYes, I want to confirm to you that by the Special grace of God, if I\u2019m alive, I, Senator Ahmed Sani, intend to vie for Presidential Office.\n\nIn Nigeria today, the body language politically and naturally, following the outcome of the meeting in Lagos where the Southern Governors met and solicited and asked for the Presidential ticket. Don\u2019t you think, national interest should supersede personal interest?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t see any body language as a law or as a document that guides us in politics in politicking. As far as am concerned, democracy is guided by constitution; by rule of law. It is not personal interest of people, selfish interest of individuals or the projections by other people statements that will guide our democracy. If you look at all other parts of the world, from America that is the leader of democracy of the world, citizens are guided by the document called constitution to aspire for any office.\n\nRead Also: Constitution Review: Why citizens\u2019 participation is critical at public hearings\n\nAs far as I am concerned, Nigeria\u2019s Constitution of today, my party (APC) constitution of today, unless there is any amendment in the future has declared that every Nigerian who is qualified based on the qualification that is enshrined in the constitution should aspire for any office in the land; Governor, State Assembly, National Assembly. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, my constitution both party and national, has not barred me from contesting for Presidency. So no statement of any group can stop me. Because, you see if tomorrow my party comes up and say we have zoned Presidency to the South, Yerima will follow it. I will now know that it is a decision, legally and lawful that is binding on all members of the party. But so longer as the constitution is still saying Nigerian; citizens of Nigeria and APC Constitution is saying citizens of Nigeria, I am a citizen of Nigeria I am going to contest.\n\nThe problem of bandits, kidnappers is very rampant in the country if you eventually get ticket and become President of this country, how do you think this problem can become a thing of the past and what do you think President Buhari ought to have done to solve this problem?\n\nHe has started with the change in the leadership of the military and the arrangements they\u2019re making. You see, initially the President was very soft, some Governors will come and tell him we should negotiate, we are negotiating, some people are saying no, let\u2019s use action but I think now he has resolved by his statement that anybody seen with Ak47 should be shot.\n\nNow with this change in the administration of the military you will go and find out in Zamfara, they have started action just last week and I am sure very soon they will root out all these bandits that are in the bush and the forest and it is going to be history. I knew that this will happen. So I am sure the action he is taking now, one; they have procured a lot of equipment for the military, they have organised the military hierarchy and I think they are now given a lot of support by government both at the national and the state level. So I am sure they are doing well.\n\nRead Also: \u2018Nigeria must adopt new constitution, restructure to avoid imminent disintegration\u2019\n\nWhat I will do as a follow-up to your question is that; one, I believe in state structure of the Police. That is going to take care of all the local problems. I will prefer a situation whereby those people in that state should be made to concentrate in their localities, they know everybody there and they know the new comers, they know their forests, they know their terrain and if you have State Police, all these things will be managed and well handled.\n\nYou said if APC decides to zone it outside the North, you will abide by the decision of the party but you have an ambition because you want to serve your people. Don\u2019t you think you need to opt out of APC?\n\nYou see, I am a very religious person as a Muslim, I know that power comes from God first and if God destined that I\u2019m going to be the President that will not happen. I have never left my party. I started with APP (All Peoples Party) we merged and become ANPP (All Nigerian Peoples Party) and later merged and become APC (All Progressives Congress). So I am a member of APC and I am not in any way thinking of moving from my party to another party. So once there is zoning, I know that my time is off but am sure that God Himself will decide not people.\n\nGiven the practice pattern with regards to power shifting from South to North, if your party did not recommend zoning to the South would you for the purpose of peace and unity of this country would you advice your party to do so?\n\nYou see we are Nigerians and I believe citizenship is very important. I pray that one day we will become like America, UK, France where citizenship overrides all other considerations; ethnic, religious, tribal. All these things are because we don\u2019t take that citizenship as we are supposed to take it. Voters are supposed to determine not me, not you, not any regional Governor. Voters will determine who do they want to elect. Every Nigerian citizen should come out with something that he is going to offer to the people, sell himself. This is what I have for education, housing, infrastructural provision and so on, human development and then they will compare and see between Mr. A and B who is supposed to be our President. It\u2019s not regional.\n\nLet me ask you one question: let\u2019s say now we zone to Rivers State, even within Rivers you see that is Ijaw, that is this and that. Is it politics? Constitution is very clear, people are politically illiterate because they don\u2019t read the constitution even if they read because of personal and selfish interests, they want to acquire power by allocation. It is not done in politics.\n\nPeople should be allowed to go and contest, present themselves, offer what they want to offer to the nation and Nigerians will decide and see who is going to be our best President. So, is not by allocation, zoning or no zoning that is not an issue. As far as I am concerned, it is democracy and democracy has some principles and practices that have to be followed.\n\nNobody will sit in Lagos and said, these governors were elected. Were they elected based on zoning from their states? No! Go to Benue State, tell them that it is now the turn of Idomas will you force the Tivs to vote for that Idoma, but if they have an Idoma candidate that is very good, credible, I am sure the Tivs will not say he is an Idoma. That\u2019s what we should aspire as Nigerians to make sure that citizenship is more important to us than any other.\n\nWhat is your take on the free fall of the Naira as it is now and secondly, the Electoral Act, there are thoughts that you will not have electronic transmission of results. So what is your take?\n\nOn Naira issue, see we have fiscal and monetary policies that are very faulty and the influence of production. You see a situation whereby even toothpick is being imported by businessmen not to talk of rice and others. So we should have a robust and fiscal monetary policies and development strategies that will encourage development of agriculture so that we can produce all we need locally and once your production level increases, the demand for foreign import will not be there. That is only when you have Naira getting its true value. The value is now being determined by import and export which is not a good economy.\n\nSo I\u2019m sure by the time we have industrial policy that is very good, agriculture policy and we can produce what we need even the clothes we wear, some people will go for local suits because we have very good fabrics that are compared to international ones that we import, you will not have high level import. We have to export, and before we were exporting cotton to China, America, now we are importing cotton. We were exporting soya beans but now we are importing soya mills to feed our chickens. This kind of thing has to change.\n\nNow your second question, I support electronic voting. I think that when we were queuing to register (accredit) without this card reader what was happening? People will just sit down and write names and say we have so, so number of people. By the mere introduction of card reader the whole thing has change. You can see that you have your fingerprint and look at what is happening now, registration of voters online. The world is changing, Nigeria has to follow. We need to use technology as much as possible. As far as I am concerned one day we are going to go for electronic voting.\n\nStill on the economy, you have admitted that the economy is too much import dependent but this government has promised us that we are going to diversify. In the last six years, how would you appraise the government in terms of diversification of the economy?\n\nLook at what is happening today; Covid-19 has changed the whole plan of government. When this government came in, I always maintain that the previous administration was selling crude oil at $140 per barrel and suddenly it started blinking and came to below $30 per barrel.\n\nSecondly, as the federal government is struggling to get out of that crisis then Covid-19 came in and has changed the world not only Nigeria. There are so many challenges that affect government policies and programmes. Government will have a good intention but in the end what happens, there are so many factors that would come in.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, today, the Vice President has just said it that they are pumping money to agriculture this year so that people will back to the farm and with the current effort of tackling the armed bandits, people will go to their farms. For the last two years, people in the North cannot go to the farm. Even in the South these herdsmen and farmers conflicts did not allow some people to go to their farms. The efforts that government is now putting in place, I think the problem of diversification will now be moving towards the right track. It is not yet on the right track because of these challenges.\n\nRecently, the Governor of Kaduna State was quoted as saying that kidnapping is business. Also, an Islamic Cleric Sheik Gumi made the same assertion. What is your take on these assertions from the two noble Nigerians?\n\nOf course, we have major problems associated with that, poverty and ignorance, illiteracy. The level of poverty in Nigeria today both North and South is so high that people are looking for any other means of making money and so kidnapping and banditry came and then people started joining. There is no good Christian or no good Muslim who will take gun out who is religiously educated and kill another person. We are worshipping God through prayers as Muslims and to go to heaven. Christians have been going to Church also to go to heaven. But because of poverty and ignorance of our own religions, people will take gun and kill another person or even somebody will connive and sell his brother. This kind of thing is because of poverty but with robust economic programmes and policies of government, with current allocation of N2.3 trillion in this year\u2019s budget for palliatives, I am sure things will change.\n\nNot too long ago the Governor of Zamfara State defected from PDP to APC. There are some members of APC in your state that are still opposed to that defection; on which side are you? Secondly, the Governor himself said the main reason he left for APC is to see whether insecurity will end because if he remains in PDP, he may not get the support of the Federal Government. How do you feel about this?\n\nFor your first question, I am on the side of justice. Those people who are saying that the Governor should not defect, should not be received as I said may be they are not conversant with our Constitution. One lady asked me two days ago how do we stop defection? We can\u2019t. It is part of our political history and development and even in America today people defect because they see where they believe that their people are.\n\nEvery Nigerian knows the history of Zamfara. In 1998 when we started APP, PDP AD and so on, APP won election when I became Governor. In 2003, ANPP won election and in 2007 ANPP won election again and the Governor defected to PDP and in 2011 we recovered our State. When APC came, Yari became Governor two times. So, Zamfara is an APC-controlled traditionally state.\n\nTherefore, the Governor was part of that history. He was in APP in 1998, he contested for local government election. APP won seven local government areas including the State capital and we lost seven, including his own and I made him Commissioner for Local Government and he was supervising the candidate that defeated him and he went to House of Representatives after been Commissioner and when the Governor then, my former Deputy defected to PDP, he followed him and won his election into the House of Representatives. Now he decided to come back home. If you see the picture we have this morning, only two people; Yari and Kabiru Marafa, they will come soon. We are going to be a family as will used to be before. So I\u2019m on the side of justice. The justice is that the Governor has come, we have received him and there will be no problem.\n\nFor the issue of security or insecurity, even myself could not go to the Governor and offer constructive advice because as an APC member if I openly go and start talking to him some people will say may be I am trying to cause more problems for him but now we are in the same party. I used to go to his office and give him advice on how to tackle the issue of insecurity but now I can go all out and take him to the President, we will discuss because our party now has the responsibility to make sure that not only we win elections but we satisfied the yearnings and aspirations of our people.\n\nLet me take you back to the economy, it is widely acclaimed that the APC-led administration is plunging the country into a serious debt. Just this week, the Senate approved about $2.4 trillion loan request from government. God\u2019s willing, if you become President, are you not worried over this development?\n\nWell, I want to tell you that every country will continue to face challenges over time. We used to have a situation whereby, the President of Nigeria then, or Head of State made a statement that: \u2018our problem is not money but how to spend it\u2019. But afterwards, Nigeria started having problem to the extent that we even went into very serious debt. Obasanjo came and tried as much as possible to exit Nigeria from debt. He almost achieved that. In fact, that\u2019s why two days ago I was saying, he is one of the best President. People will not know until history of Nigeria is written. Obasanjo did very well. He almost exited Nigeria from total debts but Yar\u2019Adua came and when he died, Jonathan was there for six years and went back to debt. Why? Not because of Jonathan but because the economy started having problems. The structural changes that we faced, the challenges that the President faced of Boko Haram required a lot of resources. There were so many problems in the Niger Delta until that discussion between the Niger Delta youths and government took place and then government came up with things that resolved that.\n\nSo this current administration like I said earlier, started with a very bad economic parameters. When the crude oil was $140 to dropped down to $30, what do you expect them to do? They have to go into debt. Covid-19 is also another problem. Like I told you the production system is having very serious problem, not only issue of insecurity. Even UK is going to debt, Europe is printing more currency. So, it is an economic problem that is being faced by Nigeria and the ability of a leader to come up with robust policies and programmes to solve this problem is what is going to make him a good leader.\n\nI want to assure you that, having seen the history of Nigeria as an Economist, I read Economics at Degree and Masters levels, I have studied the economic policies and programmes of the past administrations. I have seen what is happening today so we are now preparing to see what economic policy that will take into consideration the challenges that this administration is facing and what new things we can bring to make sure that the economy is getting back to its normal situation, whereby debt relief is not been sought. We will not even go for new debt but it depends on the parameters of the economy. It is not me that will determine what we happen tomorrow only God knows that. There could be more difficult situations but to face the challenge of difficult situation is what will make you a leader.\n\nIf Buhari did not come with anti-corruption programmes and corruption was given free hand like it used to happen before, we will not be talking now. We would have been like Rwanda or any other country that is facing crisis all over the world. This banditry is because of poverty. If there is increasing poverty and nothing is done, people will go all out looking for whatever they have to do to make sure that they feed their families. So I\u2019m sure that the government is on track and I we will also follow suit to make sure that we come out with robust policies and programmes that will make sure that we are out of this debt.\n\nYou talked about State Police and there are those who are arguing that having State Police is like scratching the issue on the surface. Will you rather advocate for a complete devolution of power in the country, and what plans do you have for Nigerians in the Diaspora?\n\nOn the devolution powers like I told you is already happening. I am sure that there is an agreement reached between the National Assembly, it ought to do with constitutional amendment. The constitution has not been amended, the judiciary (State) has been given financial autonomy, State Assembly Members have been given financial autonomy and I hope very soon they will give local government also financial autonomy. Once that is done, the yearnings of the people that are saying that there should be restructuring will be met.\n\nResource control, if you look at the history of Nigeria, during the first republic, our major export earners were crops; cotton, groundnut, cocoa and so on. These were the things we were exporting and these were the revenue that developed the oil sector and we didn\u2019t know may be in future also, oil will disappear. The effort of government to also explore oil in the North will reduce this pressure from the South saying that the North is not contributing because they have forgotten that the North has contributed earlier before we get the oil. It was the federal government that financed the exploration of oil through the export of cash crops.\n\nSo, I believe that we are all Nigerians. What we need to do is to look at the system and see how best the system will work. Those who are advocating for division of this country are only doing it for selfish interest. I don\u2019t see us divided because we are better together, we don\u2019t know how God decided to bring us together and only Him can change the situation. So, we will look at the democracy that we are operating and see what amendments can we do in the constitution so that everybody will be happy with the situation. If we say zoning should be part of constitution let it be. But once you put zoning in the constitution even zoning of the Presidency to the South-East, some people will say Onitsha people are different from Enugu people or there are different types of Igbos. If you send it to South-South, they will say Ijaw or Itsekiri.\n\nIt is better we develop this concept of citizenship. Every citizen of Nigeria should have freedom of association, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and freedom of movement as provided by the constitution. You can live in Zamfara, Rivers, Ile-Ife, you can live anywhere as a Nigerian. Once we accept that, all these problems will not be there.\n\nFor those in Diaspora, every crisis you see there must be a reason for it. The problem of Nigerians in Ghana is because they are doing well. The problem of Nigerians in South America is because they are doing well. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, the economic problem that is facing the world is the one causing all this crisis and you cannot say I call Nigerians back. There has to be the interaction between the government of Nigeria and government of Ghana and any other country to make sure that our citizens are properly protected.\n\nThe foreign policy of Nigeria should be geared towards making sure that citizens of Nigeria operate freely without any hindrance and that is what we need to do as far is this issue is concerned. We should not just said come back It is not the solution because we need to ask them to go out like other people are coming here to earn a living. So is not their problem but the problem of that government. Government should be very strong on those countries that are allowing our citizens to be bastardised.\n\nAfter the defection of Governor Matawalle, he said he is the new leader of APC in Zamfara State and before then there was leadership crisis in the party. Don\u2019t you think that will affect you and who do you recognise as leader?\n\nDo you have the knowledge of APC Constitution? The APC Constitution is very clear, President is leader of APC in Nigeria and every Governor is the leader of APC in his State. So there is no crisis as far as that one is concerned. Nobody will allocate leadership. I was Governor in 1999, I left office my Deputy took over he became leader of the party and after him, Yari came and now Matawalle is there, he is the leader of the party as per APC Constitution. The crisis that happened in 2019 election will not happen again because at that time there was no proper primary election and that is the crisis we found ourselves.\n\nIn Zamfara, this is the first time that we have such crisis. We had election in 1999, there was no problem, we had election in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 because once you are just and fair to all, you make sure that you allow free and fair election, there will be no problem.",
          "summary": "Therefore, as far as I am concerned, my constitution both party and national, has not barred me from contesting for Presidency.\nPeople will just sit down and write names and say we have so, so number of people.\nAs far as I am concerned one day we are going to go for electronic voting.\nDo you have the knowledge of APC Constitution?\nThe APC Constitution is very clear, President is leader of APC in Nigeria and every Governor is the leader of APC in his State.",

These steps are critical as we begin to see worrisome early signs of increasing cases in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe statement also announced some recommendations to avoid the spread of the infections during and after the celebration of the Islamic festival of Eid-el-Kabir which comes up on Tuesday, July 20.\n\nOn eid prayer\n\nThe committee recommends the decentralisation of the eid prayer on the day of the festival. It said rather than allowing large gatherings at community central prayer grounds, outside of the neighbourhood mosques where Friday prayers are usually said should be used for the eid prayer.\n\n\u201cThe PSC felicitates with the Muslim Ummah on the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. It however, urges all State Governments and Religious Leaders to be mindful of the potential for wider spread of the virus during large gatherings. The PSC, therefore, recommends the following preventive measures for a safe Eid-el-Kabir celebration: a) Decentralization of Eid Prayer to neighborhood Friday Prayer Mosques (outdoor); b) Suspension of Durbar activities; and c) Observation of limitations on all Indoor gatherings,\u201d the statement added.\n\nOn durbar activities\n\nThe durbar event, which has become a major tourist attraction, is an age long celebration organised in many northern Nigerian cities and usually involves colourful parades of the emirs and their entourage on horses, who are accompanied by musicians.\n\nThe event\u2019s potential to attract large numbers of participants which may be difficult to control is said to have informed the committee\u2019s recommendation.\n\nOn border posts\n\nThe committee promised that the surveillance at the nation\u2019s border posts and particularly the airports will be strengthened, saying the existing quarantine protocols and restrictions shall be sustained.\n\n\u201cThe PSC shall continue to minimise the risk of importation of Variants of Concern into the country by strengthening Surveillance at all Points of Entry (POE), enforcing extant quarantine protocols and sustaining the current restrictive measures against travelers arriving from India, Brazil, Turkey andSouth Africa,\u201d it said.\n\nFCT to shut parks\n\nMeanwhile, the Abuja management has issued guidelines ahead of the Eid-el-Kabir celebrations, announcing the closure of recreation centres within the FCT throughout the festive period.\n\nThe management, in a statement issued on Saturday night, and signed by Anthony Ogunleye, the chief press secretary to the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, noted that the decisions were taken at the meeting of an emergency operations committee on COVID-19 in the capital city.\n\nThe statement reads in part; \u201cAll Eid prayers in the FCT are to be held in the open spaces at Jumaat Mosques as well as the National Eid Ground\u2026All open Eid grounds should have multiple entry and exit points with hand washing and temperature checking facilities; the holding capacity of Eid grounds should be reduced to 50% to ensure physical/social distancing.\n\n\u201cImams should ensure that sermons are short so that the entire Eid prayers do not exceed one hour; all parks and recreational grounds and facilities shall remain closed throughout the festive period, and worshippers are enjoined to adhere to all prescribed non-pharmaceutical preventive measures of facial coverings, constant hand washing and physical distancing.\u201d",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) kept mum up till yesterday evening over the alleged arrest and detention of three Israeli filmmakers by its operatives in Anambra State on July 9.\n\nThe Israelis, Rudy Rochman, a Zionist activist; filmmaker Noam Leibman; and French-Israeli journalist E. David Benaym, were reportedly arrested over allegations of supporting the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that they took off from Ben Gurion Airport on July 5 and landed in Nigeria the next day.\n\nIt reported that according to locals, the crew was detained at a synagogue during Friday night services in the village of Ogidi and flown to Abuja where they have been detained since then.\n\nMessages sent to the DSS spokesman, Dr Peter Afunanya, for his response on the matter had not been replied to at the time of filing this report.\n\nBenyam, it was learnt, was temporarily released from police custody on Tuesday evening and handed over to the French Embassy in Abuja for unspecified medical reasons.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that they were shooting a documentary when they were arrested. The paper said this was confirmed by the Foreign Ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli paper, family members of one of the men stressed that the allegations were entirely unfounded, and that separatist social media accounts took advantage of the Israelis\u2019 trip to claim that the three were supporting Biafran separatist groups.\n\nThe Israelis were in Nigeria to film \u201cWe Were Never Lost,\u201d a documentary exploring Jewish communities in African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda and Nigeria.\n\nThe paper reported that relatives of the filmmakers said the gifting of a Torah scroll to the local community was \u201ctwisted\u201d by local political actors to imply political backing for separatist political ambitions.\n\nIn their statement, the families explained that the filmmakers had brought gifts for the communities hosting them.\n\n\u201cThe filmmaking crew thought it would be a nice gesture to bring several gifts with cultural symbolism to the communities it planned to visit,\u201d the families said in their statement, adding that one of the gifts was the Torah scroll.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, members of non-state political groups have hijacked for their own purposes images of the filmmakers gifting a Torah to a local community.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are distorting the intentions of the filmmakers in an effort to manufacture a connection to local political matters when no such connection exists.\n\n\u201cThese politically motivated actors have taken a simple gesture of kindness and twisted it in an attempt to create an alternate meaning.\n\n\u201cThe documentary series is designed to educate viewers about the religious and cultural experiences of lesser-known Jewish communities. Their goal is to interview members of Jewish communities across multiple African countries, along with Jewish communities in China, India, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis documentary is not intended to make any political statements about the countries in which filming will take place, nor does the filmmaking team endorse any political movements. The filmmaking crew acts as a guest visiting the country and its various communities \u2013 there are no political overtones.\n\n\u201cWe are working diligently with the US, Israeli and French Embassies on the matter, and we greatly appreciate the attention they have given to the situation. Their involvement has helped to improve the conditions of the filmmakers while in custody \u2013 including the delivery of kosher meals prepared by the local Chabad.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the DSS will quickly conclude what the facts support \u2013 that the filmmaking team has no political motives and that the team should be released from custody as soon as possible,\u201d the families said.\n\nThe newspaper quoted an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying on Wednesday that one of the detainees, Benaym, was temporarily released from police custody on Tuesday and handed over to the French Embassy in Abuja for unspecified medical reasons.\n\nIt reported: \u201cThe families confirmed the details, stating that \u2018as a sign of appeasement, the DSS allowed the French Embassy to host Edouard David Benaym on Tuesday night to receive some medical attention, with the intention of having him return to DSS custody the next day to continue the investigation.\n\n\u201cWhile a family friend of one of the detainees told The Times of Israel that former Israeli minister Ayoub Kara had flown to Nigeria to assist in the talks, the ministry spokesman said Kara happened to already be in Nigeria and was not involved in the diplomatic effort. Kara did not respond to a request for comment.\u201d\n\nStop linking me to Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s re-arrest, Ngige tells IPOB\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, yesterday asked the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to stop linking him to the re-arrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nNgige said as the Chief Labour Officer of the country, he lacked the time to meddle in security and diplomatic matters, which clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Security and National Intelligence agencies.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his media office in Abuja, the minister described the statement by the IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, attempting to link him with the arrest of Kanu as deceitful, mischievous, malicious and wicked.\n\nThe minister said both IPOB and its spokesperson know him (Ngige) very well as a man who calls \u201ca spade a spade\u201d and has no room for \u201cequivocation or speaking from both sides of the mouth\u201d since his days as governor in Anambra State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statements reads: \u201cThe attention of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has been drawn to series of fictitious reports in the social media linking him to the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cThe first of such reports alleged that Senator Ngige and the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, visited the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs Catriona Laing, to discuss the affairs of IPOB, as supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cAs if this was not enough, the same merchants of disinformation have besieged the social media and this time, the Sahara Reporters, with another fabricated, nauseating and vexatious report, alleging that Sen. Ngige, Governor Willie Obiano, Governor Nyesom Wike and Sir Emeka Offor, conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu and assisted in his arrest.\n\n\u201cGoing through the news item, whereas they alleged that Governors Obiano and Wike funded the operation and that Sir Emeka Offor offered to set up a parallel Radio Biafra, no role was ascribed to the Honourable Minister at all. So, this so-called IPOB intelligence Unit-M Branch report is nothing but massive tissues of lies from the pit of hell, as it concerns the Minister.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we wish to use this medium to set the records straight for the benefit of unsuspecting members of the public who may have been deceived by the wicked lies being circulated in the social media by unscrupulous and mischievous characters whose intent is to malign the person of the Honourable Minister and through that, put him in disrepute.\n\n\u201cFirstly, Ngige did not at any time pay a visit to the British High Commissioner to Nigeria to discuss the affairs of IPOB. It happened that on May 13, 2021, the Minister was returning from an official meeting of the Economic Sustainability Committee held in the Presidential Villa and passing by, paid a courtesy visit to his brother and friend, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, whose home is within the vicinity of the Villa Pilot Gate.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, Kalu had some guests in his house at the same time. Sen. Kalu introduced his guests, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria and her officials and the Minister exchanged pleasantries with them, stayed briefly and left after a group photograph.\n\n\u201cDuring this \u2018chance encounter\u2019, there was never a time the affairs of the proscribed IPOB came up. Senator Kalu had also debunked this report in an earlier statement through his media aide, stating this same account. Mischievously, it was this photograph that had been earlier published in The Sun newspaper that these evil minded persons are now circulating in order to get even with the Minister and Senator Kalu.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the report by IPOB, posted in Sahara Reporters, alleging that Ngige, Willie Obiano, Nyesom Wike and Emeka Offor conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu, is a figment of the imagination of the writers and the spokesman of the IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful and his likes, who thrive in mischief, brainwashing and deceit.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that the Labour Ministry is one of the busiest ministries in the country today because of the numerous industrial disputes arising from the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and by extension, on the earning powers of employees and employers, necessitating continued bickering and re-negotiations of Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) all over the public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cNgige is occupied, involved and engrossed with his duties as the Labour and Employment Minister, member of Federal Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and member of the Economic Sustainability Committee constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari, which is headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with the mandate to tackle the challenges and fallouts of COVID-19 and post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cMost recently, he was appointed as a member of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to work assiduously to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cAll these are besides other demanding engagements of the Minister of Labour and Employment, playing supervisory role over several federal parastatals under his Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn these assignments, the Minister is putting all his energy and wealth of experience in order not to disappoint all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unthinkable that somebody with grey matter in his brain, except if he is hallucinating like the IPOB spokesman, could accuse a very busy Minister like Senator Ngige of being part of a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 for the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cThe Minister, being somebody with long standing experience in the public service, knows the bounds of his office and does not have the time to meddle into Foreign Affairs of Extradition and security matters that clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Diplomatic Missions, national intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cNgige is neither the Minister of Police Affairs, Justice, Foreign Affairs nor the National Security Adviser to start discussing issues of extradition or arrest of a fugitive outside Nigeria\u2019s territory, which are clearly outside his mandate.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cIf these false reports are targeted at coaxing Ngige into lending his voice to the discordant voices condemning or hailing Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s arrest or calling for his unconditional release, then the propagators have failed because he has long decided not to make any comment for or against Kanu as he is already standing trial in a competent court of law for treasonable felony.\n\n\u201cNgige is somebody who believes in the Rule of Law and will rather allow the law to take its course than get involved in the discussion of any issue which neither adds nor subtract any value to the trial process. Hence, the Minister has not and will not at this time of the country\u2019s history, waste his precious time discussing such matters or any issue pertaining to IPOB.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s earlier views on the ill-advised violent secessionist agitations are well known and can be seen online in his interview with Channels Television aired on Monday June 14, 2021. He is a patriot and firm believer in a united and indivisible Nigeria based on Justice, Equity and Fair-play. His position has not changed and is unlikely to change in the near or distant future. He saw and participated in the war and up till today, describes war as \u2018evil\u2019 and an \u2018ill wind\u2019 that blows no side any good.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) kept mum up till yesterday evening over the alleged arrest and detention of three Israeli filmmakers by its operatives in Anambra State on July 9.\n\nThe Israelis, Rudy Rochman, a Zionist activist; filmmaker Noam Leibman; and French-Israeli journalist E. David Benaym, were reportedly arrested over allegations of supporting the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that they took off from Ben Gurion Airport on July 5 and landed in Nigeria the next day.\n\nIt reported that according to locals, the crew was detained at a synagogue during Friday night services in the village of Ogidi and flown to Abuja where they have been detained since then.\n\nMessages sent to the DSS spokesman, Dr Peter Afunanya, for his response on the matter had not been replied to at the time of filing this report.\n\nBenyam, it was learnt, was temporarily released from police custody on Tuesday evening and handed over to the French Embassy in Abuja for unspecified medical reasons.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that they were shooting a documentary when they were arrested. The paper said this was confirmed by the Foreign Ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli paper, family members of one of the men stressed that the allegations were entirely unfounded, and that separatist social media accounts took advantage of the Israelis\u2019 trip to claim that the three were supporting Biafran separatist groups.\n\nThe Israelis were in Nigeria to film \u201cWe Were Never Lost,\u201d a documentary exploring Jewish communities in African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda and Nigeria.\n\nThe paper reported that relatives of the filmmakers said the gifting of a Torah scroll to the local community was \u201ctwisted\u201d by local political actors to imply political backing for separatist political ambitions.\n\nIn their statement, the families explained that the filmmakers had brought gifts for the communities hosting them.\n\n\u201cThe filmmaking crew thought it would be a nice gesture to bring several gifts with cultural symbolism to the communities it planned to visit,\u201d the families said in their statement, adding that one of the gifts was the Torah scroll.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, members of non-state political groups have hijacked for their own purposes images of the filmmakers gifting a Torah to a local community.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are distorting the intentions of the filmmakers in an effort to manufacture a connection to local political matters when no such connection exists.\n\n\u201cThese politically motivated actors have taken a simple gesture of kindness and twisted it in an attempt to create an alternate meaning.\n\n\u201cThe documentary series is designed to educate viewers about the religious and cultural experiences of lesser-known Jewish communities. Their goal is to interview members of Jewish communities across multiple African countries, along with Jewish communities in China, India, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis documentary is not intended to make any political statements about the countries in which filming will take place, nor does the filmmaking team endorse any political movements. The filmmaking crew acts as a guest visiting the country and its various communities \u2013 there are no political overtones.\n\n\u201cWe are working diligently with the US, Israeli and French Embassies on the matter, and we greatly appreciate the attention they have given to the situation. Their involvement has helped to improve the conditions of the filmmakers while in custody \u2013 including the delivery of kosher meals prepared by the local Chabad.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the DSS will quickly conclude what the facts support \u2013 that the filmmaking team has no political motives and that the team should be released from custody as soon as possible,\u201d the families said.\n\nThe newspaper quoted an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying on Wednesday that one of the detainees, Benaym, was temporarily released from police custody on Tuesday and handed over to the French Embassy in Abuja for unspecified medical reasons.\n\nIt reported: \u201cThe families confirmed the details, stating that \u2018as a sign of appeasement, the DSS allowed the French Embassy to host Edouard David Benaym on Tuesday night to receive some medical attention, with the intention of having him return to DSS custody the next day to continue the investigation.\n\n\u201cWhile a family friend of one of the detainees told The Times of Israel that former Israeli minister Ayoub Kara had flown to Nigeria to assist in the talks, the ministry spokesman said Kara happened to already be in Nigeria and was not involved in the diplomatic effort. Kara did not respond to a request for comment.\u201d\n\nStop linking me to Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s re-arrest, Ngige tells IPOB\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, yesterday asked the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to stop linking him to the re-arrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nNgige said as the Chief Labour Officer of the country, he lacked the time to meddle in security and diplomatic matters, which clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Security and National Intelligence agencies.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his media office in Abuja, the minister described the statement by the IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, attempting to link him with the arrest of Kanu as deceitful, mischievous, malicious and wicked.\n\nThe minister said both IPOB and its spokesperson know him (Ngige) very well as a man who calls \u201ca spade a spade\u201d and has no room for \u201cequivocation or speaking from both sides of the mouth\u201d since his days as governor in Anambra State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statements reads: \u201cThe attention of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has been drawn to series of fictitious reports in the social media linking him to the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cThe first of such reports alleged that Senator Ngige and the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, visited the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs Catriona Laing, to discuss the affairs of IPOB, as supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cAs if this was not enough, the same merchants of disinformation have besieged the social media and this time, the Sahara Reporters, with another fabricated, nauseating and vexatious report, alleging that Sen. Ngige, Governor Willie Obiano, Governor Nyesom Wike and Sir Emeka Offor, conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu and assisted in his arrest.\n\n\u201cGoing through the news item, whereas they alleged that Governors Obiano and Wike funded the operation and that Sir Emeka Offor offered to set up a parallel Radio Biafra, no role was ascribed to the Honourable Minister at all. So, this so-called IPOB intelligence Unit-M Branch report is nothing but massive tissues of lies from the pit of hell, as it concerns the Minister.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we wish to use this medium to set the records straight for the benefit of unsuspecting members of the public who may have been deceived by the wicked lies being circulated in the social media by unscrupulous and mischievous characters whose intent is to malign the person of the Honourable Minister and through that, put him in disrepute.\n\n\u201cFirstly, Ngige did not at any time pay a visit to the British High Commissioner to Nigeria to discuss the affairs of IPOB. It happened that on May 13, 2021, the Minister was returning from an official meeting of the Economic Sustainability Committee held in the Presidential Villa and passing by, paid a courtesy visit to his brother and friend, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, whose home is within the vicinity of the Villa Pilot Gate.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, Kalu had some guests in his house at the same time. Sen. Kalu introduced his guests, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria and her officials and the Minister exchanged pleasantries with them, stayed briefly and left after a group photograph.\n\n\u201cDuring this \u2018chance encounter\u2019, there was never a time the affairs of the proscribed IPOB came up. Senator Kalu had also debunked this report in an earlier statement through his media aide, stating this same account. Mischievously, it was this photograph that had been earlier published in The Sun newspaper that these evil minded persons are now circulating in order to get even with the Minister and Senator Kalu.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the report by IPOB, posted in Sahara Reporters, alleging that Ngige, Willie Obiano, Nyesom Wike and Emeka Offor conspired and betrayed Nnamdi Kanu, is a figment of the imagination of the writers and the spokesman of the IPOB, Mr. Emma Powerful and his likes, who thrive in mischief, brainwashing and deceit.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that the Labour Ministry is one of the busiest ministries in the country today because of the numerous industrial disputes arising from the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and by extension, on the earning powers of employees and employers, necessitating continued bickering and re-negotiations of Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) all over the public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cNgige is occupied, involved and engrossed with his duties as the Labour and Employment Minister, member of Federal Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and member of the Economic Sustainability Committee constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari, which is headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with the mandate to tackle the challenges and fallouts of COVID-19 and post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cMost recently, he was appointed as a member of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to work assiduously to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cAll these are besides other demanding engagements of the Minister of Labour and Employment, playing supervisory role over several federal parastatals under his Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn these assignments, the Minister is putting all his energy and wealth of experience in order not to disappoint all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unthinkable that somebody with grey matter in his brain, except if he is hallucinating like the IPOB spokesman, could accuse a very busy Minister like Senator Ngige of being part of a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 for the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cThe Minister, being somebody with long standing experience in the public service, knows the bounds of his office and does not have the time to meddle into Foreign Affairs of Extradition and security matters that clearly fall within the mandate of the Nigerian Diplomatic Missions, national intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cNgige is neither the Minister of Police Affairs, Justice, Foreign Affairs nor the National Security Adviser to start discussing issues of extradition or arrest of a fugitive outside Nigeria\u2019s territory, which are clearly outside his mandate.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cIf these false reports are targeted at coaxing Ngige into lending his voice to the discordant voices condemning or hailing Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s arrest or calling for his unconditional release, then the propagators have failed because he has long decided not to make any comment for or against Kanu as he is already standing trial in a competent court of law for treasonable felony.\n\n\u201cNgige is somebody who believes in the Rule of Law and will rather allow the law to take its course than get involved in the discussion of any issue which neither adds nor subtract any value to the trial process. Hence, the Minister has not and will not at this time of the country\u2019s history, waste his precious time discussing such matters or any issue pertaining to IPOB.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s earlier views on the ill-advised violent secessionist agitations are well known and can be seen online in his interview with Channels Television aired on Monday June 14, 2021. He is a patriot and firm believer in a united and indivisible Nigeria based on Justice, Equity and Fair-play. His position has not changed and is unlikely to change in the near or distant future. He saw and participated in the war and up till today, describes war as \u2018evil\u2019 and an \u2018ill wind\u2019 that blows no side any good.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By David Adeoye\n\nOyo State Government said men of the Nigeria Customs Service raided Igangan and other parts of Ibarapa areas of the state on Friday night, not herdsmen.\n\nMr Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Seyi Makinde, said in a statement on Saturday in Ibadan, that this was contrary to the widely circulated report that unidentified gunmen attacked the areas.\n\nAdisa said that the revelation was made known by Ibarapa Community leaders during a fact-finding meeting between a team of the state government and political/traditional leaders of the affected communities on Saturday.\n\nAccording to him, the state government team was led by Mr Sunday Odukoya, the Executive Assistant on Security Matters to the governor.\n\n\u201cThe political and traditional leaders of Ibarapa extraction at the meeting, described the Friday raid on Igangan, Igbo-Ora and other communities in the area by men of the NCS, as unnecessary and not well-thought-out.\n\n\u201cThey called on the leadership of Custom Service to regulate operations of its personnel.\n\n\u201cIt will be better if the authorities restrict them to border towns to end unwarranted attacks on innocent communities,\u201d Adisa said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s media aide said that Odukoya, who led the state government team to the meeting, called for vigilance and calm among the people.\n\nHe said that police in the areas had confirmed the death of one Amotekun operative and two other persons, following the said raid.\n\nThe team, accompanied by the traditional rulers and community leaders, visited scene of the incident at Igangan, Ayete, Tapa, and Igbo-Ora.\n\nThe leaders, included the Olu of Igbo-Ora, Oba Jimoh Titiloye and the Chairman of Ibarapa North Local Government, Mr Adeoye Adedoyin.\n\nThe Customs also confirmed that it was its men that were erroneously described as herdsmen.\n\nIt said its men were in pursuit of rice smugglers.\n\nFederal Operations Unit Customs Public Relations Officer Theophilus Duniya said three of its officials and a soldier were injured in a shootout with the smugglers.\n\nAccording to Mr Duniya, the incident occurred around 8:00 p.m. on Friday.\n\n\u201cEight trucks carrying contraband foreign parboiled rice were spotted by the injured Customs Officials, who are operatives of the Zone A, Federal Operations Unit, whose drivers and armed accompanying passengers launched an attack on the officers.\n\nOne of the assailants was shot and disarmed, while the rest fled with their illegal goods.\n\n\u201cInvestigations are proceeding to apprehend and prosecute the attackers, and all of the attacked Customs Officers and soldiers are undergoing treatment, including one who was shot in the head,\u201d Mr Daniya said.\n\nHe said that the Acting Controller of the Unit, DC Usman Yahaya, condemned the attack and reaffirmed the Service\u2019s unwavering commitment to combating smuggling.\n\nAccording to the Acting Controller, the Unit will never back down or be frightened by unjustified attacks by criminal elements illegally carrying weapons and unleashing them on officers performing legitimate tasks.",

          "title": "SERAP Gives Buhari-led Government 24 Hours To Withdraw NBC Order On Reporting Of Terrorist Attacks In Open Letter",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has written President Muhammadu Buhari an open letter urging him to use his position of leadership to \u201curgently instruct Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to withdraw the directive containing a gag order prohibiting journalists and broadcast stations from reporting details of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe NBC had issued an order to journalists, television, and radio stations in Nigeria in a letter dated July 7, 2021, requesting them to avoid \u201cglamourizing and giving too much details on the evil acts of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nIn a letter dated 17 July 2021 and signed by Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP stated that the contents of the NBC directive to journalists and broadcast stations are entirely inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nRead the following statement:\n\nWe would be grateful if the repressive directive is withdrawn within 24 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions in the public interest.\n\nThe organization expressed \u201cgrave concern that the contents of the NBC directive would impermissibly restrict the rights to freedom of expression, information, and victims\u2019 right to justice and effective remedies that are central to public debate and accountability in a democratic society.\n\nReporting on the growing violence and killings in many parts of the country is a matter of public interest. The NBC directive to journalists and broadcast stations to stop reporting these cases, coupled with the possibility of fines and other punishment, would have a disproportionate chilling effect on the work of those seeking to hold the government accountable to the public.\n\nThe broad definitions of what may constitute \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourizing\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 heighten concerns of overreach, confer far-reaching discretion on the government, and suggest that the NBC directive is more intrusive than necessary.\n\nThese words and phrases do not indicate precisely what kind of individual conduct would fall within their ambit. The vague and overbroad definitions of \u2018too many details\u2019, \u2018glamourizing\u2019, \u2018divisive rhetoric\u2019, and \u2018security issues\u2019 also raise concern that the NBC directive unduly interferes with the rights to freedom of expression and information, and is disproportionate to any purported legitimate governmental aim. Ill-defined and/or overly broad directives are open to arbitrary application and abuse.\n\nThe use of these words and phrases by the NBC, given their opaque and ambiguous meaning, leaves open the possibility for application beyond unequivocal incitement to hatred, hostility, or violence. Such words and phrases may function to interpret legitimate reporting by broadcast stations, journalists, and other Nigerians as unlawful.\n\nExacerbating these concerns are growing restrictions of civic space, the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and the attempts by your government to push for the amendment of the Nigeria Press Council Act and the National Broadcasting Commission Act, to further suppress media freedom, freedom of expression and access to information.\n\nAllowing the media to freely carry out their duties is essential to building a secure society and leaving no one behind. Conversely, imposing impermissible restrictions on broadcast stations, journalists and other Nigerians undermine the security that builds a healthy and vibrant society.\n\nArticle 19(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights establishes the right to freedom of opinion without interference. Article 19(2) establishes Nigeria\u2019s obligations to respect and ensure this right, which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and through any media of one\u2019s choice.\n\nUnder Article 19(3), restrictions on the right to freedom of expression must be \u2018provided by law\u2019, and necessary \u2018for respect of the rights or reputations of others or \u2018for the protection of national security or of public order, or public health and morals.\n\nAlthough article 19(3) recognizes \u2018national security as a legitimate aim, the Human Rights Council, the body charged with monitoring implementation of the Covenant, has stressed \u2018the need to ensure that invocation of national security is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression.\u2019\n\nSince article 19(2) promotes so clearly a right to information of all kinds, this indicates that your government bears the burden of justifying any restriction on reporting of cases of violence and killings, and withholding of such information as an exception to that right.\n\nAny restrictions should be applied strictly so that they do not put in jeopardy the right itself. The NBC directive to broadcast stations fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The requirement of necessity also implies an assessment of the proportionality of restrictions such as those being imposed by the NBC, to ensure that restrictions target a specific objective and do not unduly intrude upon the rights of targeted persons.\n\nThe interference with the constitutional and legal duties of journalists and broadcast stations cannot be justified in the context of the right to information, as the NBC directive has not shown that their reporting would impose a specific risk of harm to a legitimate State interest that outweighs the public\u2019s interest in such information.\n\nThe NBC directive may also create an environment that unduly deters and penalizes broadcast stations and journalists, and the reporting of government wrongdoing more generally. The Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression has concluded that national security considerations should be limited in application to situations in which the interest of the whole nation is at stake, which would thereby exclude restrictions in the sole interest of a government, regime, or power group.",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",
          "summary": "Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy.\nThe actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it.\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\nRegrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.",

          "text": "The tempo and condition of statehood at every point in time will go a long way to determine the next phase of political experience and actions. For example, by May 29, 2023, northern Nigeria through President Muhammadu Buhari would have presided over Nigeria for eight (8) years.\n\nAnd historically, no particular zone whether north or south had continued ruling Nigeria consecutively after the two terms of eight years.\n\nI believe the above understanding should form the kernel of strategies for all political parties in Nigeria to adopt in their quests to expand or take over political leadership.\n\nBy this, All Progressive Congress \u2013 APC, being the ruling political party, for now, should be seen to be delivering leadership and communicating the right geopolitical balancing roadmap.

Therefore, invariably this is the year of PDP and her horde of members to decide; a big decision indeed.\n\nThe stuff of this big decision in the forthcoming PDP National Convention will either make or mar the PDP. The future of PDP lies in the new restructuring, new zoning realignments, and the eventual big decision. A good decision will bring victory while a bad decision will spell doom.\n\nThe sympathy and consciousness for power to go south have become heavier and proper, hence I will advise the PDP family to as a matter of urgency to zone the next chairmanship position of PDP to the north in preparation for the party\u2019s presidential primary election 2022/2023.\n\nOwing to the reconciliation jobs being carried out in PDP thus far, getting a vibrant northerner to lead PDP to victory has already been made easy. Let us look inwards; the northerners are capable. The PDP has prepared for a day like this long ago.\n\nThe decision of the southern governors should be taken seriously for PDP to survive. The majority of PDP governors are from southern Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, let us look at the north for the next PDP National Chairman, while we prepare for a southern presidential candidate in 2023. This is the time to sacrifice.\n\nAfter eight (8) years of President Buhari\u2019s government \u2013 a northerner, who on earth should plan to take power again back to the north for the next eight years? It is a wrong strategy for a nation and for a political party. Where is the geopolitical fairness and balancing? Some strategies to win elections at the state level may not be applicable at the national.\n\nIt all started in 1999, when the military, who were mostly northern heads, felt that political power should go to the people after a long period of agitation.\n\nTo accommodate the different diversities and geopolitical cleavages and snaps in Nigeria, political parties were structured to accommodate these sentiments through rotational presidency and zoning. For the first instance, the south was considered, and the southwest became the beneficiary.\n\nBut this did not come to the southwest on a platter of gold but on a very rugged toil of both sweat and blood.\n\nAt a point the journey became fatal and the southwest lost an eminent leader, a business cum political behemoth, a foremost philanthropist, the Late Chief M.K.O Abiola, to the struggle.\n\nChief MKO Abiola, a southerner, had won the 1993 presidential election but was unjustifiably denied by the military junta of President Ibrahim Babangida. It became a complicated case of the former drinking a diplomatic tea that never came to digest. It was a case of death around the dining table.\n\nTherefore, structuring for the Presidential election of February 27, 1999, the first election since the 1993 military grip, the three prominent political parties all featured only candidates from the southwest; this was to make it easy for the southwest to scale through and rule Nigeria, and also for tension to reduce nationally.\n\nChief Olusegun Obasanjo, from the southwest, was elected to fly the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party \u2013 PDP, while Chief Olu Falae, from the same southwest, was elected to fly the joint flag of Alliance for Democracy and All Peoples Party (AD-APP).\n\nThis cooperation and understanding happened in Nigeria; it was so peaceful and it became a typical birth of fresh air.\n\nThen there was nothing like the south contesting against the north or vice versa, and no zone was opposing any zone.\n\nSubsequently, Chief Obasanjo on rounding up arranged for the same understanding for the north, and Late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, a northerner, became the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria. The 16-year PDP government was anchored on this understanding.\n\nIt happened in 2015 when a big but bad decision ended the 16-year reign of the Peoples Democratic Party \u2013 PDP. The big bad decision arising from mismanagement of power-sharing and its attendant zoning imbroglio between north and south had conspired to show PDP the exit door from power.\n\nThe then powerhouse, the PDP government under the leadership of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan had insisted that Jonathan must continue to contest the upcoming presidential election of 2015, not minding the monstrosity of the pending wrecking zoning quagmire that lurked within.\n\nBut the northern PDP leaders, including their governors, were quick to tell President Jonathan to complete his joint ticket with Late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and leave the stage for them to continue, and allow them to have their full tenure from 2015.\n\nBut Mr. Jonathan who had tested power to its fullest, after exhausting the timeline of less than half of the four-year tenure of Yar\u2019Adua plus his (Jonathan) official four years, making it five years in office, disagreed and could not accept that there was zoning or any gentleman agreement to support the worries of powershift from the PDP north.\n\nSo, the leaders of PDP mostly northerners and some other members from the south like Chief Olusegun Obasanjo became deeply upset and combined to set out for a complete battle royale against Jonathan.\n\nThis tussle led to fission of interest in PDP, whereby the northern PDP governors pitted ferociously against President Jonathan.\n\nOther prominent northern leaders like Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who felt it was their turn to rule, teamed up with other fleeing northern PDP governors, including northern PDP members of the National Assembly, to advance support and consolidate the buildup of APC, and supported Buhari to stop Jonathan, and this took away the hard-earned political power from PDP.\n\nEqually in this uproar were other northern leaders, some who pretended to be with Jonathan and PDP, yet they only worked with PDP in the morning and hobnobbed APC at night. Prominent among them were Dr. Mu\u2019azu Babangida Aliyu and Alhaji Adamu Mu\u2019azu.\n\nRecall that Aliyu in a statement said that the 19 northern governors worked against Jonathan\u2019s reelection in 2015 because there was an agreement with Jonathan to serve only one term which Jonathan reneged on.\n\nHowever, Jonathan had called Aliyu a pathological liar and a backstabber, while former governors Jonah Jang and Sule Lamido denied knowledge of such agreement cited by Dr. Aliyu.\n\nAgain, President Jonathan, as the 2015 elections approached, became terribly hypnotized that at a point he had to make his arch challenger and a black sheep, Adamu Mu\u2019azu, as his PDP National Chairman, purposely, to facilitate his (Jonathan) returning as the next president. But, Mr. Mu\u2019azu chose to tow the way of APC north.\n\nIn the book, \u2018Against the Run of Play\u2019, written by Segun Adeniyi, chairman of THISDAY editorial board, Jonathan alleged that Muazu worked against him in the election: \u201cWhat happened was very sad, not for me as a person, but for our democracy. Take, for instance, the PDP National Chairman, Alhaji Adamu Mu\u2019azu. I believe he joined in the conspiracy against me. For reasons best known to him, he helped to sabotage the election in favor of the opposition.\u201d\n\nNow, zoning might be an internecinal monster, but then, it has made some states in Nigeria such as Delta state, Lagos state, etc., rotate and share political power within its different senatorial zones, thereby fostering fairness, equity, and justice, while other states such as Rivers and Benue have thrived productively without zoning.\n\nIn Nigeria, zoning should be left for states to handle in accordance with their prevailing political vagaries and peculiarities. Though some political parties in Nigeria are yet to master the consciousness and skills of applying and withdrawing the zoning sentiment, consequently, they have continued to lose at different general elections in different states.\n\nBut at the center, considering the heterogeneous and humongous nature of Nigeria, the system of allowing power to rotate between north and south should be sanctioned and sustained. In every eight-year two terms, each of the zones, north or south, should be able to produce a president, as this will engender internal cohesion, fairness, peace, equity, and justice in Nigeria.\n\nNo doubt, the naivety of Mr. Jonathan ensnared him, and that cost PDP the presidency.\n\nThe zoning contraption became so byzantine that the PDP defense force was used to build the backbone and stabilize the bourgeoning alchemy of APC strange bedfellows.\n\nThis is the summary of the story of how PDP fell from power and has become a front seat opposition in Nigeria \u2013 the aftermath of a big and bad decisions.\n\nYet again, all events preceding the 2019 elections afforded PDP an opening to clean her house and right her wrongs.\n\nThe sober move in PDP started when her members who moved to APC were quickly betrayed by the APC leadership. Soonest, members who left for APC started thinking of retracing steps. The PDP governors who left to become senators and new governors under APC were fast to enter into an alliance with APC leadership, but at last, they were denied and rejected by both Buhari and Tinubu.\n\nBut the PDP which they had abandoned, soon, came to excavate them from the APC dungeon and therefrom forming a new alliance which led to Senator Bukola Abubakar Saraki of APC and Senator Ike Ekweremadu of PDP becoming the president of the senate and deputy respectively.\n\nGradually, the PDP that earlier lost political power owing to events of 2015 elections began to gather new strength while gaining new grounds.\n\nThe Post-Election Review Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party \u2013 PDP was set up with nine-point terms of reference; the fulcrum of which was to find out what went wrong in the 2015 elections, and to chart a trajectory for the restoration of the fortunes of PDP.\n\nNow, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, then, being the highest political office holder in the opposition PDP chaired the review committee to fathom a panacea among which was to arrange a zoning formula for PDP towards the 2019 presidential election.\n\nThe Ekweremadu committee zoned the PDP presidential ticket to the north, first to correct the error of 2015 thoughtlessness, and second to avoid pitching north directly against the south as was unwittingly undertaken by President Jonathan.\n\nSenator Ike Ekweremadu and his committee members were smart and successful in this assignment, their ingenuity shifted power to the north, which brought an untaken victory to PDP in the 2019 presidential election, as Atiku Abubakar, the chief beneficiary of the struggle, abandoned us so soon in trenches, and left for Dubai, where he had journeyed to holiday and convalesce.\n\nAccording to Ekweremadu \u201cIt is also recommended to the party to strictly apply the zoning principle at all levels. In particular, since the last President of PDP extraction came from the southern part of Nigeria, it is recommended that PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections should come from the northern part of the country\u201d.\n\nIn all this, one thing is clear; it is the political exigencies of a particular period that will determine what will happen next. If any political party should miss this calculation that will be over for it.\n\nAs 2023 gathers momentum, PDP had already assigned the job of zoning the presidency to a committee that was chaired by Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed. The Bala Mohammed could not summon the courage to be exact and specific over where power should go.\n\nThe committee only harangued the members of PDP NWC and pointed at where their group sympathy lies, that is within Southeast and Northeast for the presidential contest 2023. This is where the dichotomy lies.\n\nWhich zone will PDP decide to go, south or north? But, the southern governors have just made this simple.\n\nAccording to Governor Bala Mohammed-led Peoples Democratic Party Committee on the Review of the 2019 General Elections, \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that for fairness and equity, the North-East and South-East geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency should be given special consideration in choosing the presidential flag bearer of the party for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. \u201cMoreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian from every part of the country should be given the opportunity to choose the best candidate through a credible primary election as a way of institutionalizing a merit-based leadership recruitment process for the country.\u201d\n\nNow, you see, this is totally against the leadership push and understanding that threw up Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a northerner, as PDP flagbearer in the presidential election of 2019. And during the PDP presidential primary in Portharcourt, Rivers state. And because Ekweremadu out of patriotism, had zoned power to the north, only northerners contested.\n\nBut, Bala Mohammed, a northerner, heading a PDP review committee, now chose to become economical with the truth, and meandered on a deep hood of indecisiveness.\n\nFor us in 2023, four factors will determine this zoning thing in PDP: first is where the ruling party APC will zone their ticket to. The second is the zone where PDP has more PDP governors, the third is the governorship experience of aspirants, and the fourth will be the Age of an aspirant.\n\nThere is no going back here, we move.\n\nObviously, things are changing globally, there are different realignments within these four variables. The southern governors\u2019 forum has already emerged to push for the southern presidency 2023.\n\nGradually, the dynamics are being set. By 2023 northern Nigeria through President Buhari would have ruled Nigeria for eight (8) years. What is your take?\n\n\u2026 ORIADE, a media content engineering advisor, wrote from Abuja",

The PDP governors who left to become senators and new governors under APC were fast to enter into an alliance with APC leadership, but at last, they were denied and rejected by both Buhari and Tinubu.\n\nBut the PDP which they had abandoned, soon, came to excavate them from the APC dungeon and therefrom forming a new alliance which led to Senator Bukola Abubakar Saraki of APC and Senator Ike Ekweremadu of PDP becoming the president of the senate and deputy respectively.\n\nGradually, the PDP that earlier lost political power owing to events of 2015 elections began to gather new strength while gaining new grounds.\n\nThe Post-Election Review Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party \u2013 PDP was set up with nine-point terms of reference; the fulcrum of which was to find out what went wrong in the 2015 elections, and to chart a trajectory for the restoration of the fortunes of PDP.\n\nNow, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, then, being the highest political office holder in the opposition PDP chaired the review committee to fathom a panacea among which was to arrange a zoning formula for PDP towards the 2019 presidential election.\n\nThe Ekweremadu committee zoned the PDP presidential ticket to the north, first to correct the error of 2015 thoughtlessness, and second to avoid pitching north directly against the south as was unwittingly undertaken by President Jonathan.\n\nSenator Ike Ekweremadu and his committee members were smart and successful in this assignment, their ingenuity shifted power to the north, which brought an untaken victory to PDP in the 2019 presidential election, as Atiku Abubakar, the chief beneficiary of the struggle, abandoned us so soon in trenches, and left for Dubai, where he had journeyed to holiday and convalesce.\n\nAccording to Ekweremadu \u201cIt is also recommended to the party to strictly apply the zoning principle at all levels. In particular, since the last President of PDP extraction came from the southern part of Nigeria, it is recommended that PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections should come from the northern part of the country\u201d.\n\nIn all this, one thing is clear; it is the political exigencies of a particular period that will determine what will happen next. If any political party should miss this calculation that will be over for it.\n\nAs 2023 gathers momentum, PDP had already assigned the job of zoning the presidency to a committee that was chaired by Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed. The Bala Mohammed could not summon the courage to be exact and specific over where power should go.\n\nThe committee only harangued the members of PDP NWC and pointed at where their group sympathy lies, that is within Southeast and Northeast for the presidential contest 2023. This is where the dichotomy lies.\n\nWhich zone will PDP decide to go, south or north? But, the southern governors have just made this simple.\n\nAccording to Governor Bala Mohammed-led Peoples Democratic Party Committee on the Review of the 2019 General Elections, \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that for fairness and equity, the North-East and South-East geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency should be given special consideration in choosing the presidential flag bearer of the party for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. \u201cMoreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian from every part of the country should be given the opportunity to choose the best candidate through a credible primary election as a way of institutionalizing a merit-based leadership recruitment process for the country.\u201d\n\nNow, you see, this is totally against the leadership push and understanding that threw up Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a northerner, as PDP flagbearer in the presidential election of 2019. And during the PDP presidential primary in Portharcourt, Rivers state. And because Ekweremadu out of patriotism, had zoned power to the north, only northerners contested.\n\nBut, Bala Mohammed, a northerner, heading a PDP review committee, now chose to become economical with the truth, and meandered on a deep hood of indecisiveness.\n\nFor us in 2023, four factors will determine this zoning thing in PDP: first is where the ruling party APC will zone their ticket to. The second is the zone where PDP has more PDP governors, the third is the governorship experience of aspirants, and the fourth will be the Age of an aspirant.\n\nThere is no going back here, we move.\n\nObviously, things are changing globally, there are different realignments within these four variables. The southern governors\u2019 forum has already emerged to push for the southern presidency 2023.\n\nGradually, the dynamics are being set. By 2023 northern Nigeria through President Buhari would have ruled Nigeria for eight (8) years. What is your take?\n\n\u2026 ORIADE, a media content engineering advisor, wrote from Abuja",
          "summary": "Therefore, invariably this is the year of PDP and her horde of members to decide; a big decision indeed.\nThe stuff of this big decision in the forthcoming PDP National Convention will either make or mar the PDP.\nThe future of PDP lies in the new restructuring, new zoning realignments, and the eventual big decision.\nThis tussle led to fission of interest in PDP, whereby the northern PDP governors pitted ferociously against President Jonathan.\nThe second is the zone where PDP has more PDP governors, the third is the governorship experience of aspirants, and the fourth will be the Age of an aspirant.",

          "title": "How Can You Become A Space Tourist?",
          "text": "Thrill-seekers might soon be able to get their adrenaline kicks \u2014 and envy-inducing Instagram snaps \u2014 from the final frontier, as space tourism finally lifts off.\n\nAll you\u2019ll need is a bit of patience. And a lot of money.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of where things stand.\n\nWho\u2019s offering spaceflights?\n\nTwo companies are offering short \u201csuborbital\u201d hops of a few minutes: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson.\n\nBlue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket takes off vertically and the crew capsule detaches and crosses the Karman line (62 miles, or 100 kilometers, in altitude), before falling back to Earth with three parachutes.\n\nVirgin Galactic uses a massive carrier plane, which takes off from a horizontal runway then drops a rocket-powered spaceplane. This in turn soars to over 50 miles altitude before gliding back.\n\nIn both cases, up to six passengers are able to unbuckle from their seats to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and take in the view of Earth from space.\n\nWhen can you go?\n\nVirgin Galactic has said regular commercial flights will begin from 2022, following two more test flights. Their waiting list is already long, with 600 tickets so far sold.\n\nBut the company predicts it will eventually run up to 400 flights per year. Two seats on one of the first flights are up for grabs in a prize draw: registrations are open until September 1.\n\nAs for Blue Origin, no detailed calendar has been announced.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning for two more flights this year, then targeting many more in 2022,\u201d a spokesperson told AFP.\n\nAnother way to get to space is via reality television. Space Hero, an upcoming show, says it plans to send the winner of a competition to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2023.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThe first tickets sold by Virgin Galactic went for between $200,000 and $250,000 each, but the company has warned that the cost for future sales will go up.\n\nBlue Origin hasn\u2019t announced prices. The anonymous winner of a public auction for a seat on the first crewed flight paid $28 million, but decided to defer their trip.\n\nIt\u2019s not known what amount was bid for the seat secured by Dutch teen Oliver Daemen, who will fly in the auction winner\u2019s place.\n\nThe more \u201cbudget conscious\u201d might consider spending $125,000 for a seat on Space Neptune: a capsule that offers 360 degree windows and is lifted to the upper atmosphere by a balloon the size of a football stadium.\n\nDespite the promise of spectacular views, the balloon ascends only 19 miles \u2014 far from the boundary of space, and weightlessness.\n\nThe 300 seats for 2024 have all been sold, but reservations are open for 2025.\n\nAre the physical requirements tough?\n\nNo \u2014 you\u2019re only expected to be in reasonable shape. Virgin Galactic\u2019s training lasts just five days.\n\nBlue Origin promises to teach you everything you need to know \u201cthe day before you launch,\u201d and its first crewed flight includes pioneering aviator Wally Funk, who at 82 will become the oldest astronaut.\n\nThe company\u2019s requirements include being able to climb seven flights of stairs in under 90 seconds (the height of the launch tower) and being between 5\u20190\u2033 and 110 pounds (152 centimeters and 50 kilograms) and 6\u20194\u2033 and 223 pounds (193 cm and 100 kg).\n\nWhat about SpaceX?\n\nElon Musk\u2019s company is also getting into the space tourism game, but its plans involve journeys that are far longer. The costs are also predicted to be astronomical \u2014 tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn September, American billionaire Jared Isaacman has chartered a mission called Inspiration4 to take him and three other passengers into orbit around the Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, launched into space by a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThen in January 2022, three businessmen will travel to the ISS with an experienced astronaut. The mission, named Ax-1, is being organized by the company Axiom Space, which has signed up for three other future flights with SpaceX.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s company is also planning a trip to orbit for four people, organized by intermediary Space Adventures \u2014 the same company in charge of the flight of the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa to the ISS in December, aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.\n\nMaezawa is also supposed to take a trip around the Moon in 2023, this time aboard a rocket that is still under development by SpaceX, called Starship.\n\nHe invited eight members of the public to join him \u2014 but applications are now closed.",

          "text": "\u2022Institutes claim against Belgian over attempt to auction $5m Ife head\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has in clear terms ruled out turning over the 1,130 Benin bronzes presently in possession of the German government to any individuals or subnational groups when the artefacts are finally repatriated to the country by August 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed made this clarification on Saturday while addressing the press in Lagos on the efforts by the federal government to repatriate looted and smuggled artefacts from around the world.\n\nThe remarks on the heels of the controversy between the Oba of Benin Ewuare II and the Governor of Edo State Mr Godwin Obaseki over who should take possession of the artefacts.\n\nWhile the monarchy is backing the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or alternatively, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the governor has vouched for a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nWhile shedding light on the controversy, Mohammed said that the return of the artefacts was being negotiated bilaterally between the federal government Nigeria and Germany in line with international best practice and the operative conventions and laws.\n\nThe minister, who last week led a federal delegation to Berlin to negotiate with the German authorities on the modalities for the unconditional repatriation of the artefacts that were looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897, during a raid by the colonial government, insisted that Nigeria, rather than any sub group was the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from the country.\n\nHe added that international conventions recognized cultural heritage as properties that belong to a nation but not individuals and sub-national groups.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, the Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany. Let me state clearly here that, in line with international best practice and the operative Conventions and laws, the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of Nigeria and Germany.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe relevant international Conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added that Article 1 of the UNESCO Convention in 1970, defined cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation;\n\nHe stressed that the article allowed an individual nation to determine what it regards as its cultural property, adding the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments \u2013 has in working assiduously over the past years to repatriate the looted artefacts in collaboration with important traditional institutions and state governments.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying in essence is that the Federal government will take possession of these antiquities, because it is its duty to do so, in line with the extant laws. But we have always exercised this right in cognizance of that culture that produced the art works. That is why the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments have always involved both the Edo State government and the Royal Benin Palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe minister also revealed that the federal government has instituted a claim in Paris before the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to it Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP), against a Belgian who wanted to auction an Ife Bronze head valued at $5 million, at least.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Ife Bronze antiquity had been seized by the London Metropolitan Police, pending the decision on who the true owner is.\n\nIn addition, he said the federal government had also secured a date in October 2021 for the repatriation of antiquities from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n\nHe said the antiquities consisted of two important Benin Bronzes and an exquisite Ife Bronze head.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, even though not everyone in possession of these artefacts is willing to return them, we remain undeterred as we have deployed all legal and diplomatic means and we have been recording successes in our quest for repatriation. Here are some of the successes we have recorded since that press conference in 2019:\n\n\u2013 In October 2020, The Netherlands returned a highly-valued 600-year-old Ife Terracotta.\n\n\u2013 In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze from its collections. We shall take possession of this in October this year.\n\n\u2013 In April 2021, we received a bronze piece from Mexico.\n\n\u2013 The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has also agreed to return a disputed Benin artefact. We will soon commence the procedure for the repatriation of this highly-valued piece\u201d.\n\nThe minister assured that the federal government will ensure the repatriation of not just the Benin artefacts, as it is equally working towards repatriating Ife Bronzes and Terracotta, Nok Terracotta, Owo Terracotta, the arts of the Benue River Valley, the Igbo Ukwu, the arts of Bida, the arts of Igala, Jukun among others.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
          "summary": "The remarks on the heels of the controversy between the Oba of Benin Ewuare II and the Governor of Edo State Mr Godwin Obaseki over who should take possession of the artefacts.\n\u201cGentlemen, the Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany.\nHe said the antiquities consisted of two important Benin Bronzes and an exquisite Ife Bronze head.\n\u2013 In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze from its collections.\n\u2013 The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has also agreed to return a disputed Benin artefact.",

          "text": "A bright blue painting sits upon the soaked debris scattered around the streets of Stolberg in western Germany, marking the studio of local artist Dennis Brandt.\n\nInside, more wreckage is piled in a heap and drenched sketches peel from the walls where floodwaters rose almost to the ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe town has been destroyed, everything really, streets and houses,\u201d Brandt told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cMy studio, 20 years of work, paintings, everything is gone. It was a painting school for children as well, now that\u2019s gone too.\u201d\n\nAmong his now-destroyed collection was a post-apocalyptic view of Stolberg that he had painted last year, which depicted high waters lapping around the town\u2019s marketplace. Brandt could scarcely believe it had become a reality.\n\n\u201cMany of my friends no longer have a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a war.\u201d\n\nThe scenes of devastation in Stolberg were replicated across swaths of western Germany and Belgium this week as floods devastated low-lying towns in the region.\n\nIn Germany, at least 133 people have died, making it the worst natural disaster to hit the country in almost 60 years.\n\nThe Ahrweiler district south of Cologne reported at least 90 dead, among them 12 residents of a care home for the disabled.\n\nThe tragedy has raised widespread concerns that German authorities have not done enough to prepare for increasingly frequent bouts of extreme weather, driven by climate change.\n\nBetween Tuesday and Thursday, an unusually static low-pressure zone dumped record levels of rainfall, with the worst-affected areas battered by intense storms over Wednesday night.\n\nSome received as much as two months of rainfall in just 24 hours, Germany\u2019s meteorological agency said.\n\nTens of thousands of emergency services and at least 850 soldiers have been deployed to affected areas, using helicopters, armoured vehicles and boats to rescue people trapped by the waters and search through the remains of destroyed buildings.\n\nRescue operations continue, but have been hampered by extensive damage to infrastructure, with many roads damaged or impassable, phone networks down in several areas, and more than 100,000 people without power as of Friday evening.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Erftstadt in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) on Saturday, offering consolation to those hit by tragedy.\n\n\u201cWe mourn with those that have lost friends, acquaintances, family members,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fate is ripping our hearts apart.\u201d\n\nArmin Laschet, premier of NRW and favourite to succeed Angela Merkel as Chancellor after September\u2019s elections, appeared alongside Steinmeier, and promised swift financial assistance to those affected.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything so that what needs to be rebuilt can be rebuilt.\u201d\n\nThough floodwaters have receded in many areas, authorities remain on high alert.\n\nAbout 700 residents from one district of Wassenberg, next to the Dutch border, were evacuated last night as a dam on the Ruhr broke.\n\nWassenberg Mayor Marcel Maurer said the situation was stabilising, but it was \u201ctoo early to give the all-clear\u201d.\n\nGermany\u2019s meteorological service has also issued weather alerts for south east Bavaria this weekend, where flooding is expected on the Danube.\n\nDuring his 20 years living in Erftstadt, Johannes Ahrends never had cause to worry about the calm, narrow river from which the town takes its name.\n\nBut this week\u2019s deluge sent torrents rushing downstream, overwhelming flood defences and engulfing the town.\n\nHomes were gutted by the rising waters and cars now lie scattered like toys amid the debris.\n\nIn nearby Blessem, the waters filled a gravel quarry, triggering a landslide that collapsed several houses and a historic castle.\n\nAuthorities rescued 170 people, many of them airlifted to safety.\n\nNo fatalities have yet been confirmed, though soldiers continue to search cars on an engulfed stretch of motorway nearby, where it is not known whether all drivers escaped.\n\nThough Ahrends\u2019 own home is located about 400 metres away from the flood, others were less fortunate.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine who lived in that area lost all of his clothes, his house, his car, everything,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs soldiers arrived to help and the sounds of helicopters filled the air, locals began their own initiative, he said, setting up a Facebook group to coordinate and supply sandbags and food for their neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe need new infrastructure, but in this area Blessem there\u2019s a hole with a depth of 10 metres, so how can you ever recreate it? It\u2019s so frightening and unbelievable that part of the town is really gone and there\u2019s no chance to rebuild it.\u201d\n\nThe disaster has prompted questions about whether Germany\u2019s flood warning systems are adequate for increasingly unpredictable weather events in an ever-warming climate.\n\nEmergency warnings and evacuation notices were issued when real-time river sensors detected a massive spike in water levels.\n\nBut smaller streams and tributaries not previously perceived as threats were not monitored as closely, Rhineland Palatinate\u2019s environment minister acknowledged.\n\n\u201cExtreme rains were in the forecast, but not consistently at the right locations and in the right magnitudes,\u201d said Andreas Fink, a climate researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cThere were warnings, but villages along the small river in the Eifel were not evacuated.\u201d\n\nFink said improved forecasting and evacuation procedures should be implemented quickly.\n\n\u201cHigher dykes and better infrastructure take time, but we need the decisions now,\u201d he added.\n\nThe disaster has once again forced climate to the front of the political agenda just months before federal elections.\n\nThough Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats have maintained a comfortable polling lead, her successor Laschet is widely seen as weak on climate protection for his support for coal mining and the auto industry \u2013 with an article in influential weekly Zeit on Friday describing him as a \u201cRealpolitker on the run from reality\u201d.\n\nBut for now campaigning has been suspended and politicians are focused on assisting the victims and mourning the dead.\n\nAhrends\u2019 first concern is for the reconstruction of Erftstadt and the rehousing of his neighbours, but he knows that the town\u2019s plight is a sign of an increasingly unpredictable future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this is climate change,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Martine Mo\u00efse, the wife of Haiti\u2019s assassinated president who was injured in the July 7 attack at their private home, returned to the Caribbean nation on Saturday following her release from a Miami hospital.\n\nHer arrival was unannounced and surprised many in the country of more than 11 million people still reeling from the killing of Jovenel Mo\u00efse in a raid authorities say involved Haitians, Haitian-Americans and former Colombian soldiers.\n\nMartine Mo\u00efse disembarked the flight at the Port-au-Prince airport wearing a black dress, a black bulletproof jacket, a black face mask, and her right arm in a black sling as she slowly walked down the steps of what appeared to be a private plan one by one. She was greeted by Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph and other officials.\n\nEarlier this week, she tweeted from the Miami hospital that she could not believe her husband, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was gone \u201cwithout saying a last word,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis pain will never pass.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, government officials had announced that Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s funeral would be held on July 23 in the northern Haitian city of Cap-Haitien and that his wife is expected to attend.\n\nShe arrived hours after a key group of international diplomats on Saturday appeared to snub the man currently running Haiti by urging another politician, the designated prime minister, to form a government following Mo\u00efse\u2019s killing.\n\nJoseph has been leading Haiti with the backing of police and the military despite the fact that Mo\u00efse had announced his replacement a day before the president was killed.\n\nJoseph and his allies argue that the designated successor, Ariel Henry, was never sworn in, though he pledged to work with him and with Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti\u2019s inactive Senate.\n\nThe statement was issued by the Core Group, which is composed of ambassadors from Germany, Brazil, Canada, Spain, the U.S., France, the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.\n\nThe group called for the creation of \u201ca consensual and inclusive government.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo this end, it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government,\u201d the group said.\n\nU.S. officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A U.N. spokesman declined comment except to say that the U.N. is part of the group that issued the statement. Meanwhile, an OAS spokesman only said the following: \u201cFor the moment, there is nothing further to say other than what the statement says.\u201d\n\nHenry and spokespeople for Joseph did not immediately return messages for comment.\n\nThe group also asked that \u201call political, economic and civil society actors in the country fully support authorities in their efforts to restore security.\u201d\n\nRobert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said the statement is very confusing especially after the U.N. representative had said that Joseph was in charge.\n\n\u201cMore confusion in a very confusing and bewildering situation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question of who should take over has been complicated by the fact Haiti\u2019s parliament has not been functioning because a lack of elections meant most members\u2019 terms had expired. And the head of the Supreme Court recently died of Covid-19.\n\nA day after the assassination, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price noted that Joseph was the incumbent in the position and was serving as acting prime minister before the assassination: \u201cWe continue to work with Claude Joseph as such,\u201d he said.\n\nOn July 11, a delegation of representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and National Security Council traveled to Haiti. They reviewed critical infrastructure, talked with Haitian National Police and met with Joseph, Henry and Lambert in a joint meeting.",
