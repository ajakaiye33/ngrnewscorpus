          "title": "How monarchs can help Buhari end insecurity \u2013 Elerinmo",
          "text": "By Chris Onuoha\n\nElerinmo of Erinmo, Oba Michael Odunnayo Ajayi, has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari may have meant well by trying to involve traditional rulers in tackling insecurity, but said that it must be backed with constitutional actions.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that the speech was made in good faith. It is a welcome development coming from the President, but it is not enough to challenge traditional rulers to take charge of their people\u2019s security. What is more important is to empower the traditional rulers to be able to carry out these responsibilities.\n\nMuch as I would like to thank the President for remembering monarchs as the missing link, I would also urge him to take a step further by recognising and stating specific roles for us in the constitution. This will in no small way have positive effects on our present predicaments\u201d, Ajayi said while reacting to the President.s New Year broadcast to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have long been an advocate of making the traditional rulers the fourth tier of the government. Indeed, let me fly a kite here by saying that traditional institutions should actually be the recognised authority at the local government level. Responsibilities must be matched with equal level of authority. Long before Africa was colonised, traditional institutions had existed and had taken charge of not only the security but also the general administration of our people as well as their welfare at the local government level. The real question is why are the traditional rulers not given that role in the Nigerian constitution?\n\n\u201cHowever, it is a known fact that no traditional ruler can turn a deaf ear to the plight of his people. I believe the time has now come to engage monarchs in governance beyond being symbolic representatives of their people. I view the statement from the President as a sign that sooner than later, he will be given more attention and support to the monarchs to take charge of things at the local level and in their respective domains: one of which is to ensure that there is a budget that matches the responsibilities given. I have always wondered why security votes gets to the States but none ever comes to the traditional rulers\u201d.\n\nThe monarch went on: \u201cTalking about the herders and farmers clashes, it has many angles to it. Firstly, I believe the ranks of many of the so called herders has been infiltrated by bad elements or bandits as you call them, who are outrightly there for criminal purposes. Secondly there has always been a competition for available resources between farmers and herders which even from time immemorial, has led to clashes, though not as violent as it is now.\n\nThe world, no doubt has advanced and there are better and more economically beneficial ways to rear animals as well as farming. The government needs to engage the major stakeholders without taking sides to ensure that the other root causes of these problems, the sponsors of these evil and those benefiting from the problems are brought to justice to avoid anarchy.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of state police, I still find it difficult to understand what people mean by that under the present structure we have in Nigeria today. In Yoruba land we say when a child falls he/she looks forward but when an elder falls, he looks back to see the root cause. The way forward is to look back and go back to where we started from. In a country like the United States of America, they have police department structure in each State and County. There is no overall Inspector General of Police.\n\nEvery locality develops the kind of police that suits its needs. Such structure is not enshrined in our constitution for now. That is one area the legislatures have to look into. No doubt all crimes are local to a certain extent but our present federal structure is federal in words but not indeed. I will suggest that the elected parliamentarians should go back to their respective constituencies to get their people\u2019s views and of cause this must involve the traditional institutions to avoid abuse of power before State police becomes a reality.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has sued the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila over their failure to probe alleged missing N4.1 billion public fund budgeted for the National Assembly.\n\nThe suit followed the publication of the annual audited report for 2016 in which the Auditor-General of the Federation raised concerns about alleged diversion and misappropriation of public funds and sought the recovery of any missing funds.\n\nIn the suit filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, the organization is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to perform their constitutional oversight functions to promptly probe the allegations that fresh N4.1bn budgeted for the National Assembly may be missing.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that \u201cthe National Assembly has legal and constitutional duties to prevent and combat corruption, as well as promote transparency and accountability in the management of public resources.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cThe National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201ctransparency and accountability in the management of public resources and wealth are essential for promoting development, people\u2019s welfare and well-being, and their access to basic public services, as well as good governance and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that \u201cThe failure of the National Assembly to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and to refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies the allegations documented in the annual audited report for 2016 is a fundamental breach of the oversight and public interest duties imposed on the legislative body.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe National Assembly has no legally justifiable reason to refuse to investigate the allegations documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe suit read in part: \u201cGranting this application would serve the interest of justice, reduce corruption and mismanagement, as well as end impunity of perpetrators, and advance the fundamental human rights of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201cThis suit seeks to vindicate the rule of law, the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability. Government agencies and institutions are responsible to a court of justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that, the court is the only judge.\u201d\n\nSERAP had last year sent a letter to Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila requesting them to \u201cuse their good offices to urgently probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies allegations that fresh allegations of missing N4.1bn of public money.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cthese fresh allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in the audited reports for 2015, 2017 and 2018 that N4.4 billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated or stolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen. The National Assembly paid some contractors N417,312,538.79 without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount in question from the contractors.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly reportedly spent N625,000,000.00 through its Constitution Review Committee between March and June 2016 but without any document. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount from the Committee.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly spent N66,713,355.08 as \u2018personnel cost\u2019 but \u2018the payees in the Cashbook did not correspond with those in the Bank Statement\u2019. The Auditor-General wants \u2018the irregular expenditure recovered from the officer who approved the payments.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N116,162,522.60 to some contractors between April and June 2016 without any document. The National Assembly deducted N56,985,568.55 from various contract payments in respect of Withholding Tax and Value Added Tax but without any evidence of remittance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N126,264,320.00 as cash advances to 11 staff members between March and December 2016 to procure goods and services but failed to remit the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly paid N747,286,680.00 as personal advances to staff members between February and December 2016 for various procurements and services but failed to retire the money. The Senate also deducted N118,625,057.48 as Withholding and Value Added Taxes but failed to show any evidence of remittance to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate also spent N109,007,179.73 from the Capital Expenditure vote but without any document.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives reportedly deducted N821,564,296.48 from staff salaries but failed to remit the money to tax authorities.

          "text": "2023: Jonathan yet to get backing from Buhari, APC leaders\n\nBy Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation\n\nInspite of overtures by some Northern governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan to fly the flag of the party in next year\u2019s election, there is no commitment yet from President Muhammadu Buhari or key party leaders on the matter, The Nation can now report.\n\nIt was learnt that the ex-President is still consulting on whether or not to contest or remain a statesman.\n\nJonathan is believed to have lost the backing of some Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors, especially his anointed choice in one of the South-South states.\n\nThe particular governor is said to have ruled out the prospect of another Jonathan presidency under any guise.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to an investigation conducted by our correspondent, the cold shoulder from the PDP governors was capitalised upon by some APC Northern governors to woo Jonathan.\n\nThe APC governors opted for Jonathan because he is only entitled to one term, after which power would return to the North.\n\nIt was gathered that Jonathan\u2019s candidacy is not acceptable to more than three APC governors.\n\nA top source, who spoke in confidence with our correspondent, said: \u201cSome Northern governors have reached out to Jonathan on 2023 presidency and the need to be APC flag bearer.\n\n\u201cThe permutations of the governors border on fostering a North and South-South alliance with some elements in the South-West in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe governors believe that with one term for Jonathan from 2023, the presidency can return to the North in 2027.\n\n\u201cBut many APC governors are not buying into the Jonathan project at all. They claimed that if Jonathan secures APC presidential ticket, there would be no justification for the 2015 ouster of PDP from power by the ruling party.\u201d\n\nFindings from some close associates of Jonathan confirmed that he is interested in the presidency but he wants the ticket on a platter of gold.\n\nThe ex-President is said to have confided in some members of his former cabinet.\n\nA former Minister said: \u201cSo far from interactions with him, the ex-President appears to be interested but he is not convinced of the genuineness of the overtures.\n\n\u201cSome APC governors came to beg him to run for the 2023 presidency on the platform of the party.\n\n\u201cI think the affected APC governors are aware of the fact that Jonathan has lost grounds in PDP. They see him as a big catch to renew the aged alliance between the North and the South-South as was the case during the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThe talks are still ongoing. Jonathan has been awaiting a firm commitment from President Muhammadu Buhari and key APC leaders but this is not forthcoming. His terms are to join APC and get the presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cBuhari, who said he won\u2019t disclose his preferred candidate for 2023 presidential race, sticks to due process and he has not given any green light to Jonathan.\n\n\u201cMany APC stalwarts are also not excited by likely defection of Jonathan from PDP to their party. Apart from his gentle disposition and democratic credentials, they don\u2019t rate him as a political asset.\n\n\u201cBut Jonathan\u2019s aspiration has received the blessing of two former presidents/heads of state.\u201d\n\nInvestigation revealed that Jonathan has been boxed into a corner in PDP by some governors and presidential aspirants.\n\nA party source added: \u201cThe truth is that Jonathan is not finding it easy in PDP. The PDP governors hold the party\u2019s structure and they are not looking towards Jonathan.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Jonathan is no longer enjoying the confidence of PDP governors. He seems to have fallen out with a South-South governor he installed in 2015. The governor has ruled out Jonathan from 2023 presidential race.\n\n\u201cAmong PDP governors, there are presidential aspirants, including Jonathan\u2019s 2010 /2011 chief strategist, Sen. Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Barr. Nyesom Wike (Rivers) and his old foe, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (Sokoto).\n\n\u201cEx-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, whom Jonathan defeated at the presidential primary election in the past, is stronger now than the ex-President.\n\n\u201cThe option left for the ex-President is to take the risk and plunge himself into the race to try his luck.\u201d",

Obasanjo gave the West their share.\n\n\u201cGoodluck gave the Southsouth their share. Buhari is serving the share of the North so it is only natural that 2023 is ours. We are not cognisance of the fact that only a president of Igbo extraction can take us to Aso Rock and not an Igbo president,\u201d he said.\n\nPresenting a paper at the conference as a guest speaker, Rocks Okezie Eze, a Professor of Curriculum Studies and Educational Technology, said Igbos need the support of other regions to get to Aso Villa in 2023.\n\nHe called on the Igbo to shun divisive tendencies and work hard as a group to present their best feet forward instead of fighting whether a suitable candidate can come from Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi , Enugu or Imo.\n\nNdigbo Royal Heritage was founded by Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu, erstwhile leader of the defunct Republic of Biafra. More than a group, NIROH is a divine mandate, established for the redemption of Igbo people of South East Nigeria, whose leadership is bequeathed on individuals nominated through the ancient leadership structure of Igbo located at Nri, the ancestral headquarters of the Igbos.\n\nAlthough NIROH is a mission in progress, it has presently established a presence in most capitals of the world in all the continents, with active members and collaborators.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere is still no light at the end of the tunnel for the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) as factional Caretaker Committee has formally written it to vacate the national secretariat of the party.\n\nChairman of the factional CECPC, Mustapha Audu who made the disclosure in a chat with Daily Sun, however noted that his group will not venture to occupy the secretariat forcefully due to the directive given to urchins to stab them if they dare come to the secretariat.\n\nAsked what happened to the initial threat from the APC Progressives Youth Mandate to occupy the secretariat and audit the Buni-led Caretaker Committee, he said that his faction has not only written them but also commenced the audit process.\n\n\u201cNothing happened to the threat because ours is a mental occupation. We won\u2019t do anything physical and that is why we can\u2019t even protest because we are aware that they have paid those boys outside the APC headquarters to stab people in the crowd when we show up there. It is a ploy to brand us violent people.\n\n\u201cWe know their trap and cannot fall into it. However, we have written to the leadership of the party to vacate the APC headquarters and we are waiting for them to do so. As for the audit, we have started the process.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that Mr President is aware of what we are doing. In fact, it was the DSS that arranged the meeting to be held between us and Mr. President because they know that what we are doing is critical to the survival of the party\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt may surprise you to know that the DSS handled us with civility. I could not believe what they said to me. They said so many positive things. Incidentally, they told them to break into our houses, pick us up in the middle of the night, detain us for three days and then release us.\n\n\u201cBut in their own wisdom, they knew that carrying out their request means to turn Nigerian youths against the security agencies. The DSS advised us that so long as we are not doing anything violently, asking people to commit crimes, we should proceed in what we are doing. They said that since we are fighting for young competent persons to be included in the government, there is nothing wrong with that as far as they are concerned,\u201d he revealed.\n\nMustapha, an aspirant for the 2019 Kogi State governorship poll, warned that his faction is going ahead with the planned February 26 National Convention, even he added that it may still be dependent on the outcome of their meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari and the ability of the Buni-led committee to right their wrongs.\n\nOn whether they are going ahead to conduct APC parallel National Convention in February, he replied: \u201cWe are absolutely going ahead with the convention and February 26 is sacrosanct for it. We are going ahead with it because there is no reason for us to suspend the convention. There has been a series of meetings between us and the DSS and some of the leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that what we did has affected the plans of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee because they were not planning to hold any convention in the first place till July/August this year. They plan to combine the convention with the party primaries for the presidency. There were lots of illegalities going on truncated by our declaration. Our declaration has affected the plans of some of the leaders that don\u2019t have anything good for us,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile expressing readiness and giving conditions to sacrifice his agitations, he said: \u201cIf the right thing is done, I can. Simply, they should call us for dialogue, we want youth inclusiveness and we demanded for 12 out of the 27 national leadership positions. We are asking for vice chairmanship positions, two per geopolitical zone. There is still room for negotiation.\u201d",

          "title": "Sule Lamido exclusive: Beware of APC satanic plot",
          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano\n\nFormer governor of Jigawa State and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sule Lamido is a very blunt personality.\n\nIn this interview, he warned former President Goodluck Jonathan, his long-time political associate, against falling for the satanic overture of the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying it spells nothing but doom. He also throws light on the factors behind the choice of Dr. Iyorchu Ayu as the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nHe also spoke on Obasanjo, Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu.\n\nBesides, he passed his verdict on the Buhari administration, describing it as a grand failure even as he cautions the governors pushing to zone the PDP presidential ticket to the South to consult widely. Excerpt:\n\nWe just had a new leadership in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and as one of the leading chieftains of the party, we would like to have your impressions and expectations?\n\nI must say that asking me to give my impression of the new leadership under Dr Ayu honestly amounts to making me an onlooker of the entire process of his emergence and, therefore, an outsider. Your question is like this: something has emerged and I should give my view about the new development. I think you are not being fair to me. And I think it is inappropriate\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) Okay, let me put it in another way. You were part of the creation of the new leadership of the PDP, what are those factors that informed your choice of the leadership and what do you hope to achieve at the end of the day?\n\nYou see, PDP as a party was founded in 1998 based on some very clear visions in terms of our commitment to take Nigeria to a greater height. In fact, we began with a process of reconciliation and with addressing and curing all those obstacles which were militating against our political progress as a nation at that time. And so, the party was formed and thank God, based on these visions and the vision of the founding fathers. We formed the government for 16 years and there is no human history and administration, which is perfect. PDP is part of human history and which is operating in a very, very peculiar setting called Nigeria. So naturally, there are some problems. We cannot claim to have fulfilled all our wishes or attained all the goals we had set out for ourselves. But one thing is basic. The foundation of our democracy we enjoy today was purely100 per cent the efforts, commitments and thinking of the PDP. And that was why in 1999, even the then candidates from other political parties, were encouraged and designed to come from a particular zone. Because the intention was to reconcile Nigeria. And so, even at that time, the efforts were to bring candidates from a particular geo-political zone which all the parties also, in principle, agreed to. And what we have today, 22 years after, is the bounty of the PDP. It is what I may call the dividends of our efforts in the PDP. There have been some difficulties, there might have been some unfilled or unmet promises, some goals that were defined, but were not properly attained. But on the overall, the PDP laid the foundation of where we are democratically today. And in any case, these are understandable if you have to reckon with the environment called Nigeria. And so after 16 years, we lost power and APC came on board and since then, in spite of their claims of successes, in every sphere of life \u2013 whether it is economy, whether it is security, whether it is infrastructure, they are wobbling and we, Nigerians, are far better off seven years ago than we are today! Whatever are their claims, are you talking of the size of the debts when Jonathan left and what it is today? How many billion dollars are we owing today? When we left, in spite of their blackmail, in spite of their claim that the government of PDP was sponsoring Boko Haram, that it was our own making, we are better off at that time than we are today. In terms of the economy, it is the same story. In terms of the issue of corruption, it is the same thing. So, all their claims, all the claims they have mentioned are falsehood. These are people who had inherited PDP policies which they cannot properly implement. Look at this road between Abuja to Kano, it has been almost the same for the last six years. Look at power, the Mambilla issue. When Buhari came to power, he was abusing PDP. We stole money and that they were going to make sure that it comes into being. Six years into his government, even the road leading to Mambilla, there is no road leading to it. It has not been cleared. The only structure that is there is the structure that Obasanjo put up there in 2002. All their claims are nothing but propaganda and lies and today, Nigerians have come to accept governance as an act of telling lies. So, back to the PDP. In picking the new leadership, we have to ask ourselves. What was our vision in 1999? Where did we go wrong? And where did we derail? And so, we said that we need somebody who have clear knowledge of the background of the party at its formation, somebody who understands what the party was formed to achieve, who is committed and disciplined and patriotic and matured enough to be able to restore the confidence lost in PDP by Nigerians. And the only person who was there at the formation, somebody who is a key player, who believes in partnership, who believes in connectivity, and who believes in taking the entire party as a family and we settled for Ayu. Ayu is that ideal person with a clear head to lead the party at this time. He is the person to restore confidence in the party, unite the party and then give Nigeria the leadership that would convince them to invest their trust in PDP.\n\nYou are a founding father of the PDP and a good population of Nigerians is looking forward to the PDP for leadership of the country. What are those qualities, in your view , that would define the choice of the PDP presidential candidate?\n\nTo me, we need somebody \u2013 North or East, West or South, Muslim or Christians or even pagans or even those who worship irons \u2013 there are enough materials in the party to be used for the presidency. So the first thing now is doing away with those ephemeral things which define the thinking of leadership and governance in Nigeria. Things like he is from my zone, he is from my area, he is from my religion and so forth. We need somebody who is a true Nigerian, not a pretender. Somebody who will be there for Nigeria and somebody whom Nigerians can say yes this is our choice, I know this person and I understand him; somebody who understands the traditions of the country, who understands the culture of the people and who knows the country as an entity. And somebody who is able to give the kind of inspiration and confidence to the younger generation, who are apparently schemed out of anything decent under the present administration \u2013 because they have been abandoned, they have been left out on their own and they have been able to find their bearing on the streets. From the collective psyche of Nigeria, whether it is religious, whether it is economic and whatever, there has been a failure and the younger generation is trying to delink themselves, to find their own bearing. So, we need somebody who will be there to give them the inspiration and confidence. Apart from that, we need somebody who should be able to restore the authority of Nigeria as the leader of the black race. Nigeria is dualizing and, therefore, we need somebody who will be able to stand as a leader of a sovereign independent country known as Nigeria and then as a leader of the black race. Nigeria is the mother and father of the black race. We have 20 million blacks assembled in Nigeria. There is nowhere in the world where you will have this amount of blacks in the same geopolitical setting. Therefore, every black man, either in the Diaspora or here in Nigeria looks up to Nigeria for leadership and for inspiration. So, when we talk of our next leader, it should be somebody who understands that he has an international role to play \u2013 all these agencies. ECOWAS, African Union, United Nations and all other formations, so that we would be able to restore the standing of Nigeria the way we were in the past\u2026.\n\nWhat about somebody who will be able to tackle some of these problems that are pending, that are hydra-headed and we don\u2019t have the solution to deal with them?\n\nYou see those hydra- headed problems that you are talking about cannot be tackled by one person. I mean by the president alone. His is to offer leadership and give guidelines and directions so that the various institutions should stand and work properly \u2013 the bureaucracy, the clerics, the Mallams \u2013 I mean all the institutions in Nigeria must be up and doing the right thing for us to tackle these problems. He should be somebody who will give the right canopy and say you have a role to play for the emergence of a better Nigeria.\n\nA few days ago, it was reported somewhere that some PDP governors were meeting to push for a presidential candidate from the South. What is your take to this move?\n\nWell first, let me say that I am not very sure of this claim. But I read the report that they are meeting and may likely introduce this particular aspect of zoning. With all respect to them, as governors, there was PDP before they became governors. There will be PDP after they leave office. Two, we should be learning from our experiences. If the authority of the office you occupy becomes the determining factor of your political direction and political management, then it means that you are leaving a chuck of people outside. Then it means you are misappropriating their trust. So, I think that ideally, whatever they want to do, they need to consult, they need to know the mood of the country, to know the mood of the members of the PDP who also have right to be part of the process of the decision making they are about to make. I will only advise that whatever they do, they should consult widely, feel the pulse of the country, know the mood of the country and see whether what they say and what they about to do reflect the mood of the country. Sometimes, as governors you are engrossed in your own area of authority and because there, you are the Alpha and Omega, the mood there may be exactly what you want to feel. But if you use that mood to judge the whole country, you may be judging the country very wrongly. There you have total authority. You can say anything you want and the response will be positive. It is the office talking. But after your immediate sphere of influence, there are also others who should be reckoned with, the Nigerian people, the people in PDP, the leaders and also the voters, so you need to read their mood and their feelings and come up with options that align with them.\n\nSir, up till this moment, the PDP has been unable to fully revive itself in Northern Nigeria. Why is it so and what do you think the PDP should do to return to its pre-eminent position in Northern Nigeria?\n\nI think you are not being honest in your question or assessment of the PDP in Northern Nigeria. You are looking at it from your own point of view, your personal judgment. And that is not the correct picture. For you to get a clearer answer to your question, look at Northern Nigeria, how it was six years ago and what it is today. Then you compare and contrast and tell me, which of the North you will prefer. This too will help answer the question on which of the two parties has done better in Northern Nigeria. Our common bond, our unity in diversity, our love for each other as Northerners, they are all gone today. Tragically, they are gone. Under PDP, the region was a united entity within Nigeria. We ensured that the North was secured and supported one another and we made progress in many spheres of life. But see the difference. Look at where we were seven years ago, look at how we are today. Then judge.\n\nI am not talking about an assessment of the performance of the parties. I am talking about the man on the street, either as a result of his error of judgment or not, he seems not to be with the PDP as much as he is with the APC, despite the glaring failings of the Buhari governmen?\n\nApparently, you are trying to create a reality that is not true. But anyway, fine, fair enough. If the man on the street feels that he is okay with the way things are today, let him go along with the APC. If the feeling of the North today is that they are saver, happier, more united, more prosperous and more brotherly, fair enough. Let them have APC all the way to eternity. There is no problem. I have no problem. This is an issue of choice. God has conferred us with the intellect to be able to determine what is right or what is wrong, isn\u2019t it? This is something for you to rationalize for yourself and make your own judgment. There are people who climb the skyscrapers and jump. Are there no people like that? It is their own choice.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan has remained on the radar, he\u2019s like someone who is thinking of coming back to contest the presidency with a view to completing his uncompleted two terms as prescribed by the constitution. We may like to have your take on this. And what advice would you give to him?\n\nWell, the first thing to observe is that here, there are some technicalities. He has been there for six years\u2026 if you are talking that based on the constitution he is coming back to complete his tenure, is he coming for two years to vacate to becoming the vice president for the remaining two years? Answer me? Then, how do you put him there, under an arrangement or under the Constitution? All this swearing in is about eight years. He has done six years and you are now clamouring for him to come and complete the tenure. Is he coming for two years or for four years? Number two. You see when we lost the election and I met him. I met him after we lost the presidency and for the first time, I became a kind of either a preacher, a Mallam, or a pastor in terms of my preaching. And he Jonathan knows what I told him. It is for him to reflect and look at what I said. Because how he became Nigerian president, against all odds, over and above those who have been there in the business before him, is God\u2019s wish and God\u2019s will. Sometimes, you have to go back to your God to be able to remain stable, otherwise you remain insane. If you are not very, very careful, you will miss your metal stability. If he thinks that the people who are calling on him, the people who are clamouring for Jonathan to come to the APC, let him reflect, are they not the same people who had called him names? Were they not the ones? People who are now clamouring for Jonathan in APC? So, if he wants to go, let him go. If he wants to go there, this time around, he is helping himself, not God that is helping him because all other ones (political accomplishments), it was God that was helping him. Now, he is saying that having attained what he is today, let him also use his scheming and his human strength to attain the rest. He is saying, \u201cGod, thank you very much. Go and rest. You have done your own bit. You have made me Nigerian president. I have been there and having been what I am today, I think I can go ahead with what I want\u201d. So there is nothing to say, but to say that I wish him well. But then, he should know that he is coming to face his own party, which made him Nigerian president,which dignified him, which honoured him. He is coming to fight them? I wish him well. He doesn\u2019t know what is called APC? He does not know them? That is the problem. All this ego-caressing\u2026. They are vampires and they are very, very venomous. He has got a name, he has got a reputation which God has blessed him with and it is left for him to protect that reputation. Now, if he wants to aspire for the president, why can\u2019t him come back to his party?\n\nAre you saying that if he comes to aspire under the PDP, you are okay with that?\n\nIf he wants to come back, like the way he became Nigerian president , he will follow the same process of the party. In 2015, when he was there, there were primaries. In 2011, when he won, there were primaries and people ran with him. Let him come and join the race. And these his qualities that are being now promoted by APC \u2013 that he is this , that he is that \u2013 let them all manifest in his own campaign within the PDP umbrella. But for him to begin to rely on the preaching and promises of the enemy who is very, very satanic, an enemy, they say, comes out of your fold, comes to me in fresh and blood so I can confer the presidency on you. He should be very careful. That is all I am saying.\n\nWhat about former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He is still around. His shadow is everywhere for good or as some people say, for bad. What is your take on his un-retiring, endless political presence?\n\nYou see in terms of authority in governance, I must say that he enjoys a total monopoly, because he is a former Head of State of Nigeria. During our civil war, he was an active player. This is somebody who also worked for Nigeria\u2019s transition to democracy. And he fell from grace to grass, in fact, he fell from grace into prison. And by the time, he was in prison, he was able to reflect and know God even better. He was able to look at how God had been merciful onto him because the prison gave him time to go back to God. Sometimes when the ephemeral is pursuing us, when we are after these wordily things, it is only when something happens that we get back to track. So, Obasanjo was very lucky to pass through all of these. And God saved him and he came back. He was Nigeria\u2019s president for eight years. And thereafter, he became an international man, the world over. Everywhere he goes, people respect him. They understand him, they know him and on any issue, they know where he stands. He has no gift of speaking from both sides of the mouth. He speaks from one side of the mouth. And so, if he is still around in the political space of Nigeria, you can\u2019t do anything about that. That is what he is, a political phenomenon. Because he has this total dominance of authority and he is very, very knowledgeable. He knows this country very well, he knows Africa very well and in G77, he was the first Chairman when it was formed. In a number of settings and fora, local and international, he has been their number one. And he is very courageous; he would look at you in your face and tell you the truth. And that is what is called leadership. He has the moral authority to tell you the truth. If today, he, therefore, bestrides Nigeria, dwarfing everybody, it is understandable.\n\nAtiku, too, has been around the political space. He has refused to give up on the presidential project. What is your take?\n\nWhen it comes to aspiration, people have the right to aspire. Atiku has every right to run for the Nigeria\u2019s presidency and he has the right to aspire for as many times as he desires. So, why single him out? Buhari failed how many times before he became Nigeria\u2019s president? Tell me? He contested three times before he became Nigerian president. Atiku is very free to aspire for the topmost position.\n\nBut is Sule Lamido free to aspire and is he aspiring to be president of Nigeria this time around?\n\nHe is very, very free to aspire if he wants to.\n\nIs he aspiring ?\n\nI have been praying very, very hard and I have been saying my God , I beseech you, look on to Nigeria with mercy, see what we have been going through, see our situation. You blessed us with everything, we have human population, the resources, Lord we have got everything, but then we have been vandalizing ourselves. God please give us the best, give us someone who will save Nigeria. I am praying God give us for the best, no matter from where he is coming from, whether North or East, Christian or Muslim, God please give us someone who will save Nigeria, who make Nigeria, that is my prayer.\n\nLooking at the age of some presidential aspirants: Atiku, Sule Lamido , Tinubu and others, they said one of them is not even well. Nigerians are bothered that we are on the path of electing another president who might spend more time tending his health than addressing governance issues?\n\nI am not worried at all because God confers health and, therefore, you cannot vie into the authority of God in terms of his own creation. These are issues which are beyond you. You can talk about the age, bla-bla-bla. If God gives any of them the country, he will give him the health to run the country. This time around, Nigerians are praying very hard. Under APC, we have gone through hell. What we have suffered in the present charge is something else. Once bitten, twice shy. Today, Nigerians are saying God please give us your choice. All along we have been choosing our leaders ourselves, God this time around, we surrender to you, give us your choice. Ignore age!\n\nBut our world is changing. For instance, we have seen President Buhari, on a couple of times, lacking the speed to deal with a number of issues because he belongs to the previous age?\n\nNo, no! When you voted him into power, you knew he was very old. When the people were voting him, they knew he was old and they also knew his own capacity. So, they chose him. Like Obasanjo said recently, he is filled to his brim. He has come to his optimum and there is nothing more or new to offer. It is just like a full cup of water, if you pour any more, it will pour away. No matter what you do, he has reached his maximum capacity. You can\u2019t go beyond your ability. So, why are you complaining?\n\nSix years and half in power and with barely a year plus to go, your assessment of the performance of the Buhari administration?\n\nI have been saying this, that we were in government, we did our best for 16 years. It was not appreciated, we were maligned, we were called names. Boko Haram , they said that it was the making of the government. The issue of subsidy, they said it was a fraud, that it was all lies. So really, we did our best for the 16 years that we were in government. And we were flushed out based on these lies. Now back to your question, I think the best person to answer the question are Nigerians on who this government is working for based on their promises. Nigerians should be able to answer this question. If their answer is yes, that the government is doing very well, they can continue to eternity. You see there are so many wrongs in this administration and the question is which of the wrongs do you even take and discuss? Lack of empathy, lack of integrity, lack of creditability, poverty everywhere, insecurity in the whole of the land, tension and disunity, how do you take it and which do you take? Everything about their performance is woefully wrong! It is in shambles. I can\u2019t mark their script because I don\u2019t know where to start! However, for those who think that they are doing well, for those Nigerians who think that this is what they want, I wish them luck.",

          "title": "Men want to have taste of me because of my sex show \u2013Yinka TNT, singer/presenter",
          "text": "By Tosin Ajirire\n\nSinger, songwriter and presenter, Yinka Ayanda a.k.a Yinka TNT, is frank to a fault. She\u2019s neither pretentious nor flamboyant with words. To her, a spade is simply a spade and shouldn\u2019t be called by any other name.\n\nThe London-based former air hostess at Arik Air is also a matchmaker who continues to make waves with her sexually explicit music and Yinka TNT programme on social media.\n\nAccording to Yinka, what makes her music and Internet programme tick is her being a realist. \u201cNigerians are too hypocritical and sentimental when it comes to sex. I am a realist, I don\u2019t pretend. So, my refusal to call male and female sex organs other names than their real names, and the zeal to liberate people from cultural bondage inspired me to start Yinka TNT programme,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her characteristic frankness, Yinka bared it all in this rare interview. Without mincing words, she opened up on her music, relationship, matchmaking, sex, religion and other issues. Please enjoy it.\n\nYou started with gospel and then metamorphosed to African contemporary music, why did you switch to the kind of St. Janets sexually explicit music you now do?\n\nI started music as a church choir, but professionally, I started music singing African contemporary songs. What informed my sexually explicit music are my belief in reality and hatred for hypocrisy, most especially when it comes to sex.\n\nWhat inspired your sex programme aired on Yinka TNT channel on Facebook/YouTube?\n\nYou will agree with me that we all like to f\u2026k or have sex; I believe penis is penis and breast is breast, so don\u2019t shy away from calling them their real names. No white man would call penis or breast or even virgina any other name. Nigerians are too hypocritical and sentimental when it comes to sex. I am a realist, I don\u2019t pretend. So, my refusal to call male and female sex organs other names than their real names, and the zeal to liberate people from cultural bondage inspired me to start Yinka TNT programme.\n\nYou started music from the church and even rose to become your church\u2019s choir leader. Now, how do we reconcile your religious background with your sex programme on social media?\n\nI became the choir leader at some point when the choirmaster travelled. For me, it was a good experience; it really built my confidence. I am a free thinker now; religion is not for me any more. I have come to realise that having a good relationship with my creator (Olodumare) surpasses any religion.\n\nWhat feedback do you normally get about your sexually explicit music and videos?\n\nI get more positive feedback and constructive criticisms now compared to when I first started.\n\nWith the kind of sex programme you do on social media, have you ever been sexually harassed or had any experience of men wanting to take advantage of you?\n\nI get passes from men on daily basis. They all just want to have a taste of me and see how I practicalise what I present on social media. However, I know how to deal with men, they are boys to me!\n\nHow do Christians and Islamic clerics respond to your sexually explicit music and TV programme?\n\nYou know what pretenders are capable of doing. They watch my programme in the corridors of their bedrooms and come out to criticise me. But I don\u2019t care because I know they are hypocrites.\n\nWhat are the reactions of your husband to your programme?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nI am an entity; to me marriage is not bondage. If I die, I\u2019ll face God and judgment alone, not with my husband. Even if I die on the same day with my husband, he will not be responsible for my deeds before God. I believe marriage should not stop anyone from achieving his or her dreams and aspirations; especially it should not stop me from doing a beneficial programme like mine. It may surprise you to know that some pastors call me \u2018servant of God\u2019 because of the programme I am doing.\n\nTo what extent has your sex programme influenced your children?\n\nMy children are grown up adults and they are very supportive. This is coupled with the fact that we live in the United Kingdom, a civilised environment where people are sex-friendly, where the word \u2018sex\u2019 is not an anathema, and where sex education is being taught in schools.\n\nTell us about your new programme, Shabarikolo. What\u2019s Shabarikolo all about?\n\nShabarikolo means liberation or deliverance, especially for men who are sex staffed in their marriages. When a woman is too secured in her marriage, she sees sex as a luxury. Most times, she claims to be too tired and overwhelmed with daily activities hence her refusal to have sex regularly with her husband. You will agree with me that a tired person needs a helper, so a Shabarikolo will always be there to help such a woman. Widows and divorcees nursing babies will also benefit from Shabarikolo. I\u2019ll rather encourage women in this situation to concentrate more on looking after their children than seeing themselves struggling to keep their relationships, so Shabarikolo will be their best bet.\n\nSome people have accused you of encouraging promiscuity and adultery. How do you react to that?\n\nI think it\u2019s very rude and degrading to accuse me of encouraging promiscuity and adultery. Are the people following me on social media or watching my programme not adults? If some people feel I am encouraging adults to commit adultery, then the adults are vulnerable and lack mental capacity. Therefore, such adults must be put under Mental Health Capacity Act, which means my decision to encourage them to commit promiscuity and adultery is taken in their best interest.\n\nHow do you cope being a student in the UK and also a programme presenter?\n\nI use my time productively and efficiently, which is the bedrock of time management. I prioritize my tasks and ensure I pay attention to details. On school days, I make sure no other work interferes and on work days, no schoolwork.\n\nWhy did you decide to go into matchmaking?\n\nI am a very unusual person; I love to do things that others find difficult. I hope you remember I started as an air hostess and I keep taking up more difficult tasks and Olodumare (God) has always crowned my efforts with successes, including my matchmaking programme.\n\nSo far, what has been the response to your matchmaking programme?\n\nIt has been very encouraging especially with the positive feedbacks I get from the beneficiaries.\n\nWhat has been your experience as a matchmaker?\n\nOh, it has been very rewarding. Most couples that I have brought together through matchmaking have come back to thank me. Some of them would wake me up in the morning and start praying for me. Some will even buy me expensive gifts. Last year, some of these couples that have found joy and happiness in their relationships teamed up with some viewers of my programme to organise a birthday party for me in the UK.\n\nHow do you unwind?\n\nI am a very homely person. When I am not at school, I am at home or work. My favourite part of my home is my bedroom; I rarely go to the living room. I love to write and read when I am not busy with other things. I get bored when I stay too long outside, but I never get tired of my home especially with my family around. I don\u2019t like getting too close to people. I detest problems and hullaballoos, and I am a lover of peace.",

          "title": "Day we made Buhari to panic in Addis Ababa \u2013Gen Hananiya",
          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nAlmost 37 years after he was overthrown by former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in a palace coup, former Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Major General Anthony Haladu Hananiya, has revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari knew that Babangida would overthrow his government.\n\nHananiya who spoke with Sunday Sun as he marked his 80th birthday in Abuja, said that alongside the then Nigerian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, General Joseph Nanven Garba, they informed Buhari who was the military Head of State of plans by Babangida to overthrow him.\n\nHananiya, however, said in spite of the prior information made available to Buhari, he did not take action, probably because he was overwhelmed, a situation that saw the eventual taking over of the government by Babangida.\n\nHananiya also recalled his most trying moment as Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom when the late Umaru Dikko, Nigeria\u2019s erstwhile Minister of Transport who had taken refuge in London following the overthrow of the Shehu Shagari administration, was abducted by the Buhari regime.\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Ethiopia, with concurrent accreditation to Somalia, the defunct Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now African Union (AU), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), opened up on these, his headship of the FRSC during the regime of the late General Sani Abacha and the civilian administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, among other issues.\n\nHow has life been with you?\n\nOh! Wonderful! I give thanks to God Almighty for what He has done in my life and the life of my family.\n\nWhat have you been doing since you left service?\n\nYou know I retired from service in 1987 and I took to farming and I am still doing it. And from farming, I was recalled to come and head the Road Safety (Federal Road Safety Corps) during Abacha\u2019s time and later, during Obasanjo\u2019s administration. So, since I left the Road Safety, I have maintained a low profile.\n\nSo, you are not into private business?\n\nNo, I am not a businessman except farming. And I do this farming to help the community, not really to make profit out of it.\n\nYou are 80. How are you managing old age ailment?\n\nWow! That is a very good question. You should have asked my wife how I am managing it. There are certain foods I want to eat, because of fear that I might be sick as a result of eating some of these foods, they have stopped me from eating them. One of my daughters is a pharmacist and another one is a medical doctor. So, they breed down my neck, they don\u2019t want me to eat all these foods. They said they don\u2019t want me to suffer in old age. Old age in itself is nothing to fear about. But sickness in old age is what people fear.\n\nAt 80, you are at the departure lounge. How do you feel about it?\n\nOh! I am looking forward to it so that I can go and meet my Jesus and leave you people with all the problems of this world.\n\nDo you want to reach 100?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think it is necessary to reach 100. Reaching 100 in good health is one thing. One would not say no, I don\u2019t want. But there are very few people that would reach 100; there are even very few people that would reach 80. So, I am very grateful to God for making it possible for me to reach 80. I don\u2019t want to be a nuisance or a burden to my family.\n\nWhat has life taught you?\n\nTo be tolerant, to love people, to be close to your God and everything will go alright and be well with you.\n\nAny regret at 80?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t have any because I have a wonderful family that has been looking after me very well and I have no regret.\n\nYou headed the Road Safety twice. How was your experience?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nVery challenging! When I first got into Road Safety, I was told to come and reorganise the Road Safety because the Constitutional Assembly of 1983 decided that the Road Safety should be reorganised because at that time, it was only the Yoruba who were controlling the whole Road Safety. They called for the scrapping of Road Safety, but the members of the Constitutional Assembly said no, Road Safety is a very good organisation and what needed to be done was to reorganise it properly so that it would accommodate every tribe in this country. And that was when I was brought in because I never thought of heading Road Safety at all. So, it was a surprise and it was also a challenge.\n\nWhere were you at the time of the appointment?\n\nI have returned from Ethiopia where I was serving as the ambassador. I retired when I was in Ethiopia. I was ambassador in Ethiopia from 1984 to 1987. It was after the coup of 1983. I was commanding One Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna and Buhari was commanding the Three Division in Jos. But they were planning the coup and we were not involved, so as a result, when they took over power, they decided to redeploy most of the senior officers to go abroad on ambassadorial postings. I was sent to London as the high commissioner. It was when I was there that we had the problem of Umaru Dikko.\n\nSo, you were the high commissioner on ground at that time?\n\nI was.\n\nThat must have been a very tough period for you?\n\nOh! It was very, very tough!\n\nHow did you surmount it?\n\nWell, by the grace of God, I did. And when you are honest about everything and you trust your God, everything will go on smoothly.\n\nAnd there was a diplomatic row between both countries?\n\nThere was. But the good thing was that I was in touch with the president directly and Idiagbon. So, it made it very easy for me to know what was going on.\n\nAnd you were recalled eventually?\n\nYes, I was recalled for briefing and then, after that, they said well, I shouldn\u2019t go back to London. So, the Nigerian government said okay, if I can\u2019t go back to London, then the high commissioner in Nigeria must also leave.\n\nAnd they expelled the high commissioner?\n\nYes. They sent him away. So, it was after some few months when I was at the General Assembly in the United Nations that I was appointed the ambassador to Ethiopia for three years. I was still a serving general, but in 1987, I retired from service and came back home.\n\nSo, you were in Ethiopia when Babangida took over the government?\n\nSomehow.\n\nAnd he left you in Ethiopia for some time?\n\nWhen Babangida was preparing to take over the government, I was aware because we had a source of information. I and the late General Garba (Joseph Nanven Garba), he was the Permanent Representative to the United Nations then, he came to Addis Ababa for the annual OAU (the defunct Organisation of African Unity now African Union) meeting. We told Buhari. He came to Ethiopia to attend the meeting as one of the heads of state, that there were some people planning to overthrow you and we told him our source of information was very correct and he should know what to do about it. So, at that time, he panicked. I think he wanted to come back immediately, but I think Idiagbon calmed him down that he shouldn\u2019t; he was going to take control of the whole situation, so he should stay, complete the meeting and then, return home, which he did. And then, after some time when we came in for\u2026 because they used to recall ambassadors for meetings. We had a meeting in Jos and from Jos, we came to Abuja. At that time, Buhari was in Abuja and Vatsa was his minister of the Federal Capital Territory. So, Vatsa organised a meeting between us and Buhari. We the military ambassadors, we went to tell Buhari that well, what we told him about the coup was real because this was the D-day and the hour. So, it appeared he was helpless and didn\u2019t know what to do. We left and went to our various stations. I arrived Ethiopia and four days after, Babangida took over.\n\nWhy do you think Buhari was helpless?\n\nWell, he could have done something to prevent the coup since he knew all the information that he needed to know. But apparently, he didn\u2019t want any bloodshed or struggle, so he just let the thing to go like that. I said okay, if they want to take over the government, let them go ahead. But he was not prepared to allow bloodshed.\n\nAs the high commissioner, you may have played different roles. Do you have any regret over the abduction of Umaru Dikko?\n\nMy only regret was that I was not told the whole story behind the abduction of Umaru Dikko. As the high commissioner, at least, I should have been brought into confidence and be told that this was going to happen. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t tell me that and that is my regret. In fact, I was so annoyed. I had to tell the government then that if they don\u2019t have any confidence in me, why should they send me to embarrass me like that because it was a big embarrassment. When something of that magnitude happens and you are there representing the government, of course, I had to deny knowledge of anything and that my government was not involved. That was my regret that I was not informed on time.",

you recall that we have been very eager to see the use of the Tucano helicopters so that we can have massive engagement with all the bandits.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem was also the status of the bandits and already, you can see that the Nigerian government has declared them as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cSo, the military is now going to do full engagement and we are also getting prepared in the North for such actions.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are expecting so if we are going to take action, let it be massive and such that will ensure that within the first quarter of this year, people will have hope of their security and peaceful living in all parts of the North.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed the need for drastic measures against the bandits and other criminals, saying such actions had become imperative to ensure a conducive environment for farmers to boost food production across the states.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting this action before the next rainy season. You recall we mentioned that we are an agrarian society so, we want our people to go back to farm and, in most cases, it is this insecurity that is keeping them away from the farms,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reiterated that the governors would continue to collaborate with traditional rulers and local vigilantes to safeguard their domains.\n\nMeanwhile, troops of 5 Brigade, Sector 3 Joint Task Force (JTF) of Operation Hadin Kai have killed three terrorists in a market in Damasak, Borno State.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the Nigerian Army said troops clashed with the terrorists in an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said three fighters of the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP) were neutralised in the market during a gun duel.\n\n\u201cTroops, while consolidating on their dogged push to deplete Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province Terrorists (ISWAP) in Borno State, recorded a decisive victory against the terrorists in Damask on Friday, January 7, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops, while conducting clearance operations, code-named Operation Dominance I, came in contact with the terrorists at an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cIn the fierce encounter, three BH/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised, while others, bowing to superior firepower retreated in disarray,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further stated that troops recovered one AK-47 rifle, a truck, two motorcycles, four empty magazines and rounds of 7.62mm ammunition among others.\n\nFG Seeks Divine Intervention to End Security Challenges\n\nIn a related development, the federal government has said that the fight against insecurity and other challenges would need divine intervention.\n\nThe Minister of State for Agriculture, Mr. Mustapha Babai, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the National Prayer Session for Nigeria, organised yesterday by the Kano State Government, said the current administration has been up and doing to overcome the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government had not rested on its oars in supporting security personnel with needed equipment and welfare in a bid to bring the insecurity to an end.\n\n\u201cDespite the support, there is a need to seek divine intervention for the Almighty to bring an end to the challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, for taking the giant spiritual commitment towards making Nigeria peaceful.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with this initiative. Indeed Ganduje is doing well in securing Kano and in giving his quota to achieving peace in the country at large.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, Nigeria is facing security challenges and we are doing our best to support the security personnel. That does not mean we should not seek divine intervention. This prayer session is part of the interventions and I commend the state governor for this,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Ganduje thanked President Buhari for his efforts to ensure Kano remains peaceful by deploying security agents to secure the state.\n\nSaraki Condemns Killing of over 200 in Zamfara\n\nIn another development, former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has condemned the carnage perpetrated by terrorists in Zamfara State, where over 200 people were massacred.\n\nSaraki disclosed that during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis in 2013, he visited the people of Anka Local Government Area of the state, where he met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\nHe lamented that the same vibrant community has become a place of carnage and called for long-lasting solutions to the security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the families and communities that have experienced the tragic loss and injury of loved ones, the destruction of their property, and the interruption of their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cToday, as we all mourn these terrible attacks in both Anka and Bukkuyum LGAs in Zamfara State, we owe the families and all other affected communities across the nation a brighter future.\n\n\u201cIn January 2013, during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis, I spent some time with the people of Anka LGA, Zamfara. There I met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\n\u201cToday, that same vibrant community has become a place of carnage. My heart is heavy, and truly there\u2019s anger too because we cannot continue like this. We must find long-lasting solutions to this insecurity. We will In sha Allah.\n\n\u201cI believe that this brighter future is possible because I have experienced first-hand the desire and enthusiasm that the people in Anka, Bukkuyum, and other similar communities have shown for a better life and a more secure future,\u201d Saraki explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buni-led committee meets Tuesday\n\n\u2022To submit convention schedule to Buhari this week\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFollowing the uncertainty over the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which has tentatively been scheduled for February, a crucial meeting of the governors elected under the platform of the party will hold today to decide whether the exercise will hold or be postponed.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had directed the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State to immediately prepare the timetable for the national convention.\n\nThe Buni-led committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare a schedule for the convention, which will be submitted to the president this week.\n\nAlso, amid the alleged claim that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has zoned its 2023 presidential ticket to the northern part of the country, the main opposition party yesterday restated that it had not zoned the ticket to any zone.\n\nWhile some leaders of the APC such as the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu had urged Buni\u2019s committee to postpone the National Convention to enable the conclusion of the nationwide reconciliation, others, including the Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, had written the party leadership, insisting that shifting the convention would destroy the party.\n\nWith Buhari\u2019s directive that the Buni-led committee should submit clear details of the convention, the committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare the timetable and submit it to the president before Friday.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting of the governors, THISDAY learnt, will set the stage for the emergence of the presidential candidate of the party, the party\u2019s national chairman and the gubernatorial candidates in the states.\n\nA source close to the APC governors told THISDAY yesterday that the governors were divided on the issue of holding the convention next month.\n\nAccording to him, some of the governors wanted the exercise to hold next month to ensure that reconciliations that may arise after the convention are fully addressed before next year\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cSome APC governors are of the view that there is enough time to give 21 days\u2019 notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and hold the convention in February 2022.\n\n\u201cBut other governors argue that the exercise should be postponed because there are crises in the states and the state executives are yet to be inaugurated. These governors are of the view that all the crises should be resolved before the convention,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe source acknowledged that there are over 80 factions of the APC within the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cwe have crises in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Rivers, Kwara, Kano, Lagos, Ogun, Zamfara and other states.\u201d\n\nHe further disclosed that the Ogun State chapter alone has three factions.\n\n\u201cThe crisis rocking the Ogun State chapter of the party is mainly between the group loyal to Senator Ibikunle Amosun, and the faction led by Governor Dapo Abiodun which enjoys the confidence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cThe third group in the state is loyal to former governor Aremo Olusegun Osoba, which isn\u2019t affiliated yet to any of the two mainstream groupings. Lagos State chapter has five factions.\n\n\u201cThe Ekiti State chapter of the party is also embroiled in factional crisis but the matter has become sub-judice, considering that the faction loyal to APC National Leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, is already in court, against the mainstream faction, loyal to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\n\u201cThere are factions in Zamfara State led by former Governor Yari and Senator Marafa on one side and the governor, Mr. Matawalle Bello on the other side.\n\n\u201cWe have a factional crisis in Delta and Anambra States. We also have many pending court cases and some governors believe that all these should be addressed before the National Convention,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe further disclosed that following President Buhari\u2019s directive, the Buni-led committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare the timeline for the convention as requested by the president.\n\n\u201cIf the draft timetable is easily acceptable, a National Executive Committee (NEC) would be summoned and the zoning arrangement would be settled,\u201d the source added.\n\nHe explained that the publicity, venue, accreditation finance and other committees would easily be addressed, adding that \u201call these depend on the outcome of the two meetings on Sunday (today) and Tuesday.\u201d\n\nWe Have Not Zoned Presidential Ticket, PDP Tells Aliyu, Others\n\nMeanwhile, following the alleged claim that the PDP has zoned its 2023 presidential ticket to the northern part of the country, the main opposition party yesterday restated that it had not zoned the ticket to any zone.\n\nA former Governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu was quoted as telling the members of the Atiku Support Organisation on Friday that the PDP had zoned its presidential ticket to the northern part of the country.\n\nAliyu had reportedly told the members of the organisation who visited him in Minna that he was confident of the success of the group, stressing that the party\u2019s decision was a result of the requests of members.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, in a statement issued yesterday, completely debunked the claims.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u20182023: We Have Not Zoned Our Presidential Ticket \u2013PDP,\u2019 the party said: \u201cIts attention has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that our party has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of our party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is a political party founded on democratic principles and every action of the party, including zoning, is based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation, with the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of our nation are reinforced and promoted.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, therefore, urges Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thanks Nigerians across the board for the overwhelming interest they have in our party as their sure platform to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule and urges them to remain united and focused as we join forces for the task ahead,\u201d the statement by Olugunagba explained.\n\nMany northern governors and the 17 southern governors had thrown their weight behind the clamour for power shift to the southern part of the country in 2023 to ensure justice and fair play.\n\nSome of the northern governors include Professor Babagana Zulum (Borno); Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina); Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Samuel Ortom (Benu) and Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), among others.\n\nThe southern governors under the leadership of the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had also, irrespective of political affiliation, given a strong position that power \u201cmust move to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nSince 1999 when democracy returned under this dispensation, former President Olusegun Obasanjo governed from (1999-2007); the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (2007 \u2013 2010); former President Goodluck Jonathan (2010-2015); and President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023).\n\nWith the north completing eight years in 2023, it is expected that power will shift to the south.\n\nHowever, some politicians from the north are working hard to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nTo end the environmental menace occasioned by black soot in Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike, has tasked the state police command to collaborate with other security agencies, council chairmen and traditional rulers to arrest those involved in crude oil theft for prosecution.\n\nThe governor said the illegal bunkering and artisanal refining leading to black soot in the environment was endangering the health of residents of the state.\n\nWike gave the charge at a dinner and award night for officers of the Rivers State Police Command, held at the Police Officers Mess, Port Harcourt.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, Emeka Woke, the governor declared that the state government had resolved to tackle those involved in crude oil theft and refining.\n\nWike stated that the state government was willing to provide the police and other security agencies all that would be required to dislodge and end the activities of artisanal refiners in the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cthe state is prepared to fight them more than ever before.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that since the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Friday Eboka assumed duties last year, Rivers State has witnessed peace and improved policing.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder the crime index in the state has reduced drastically. We thought we are the only people witnessing it, but with the award you got from the wife of the Inspector General of Police, it is an eloquent testimony that what we are seeing as a state, is also being observed from all the nation.\u201d\n\nThe governor said policing in Rivers State has improved remarkably because the management of the Nigeria Police Force at the Force Headquarters and the State Command, respectively distanced themselves from politics.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we will continue to support the security agencies in the state. Our support for security agencies is not only centered on Police Force. We are also extending similar gesture to the Navy, Air force and others.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe the primary function of any responsible government is to protect life and property. So, we have no option than to continue to support in providing logistics and everything that can make the security agencies in the State to function very well.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that if our people are safe and the life here is peaceful, there will be increase in economics activities and the Internally Generated Revenue will also go up.\u201d\n\nWike commended the CP for discharging his duties professionally.\n\nHe, however, announced N1million reward for each of the recipients of the Rivers State Police Command award and N10 million to the command for organising the event.\n\nSpeaking, Commissioner of Police, Eboka explained that 2021 was a remarkable year for the command because Rivers State emerged as one of the most peaceful state in Nigeria.\n\nHe thanked Almighty God for his grace and Inspector General of Police for choosing Rivers State as the venue for the launching of South-South Operation Restore Peace.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis came with the deployment of special forces with sophisticated equipment as well as combat helicopter to the state\u201d.\n\nHe commended Governor Wike for being very phenomenal in the attainment of peace and security in the state.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption of office, the command has received more than 50 patrol vehicles fitted with modern gadgets from the State government. This gesture alone enhanced visibility policing in the state.\n\n\u201cRecall too, when we lost men to miscreants in sometimes April 2021, the governor did not allow us to suffer alone. He wiped the tears of the deceased families with a total sum N220 million, which means each family received the sum of N20 million.\n\n\u201cRecall the #ENDSARS saga. At the end of that saga, which led to the burning down of police stations and vehicles across the nation, the state governor did not abandon us to work under the trees. Rather, the governor constructed a storey building each for the Area Command, Oyigbo and the Divisional Police in Oyigbo.\u201d\n\nThe recipients of the Rivers State Police Command 2021 awards are: G.I.A Godstime Nwuju, best traffic officer; Inspector Winfrey Ini Akpan, best controller; CSP Bako Aghashim, best DPO; CSP Grace Wonwu, best female DPO; and the best visiting tactical team leader went to CSP Adamu.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) generated approximately N938.5 million from fees collected from importers of generators and other internal revenue sources from June 2020 to June\n\n2021, an analysis of the data for the four quarters provided by the industry regulator, has shown.\n\nNERC had in 2013 introduced a N25,000 charge per unit of 100KVA generator imported into the country in its guidelines for obtaining clearance certificate for the importation of generating sets and related matters.\n\nIt also fixed a charge of N3,500 per unit of between 25kva and 100kva generators imported into the country, while generators between 5kva and 25kva attract a charge of N1,000 per unit.\n\nFurthermore, it resolved to begin the collection of N250 per unit of between 2.5kva and 5kva, while between 0.45 Kva and 2.5 Kva generators attract a charge of N150 per unit.\n\nThe amount collected by NERC is exclusive of duties and other taxes paid by the importers in the country.\n\nNigeria still relies largely on generating sets to power its over $400 billion economy.\n\nThe Lagos State government had in October 2021 revealed that as a result of the country\u2019s inefficient and over-centralised electricity supply system, residents of the state alone, generated over 4,500MW daily through the use of generators.\n\nDetails of the financial position of the NERC showed that in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, the IGR from fees arising from the importation of generator sets , licence processing and licencing fee was N431 million.\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that N20.23 million was generated in April, N160.79 million in May and N250.25 million in June of that year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2021, NERC raked in N126.53 million, broken down into N50.80 million, N28.13 million and N47.60 million in January, February and March, respectively.\n\nAn analysis of the last six months of 2020 showed that in the third quarter of 2020, covering July, August and September, the industry regulator made N276.31 million from the same sources, segmented into\n\nN71.10 million, N111.11 million and N94.10 million, in the three months.\n\nSimilarly, in the last three months of 2020, NERC raked in N104.88 million from import fee imposed on the sale of generating sets, among others.\n\nHowever, the total operating levy received from market charges were N4.868 billion for Q2,2021 and N5.061 billion for Q1,2021. Total revenue for the period was N5.299 billion and N5.18 billion respectively, with personnel cost gulping N1 billion and N1.88 billion respectively.\n\nBefore then, in the last six months of 2020, operating levy was N2.64 billion for Q3 and N2.19 billion for Q2, with personnel cost standing at N843 million and N1.17 billion for the two quarters.\n\nBut the commission\u2019s total expenditure profile for the period was N6.1 billion shared into N1.6, N1.0 billion, N2.0 billion and N1.44 billion for the period spanning June 2020 to June 2021.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter under review (Q2,2021), the total revenue realized by the commission was N5.30 billion, about 2.12 per cent higher than the N5.19 billion revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\n\u201cThere was a 230 per cent rise in other internally generated revenue while the operating levy (i.e., market charges) recorded a decline of 3.75 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe higher revenue recorded in 2021/Q2 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the commission stood at N1.44 billion which is lower than the N2.01 billion incurred during the first quarter of 2021,\u201d NERC stated.\n\nFor Q3, 2020, it pointed out that the total revenue that accrued to the commission was N2.93 billion, representing an increase of 31 per cent from the revenue recorded in the second quarter and a decrease of 10 per cent from the revenues recorded in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the improvement in revenues, the commission\u2019s expenditure declined to N1.05 billion in the quarter from N1.36 billion in the second quarter and N1.94billion in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, liabilities also declined to N123 million from N218 million in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe observed decline in expenditure was due largely to the reduction in operating activities of the\n\ncommission as a result of the Covid-19 movement restriction imposed by the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nAs for the summary of the commission\u2019s revenue and expenditure during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, it stated that the total revenue realised by the commission N1 .95 billion, about 33.35 per\n\ncent lower than the revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\nNERC noted that the higher revenue recorded in 2020/Q3 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees, the grant received from Mac-Arthur foundation and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\nNonetheless, it stressed that both the operating levy (i.e., market charges) and other IGR such as licencing fee charged by the commission declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe operating levy and IGR respectively declined by 30.36 per cent and 62.04 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2020. During the some period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the\n\ncommission stood at N1.60 billion which is higher than the N1.05 billion incurred during the third quarter of 2020.\n\nA comparison of the revenue and expenditure of the commission within the fourth quarter of 2020, it stated, indicated lesser expenditure incurred when compared to actual cash receipts.\n\nNERC explained however that there was a positive net cash flow of N347.47 million during the period. \u201cHowever, the total liabilities as at the end of the quarter stood at N419.68million,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Say date in February still possible as 5 disgruntled members beg Abuja court for restraining order\n\n*Party set to deal with recalcitrant followers\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Charles Ajunwa in Lagos\n\nThe Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned an emergency meeting in Abuja tomorrow to pick a date for the party\u2019s National Convention, in line with the advice of President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should put its house in order to avoid being kicked out by the opposition in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who disclosed this yesterday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said \u201cthe party is still hopeful that a date in February is still feasible for the convention\u201d during which new national officers of the party would be elected.\n\nIn a related development, five aggrieved members of the APC have commenced legal action in Abuja, seeking an order to stop the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention. This is the latest in the series of court cases rocking the party.\n\nLalong said the President\u2019s warning to the party that it risks losing power to the opposition, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), was a signal to the APC to have a seamless convention \u201cso that it will not disintegrate.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President\u2019s warning was for the party to redouble its efforts and do the needful.\n\nLalong said: \u201cYou know when convention is coming, there will be fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work,some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re holding the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think during our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to do the convention in February and we are still working on it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own; the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing its own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is about interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong further assured that the meeting scheduled for tomorrow would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping; that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government.\u201d\n\nOn whether the several court cases pending against the party and its leadership will not abort plans of the convention, the governor said: \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party, it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before you go to the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also machineries for resolving court processes, even after convention. I had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC would meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday. Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigation, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that, but I want to assure you that we are meeting. We already sampled the minds of many of the governors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to get a date and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated.\u201d\n\nAggrieved Members Move to Stop Convention\n\nFive aggrieved members of the APC yesterday commenced legal action to stop the planned National Convention of the party by dragging the CECPC, under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, before a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe aggrieved members want the court to issue an order restraining the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nRecall that some members of the APC are clamouring for a change in date of the scheduled national convention.\n\nThe suit dated January 4, 2022, has as plaintiffs, Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as 1-3 defendants in the court processes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court for an order to stop the convention on the grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nLawyer to the plaintiffs, Olusola Ojo raised five questions for the court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nOne of the reliefs included \u201can order of this Court restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nAPC Set to Deal With Erring Members\n\nWith the National Convention of the APC being threatened by a plethora of crises, the ruling party may have resolved to come down hard on some erring members to ensure discipline and position the APC to retain power in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAPC\u2019s planned disciplinary actions are said to be fully supported by President Buhari who wants to leave behind a peaceful and united party in 2023.\n\nAccording to the President, the ruling party would shoot itself in the foot if \u201cit fails to resolve the disunity and lack of agreement amongst members of the party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the decision of the party to sanction some erring members is in tandem with the President\u2019s position to instill discipline within the party.\n\nA source close to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, who preferred anonymity, said the APC was considering \u201cvery serious and severe disciplinary measures against some people whose activities and utterances are threats to the health of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cI can tell you categorically that the party is coming down heavily on some party members whose actions are becoming dangerous for the unity of the party. Some of the individuals involved are high-profile.\n\n\u201cI am aware of two governors that have been pencilled down for disciplinary action. One is from the North-west while the other is from the South-west. The governors are said to be throwing stones at the party through their agents. Also, two former governors who are working against the APC secretly have been identified and will be sanctioned at the appropriate time. Also, some Senators and House of Representatives members are fingered in a secret report at the disposal of the party.\n\n\u201cA minister from the South-east was also said to have been working against the interest of the party. The party may soon unmask these characters and deal decisively with them.\u201d\n\nThe source further said \u201ca meeting will be scheduled shortly to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to insiders at the party\u2019s headquarters, the desperation of some individuals, especially aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the party, and groups within the APC remain a big threat to the peace and stability of the party.\n\nAnother highly ranked member of the party, who does not want his name mentioned, wondered why some aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the APC want to \u201cderail the party at this critical period instead of helping to build it and consolidate on the gains so far achieved by the Buhari government.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere has to be APC first for these aspirants to realise their aspirations. APC is a big family and it has the capacity to accommodate all interests. Buni is working tirelessly to hold the party together and he needs the support of every stakeholder in order to take the party to greater heights. Buni is not contesting for the party\u2019s chairmanship seat. He will be seeking reelection in Yobe State as second term governor.\n\n\u201cSome political parties have predicted that APC will implode. But I have good news for them \u2013 APC will never implode. It\u2019s one united family. We have internal mechanisms we use in settling matters with dispatch. APC is the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a group within the APC called Progressive Initiative For Change and Development has called on the leadership of the APC to ensure all crises in the party are resolved amicably before any National Convention is conducted.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Group, Chief Donatus Okereke told journalists in Abuja that the party was clearly not ready for a National Convention with the crisis engulfing some state chapters, urging the national leaders of the party to ensure \u201cproper and thorough reconciliation\u201d before any National Convention is staged.\n\nPGF DG Calls for Buni\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Director General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Lukman Salihu has called on Buni and the Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe to resign honourably if they can\u2019t conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman stated this in a letter dated January 5, 2022 titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d and addressed to the Chairman of PGF and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\n\nThe director-general also copied President Buhari and key party leaders in the letter which was sighted by THISDAY.\n\nLukman recalled that on Monday, January 3, 2022, he sent an open letter to all APC leaders titled \u201cPlausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u201d, which highlighted some of the reasons the APC National Convention should not be postponed.\n\nThe party chieftain pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that the survival of the party was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the Convention means gambling with the future of the party, which he said was unacceptable.\n\nThe party chieftain said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.\n\nAccording to him, the insinuation in the public is that the reluctance of Buni to proceed with implementation of the decision to hold the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 as agreed was because governors want to continue to control the party, which to the best of my knowledge is not true.\n\nLukman stressed that some commentators both within the party and in the public have argued that there are deliberate efforts to prevent the convention from holding on February 5, 2022, which was why the CECPC did not make any public announcement or begin to make any preparation.\n\nThe director-general said that APC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials of the party in 2023 such that beyond losing the federal government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the electoral prospects of the party simply because of actions or inactions of the CECPC, especially Buni and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, over \u201ctheir failure to probe and to refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N4.1billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly was missing, misappropriated or stolen.\n\nThe suit followed the publication of the annual audited report for 2016 in which the Auditor-General of the Federation raised \u201cconcerns about alleged diversion and misappropriation of public funds and sought the recovery of any missing funds\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, Lawan.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1609/2021 filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking, \u201cAn order of mandamus to direct and compel Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to perform their constitutional oversight functions to promptly probe the allegations that fresh N4.1billion budgeted for the National Assembly may be missing.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that, \u201cThe National Assembly has legal and constitutional duties to prevent and combat corruption, as well as promote transparency and accountability in the management of public resources.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\n\n\"Transparency and accountability in the management of public resources and wealth is essential for promoting development, people\u2019s welfare and well-being, and their access to basic public services, as well as good governance and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the National Assembly to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and to refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies the allegations documented in the annual audited report for 2016 is a fundamental breach of the oversight and public interest duties imposed on the legislative body.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has no legally justifiable reason to refuse to investigate the allegations documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part, \u201cGranting this application would serve the interest of justice, reduce corruption and mismanagement, as well as end impunity of perpetrators, and advance the fundamental human rights of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis suit seeks to vindicate the rule of law, the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability. Government agencies and institutions are responsible to a court of justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that the court is the only judge.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1609/2021 filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja SERAP is seeking an order of mandamus to compel Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to perform their constitutional oversight functions to promptly probe the missing N4.1bn budgeted for the National Assembly. \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) January 9, 2022\n\nSERAP had last year sent a letter to Lawan and Gbajabiamila requesting them to \u201cuse their good offices to urgently probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies allegations that fresh allegations of missing N4.1bn of public money\u201d.\n\nSee Also Corruption Probe Missing N10billion National Assembly Funds, SERAP Tells Nigerian Senate President, House Speaker\n\nThe letter, read in part, \u201cThese fresh allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in the audited reports for 2015, 2017 and 2018 that N4.4billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated or stolen.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen. The National Assembly paid some contractors N417,312,538.79 without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount in question from the contractors.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly reportedly spent N625,000,000.00 through its Constitution Review Committee between March and June 2016 but without any document. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount from the Committee.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly spent N66,713,355.08 as \u2018personnel cost\u2019 but \u2018the payees in the Cashbook did not correspond with those in the bank atatement\u2019.

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, over \u201ctheir failure to probe and to refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N4.1billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly was missing, misappropriated or stolen.\n\nThe suit followed the publication of the annual audited report for 2016 in which the Auditor-General of the Federation raised \u201cconcerns about alleged diversion and misappropriation of public funds and sought the recovery of any missing funds\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, Lawan.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1609/2021 filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking, \u201cAn order of mandamus to direct and compel Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to perform their constitutional oversight functions to promptly probe the allegations that fresh N4.1billion budgeted for the National Assembly may be missing.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that, \u201cThe National Assembly has legal and constitutional duties to prevent and combat corruption, as well as promote transparency and accountability in the management of public resources.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\n\n\"Transparency and accountability in the management of public resources and wealth is essential for promoting development, people\u2019s welfare and well-being, and their access to basic public services, as well as good governance and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the National Assembly to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and to refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies the allegations documented in the annual audited report for 2016 is a fundamental breach of the oversight and public interest duties imposed on the legislative body.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has no legally justifiable reason to refuse to investigate the allegations documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part, \u201cGranting this application would serve the interest of justice, reduce corruption and mismanagement, as well as end impunity of perpetrators, and advance the fundamental human rights of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis suit seeks to vindicate the rule of law, the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability. Government agencies and institutions are responsible to a court of justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that the court is the only judge.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1609/2021 filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja SERAP is seeking an order of mandamus to compel Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to perform their constitutional oversight functions to promptly probe the missing N4.1bn budgeted for the National Assembly. \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) January 9, 2022\n\nSERAP had last year sent a letter to Lawan and Gbajabiamila requesting them to \u201cuse their good offices to urgently probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies allegations that fresh allegations of missing N4.1bn of public money\u201d.\n\nSee Also Corruption Probe Missing N10billion National Assembly Funds, SERAP Tells Nigerian Senate President, House Speaker\n\nThe letter, read in part, \u201cThese fresh allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in the audited reports for 2015, 2017 and 2018 that N4.4billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated or stolen.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen. The National Assembly paid some contractors N417,312,538.79 without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount in question from the contractors.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly reportedly spent N625,000,000.00 through its Constitution Review Committee between March and June 2016 but without any document. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount from the Committee.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly spent N66,713,355.08 as \u2018personnel cost\u2019 but \u2018the payees in the Cashbook did not correspond with those in the bank atatement\u2019. The Auditor-General wants \u2018the irregular expenditure recovered from the officer who approved the payments.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N116,162,522.60 to some contractors between April and June, 2016 without any document.

A.B Akali (retd) from Adamawa State, is not different from the aide of President Buhari, Lauretta Onochie, who was nominated but public outcry led to her rejection by the Senate.\n\n\n\nThe second nominee for North-East Dr Baba Billa (Yobe), is a friend and ally of Governor Buni, who nominated him.\n\n\n\nAGF Malami facilitated and ensured that one Dr Sani Mohammad from Plateau State whose nomination was stood down on the grounds of his dismissal from University of Jos for gross misconduct and alleged sexual harassment.\n\nDespite such questionable past, Malami ensured that he scaled through Senate overnight and he is today one of the stooges planted in lNEC as a national commissioner.\n\n\n\nIn the North-Central, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, INEC Chairman, on his list of request wanted Prof Taye Simbine whose tenure ended after the 2019 election but other forces ensured Mohammed Haruna secured second term despite not healthy and strong enough to cope with the rigours of the INEC job.\n\n\n\nIn the South-West, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti was responsible for the Resident Electoral Commissioners and the commissioner elevated from the state.\n\n\n\nIn the South-East, Festus Okoye's tenure still subsists.\n\n\n\nHowever, Prof Okechukwu Obinna lbeanu, who was the National Commissioner in charge of Electoral Operations of INEC, was denied a second term because of Anambra election that he declined all entreaties by APC\u2019S Andy Uba\u2019s group to have the election compromised.\n\n\n\nIn the South-South, pro-politician commissioners whose position on any issues are not known and who are considered write-offs in the event of consequential situations were nominated.\n\n\n\nThe national commissioner nominee from Bayelsa State, Prof Rada Gumus, was selected by Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipreye Silva.\n\n\n\nRecall that Silva also nominated Prof Braibafah as managing director of NDDC and was disgraced from office over corruption but the matter was swept under the carpet without prosecution till date.",
          "summary": "Some political bigwigs in the ruling All Progressives Congress have started perfecting their plot of manipulating the party\u2019s primaries and 2023 general elections by nominating proxies to President Muhammadu Buhari to be made electoral commissioners, SaharaReporters has gathered.\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the stooges planted by the cabals in the country's electoral agency, the Independent National Electoral Commission, had already been approved by Buhari, who was not diligent to be aware of the grand plot to manipulate the electoral process.\n\"In their calculation, if the plans they have in place for the party convention and party primaries lead to fragmentation, they need to have buffers.\nIn the South-West, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti was responsible for the Resident Electoral Commissioners and the commissioner elevated from the state.\nRecall that Silva also nominated Prof Braibafah as managing director of NDDC and was disgraced from office over corruption but the matter was swept under the carpet without prosecution till date.",

          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\n2022 predictions for the fintech industry\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Clubhouse-like platform\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2m fund\n\nWhat does 2022 hold for the fintech industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, Africa has seen rapid growth in the fintech industry. In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State.

Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

          "title": "2023: Dave Umahi and his politics of pettiness",
          "text": "By Obi Nwa Uballa\n\nHaving eaten too much while the rest of Ebonyi people \u2013 including civil servants who are poorly remunerated \u2013 almost starved, Dave Umahi, governor of the state, will leave office in 2023 with protruding stomach as one of the legacies of his eight-year stewardship in the state. Umahi, today, has a big stomach, and already sees himself as a very big man. Back in the day when we were kids, a big man was a man who had a very big tummy. It was for us, the only clear evidence that a man had arrived. And Umahi who, perhaps, still has such idea that a man\u2019s \u2018bigness\u2018 can be measured by the size of his belly, apparently looks himself, every now and then, in the mirror, and concludes that, \u2018Yes, I have to be the biggest man around now in Igbo land,\u2019 which could be why he has also developed a very fragile ego.\n\nNo doubt, a governor is as big as it gets, and of course, big men often have big ego, especially those who stumbled on wealth. It\u2019s not strange, therefore, that Umahi has become very touchy. In Ebonyi where he reigns much like an emperor, he brooks no opposition, and not even criticisms are allowed. And if anyone is unwise to sing what is not music to his ears, they should be ready to receive the police as guests and made to face some very ridiculous charges in court. A certain Chief Abia Onyike, a former commissioner for information in the state, knows this too well, and so do journalists who have dared to write what he considers unfavorable report.\n\nWhen in late 2020, Umahi decided that in the interest of his presidential ambition, he should defect to the ruling APC, having perhaps realised that with people like his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, he may not have his way in the PDP, he expected every Ebonyi stakeholder to scurry up to him in his new party and quickly pledge allegiance. So, when this did not happen, Umahi declared war on everyone, including former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim. Talk about nza, the tiny bird who forgot himself after a heavy meal and challenged his chi to a fight.\n\nUmahi imagines that he must have everything his way, and that everyone must queue behind him and defer to him or he raises hell. He must dictate to everyone, even to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and if the apex Igbo sociocultural group is rash enough to suspend his man for gross indiscretion, Umahi will throw tantrums, for how can Ohanaeze not bow at the feet of a man who is now so big that there cannot be any doubt about his position as the supreme leader of Ndigbo?\n\nBut it\u2019s obvious that Umahi is deluded. No doubt, he has built infrastructure in Ebonyi \u2013 even if there are controversies about whether he uses his companies or whether he is claiming ownership of structures built with state resources \u2013 but building infrastructure in Ebonyi cannot automatically make one a presidential material. One has to have pedigree, and that cannot be gotten by developing a fragile ego and turning oneself into an emperor in the little space one governs. Unfortunately, Umahi has a very exaggerated idea about his self worth and this is becoming a big problem, not just to him, but to Ndigbo and their quest to produce the country\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nHistorically, the greatest challenge Ndigbo have faced in their quest for relevance in national politics, is that everyone wants to be number one, even when they have no chance of getting anywhere. And if they cannot be, then nobody else should. We\u2019ve seen the \u2018pull him down syndrome\u2019 play out time and time again, and clearly that\u2019s what Umahi has resorted as it\u2019s becoming clear that Pius Anyim will be the candidate to beat in 2023.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor, having seen the amount of support the former senate president is getting among the Igbo in his quest to be president, has gone extreme with his childish tantrums. It\u2019s amazing how an individual will grow into an adult, but his brain still functions like that of an infant. After Igbo PDP stakeholders met in Enugu on Thursday and endorsed Anyim\u2019s presidential bid, Umahi\u2019s hireling who run a Facebook page, Ebonyi Online, through which they pour invective on Anyim, posted a press release issued by one faceless group probably working at his behest asking that the likes Adolphus Wabara, former senate president and Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader, who had at different fora endorsed him, withdraw such endorsement.\n\nThe group which identified itself as South East Democratic Civil Society Coalition (SEDSOC), in the press statement signed by a certain Chief Willy Ezugwu \u2013 apparently the new chief of fifth columnist in the Southeast \u2013 had argued rather unintelligently, that Anyim\u2019s endorsement is \u201chasty and self serving,\u201d as according to them, \u201cThe South East has eminently qualified persons capable of transforming Nigeria if given the chance by the electorate to serve as President in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe eminently qualified persons spoken about by the group of jobbers must, of course, include the likes of Umahi. Such a laughable display of lunacy. But they would soon take the insanity notches higher. Late last week, hired thugs went to destroy a statue of Anyim in his hometown, an insane action gleefully shared by handlers of the same pro Umahi facebook page, Ebonyi Online, as evidence that the former SGF has been rejected in his own homeland. Ebonyi, by the way, has become a volatile state, with armed thugs unleashing mayhem on both perceived and real opponents of the powers that be. Indeed, the whole show would have been hilarious, if not that it has continued to manifest, sometimes, in very brutal attacks on such opponents, even as it has the potential to constitute a serious dent on the quest for Igbo president in 2023.\n\nSadly, it\u2019s been the case in the past and Umahi is not attempting anything new. Time and time again, when there is need for the Igbo to rally and demand for power, little minds will emerge from everywhere to throw spanner in the works. In 2003, when the quest for Igbo president of Nigeria was crystallising, many wanted to contest, even when it was obvious that the late former vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, was clearly the best candidate and the only person with enough political clout to win. It didn\u2019t matter, they simply wanted to run against him, spurred on by their ego and pettiness, and some perhaps to injure his chances for a mess of pottage. Of course, a combination factors ultimately ensured that Ekwueme lost out, once again, to Olusegun Obasanjo, the then president who had emerged PDP candidate and eventually president after Ekwueme was outmanoeuvred at the Jos convention in 1998. 2003, the last time Ekwueme contested, would be the last the Igbo credibly challenged for power at the centre. Subsequently, others, mostly flyweights, contested as \u2018also runs.\u2019\n\nAgain, ahead of 2023, easily the most critical year in the modern political history of Ndigbo, when their quest for power will be both a quest for equity and justice, as well as a moral responsibility on Nigeria, the trait is emerging even before the real battle starts. While it is clear to everyone that Senator Anyim, and perhaps, former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, are the two individuals with the necessary reach and political leverage to credibly challenge for power in Abuja, particularly within the PDP, every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to run. But this is not the problem. There is nothing wrong with anyone from anywhere wanting to be president. Indeed, competition for power is the hallmark of democracy, and in every zone of Nigeria, people have competed and continues compete with one another. In the Southwest for instance, the likes of Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Kayode Fayemi, among others, are working hard to garner the support of their people and the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, apart from the fact that the Southeast, given its historical disadvantage, can ill-afford this sort of \u2018sibling rivalry,\u2019 what is remarkably different is that as opposed to promoting themselves, the clowns that dot the political landscape of the zone, resort to pulling down those ahead of them, which is what makes the Umahi scenario in Ebonyi particularly painful. Granted that the Ebonyi governor has the right to seek to be president, even if he has no chance of winning, but every sane Igbo person who wants power should focus on promoting himself at this stage, and not dwell on attacking another who is doing so.\n\nIt is particularly surprising that people who are not in the PDP want to poke their noses into the affairs of the party in the Southeast, and dictate to stakeholders who to endorse and who not to endorse. The obsession is simply incomprehensible. Sadly, while the little minds are focused on pulling their own champions down, they are travelling to Abuja with bags of money to feed others hoping that they\u2019d be favoured by those who presumably hold the levers of power in the country. But they have no idea. A man who helps to destroy his own warrior on account of petty envy or just utter myopia, has only made himself weak and vulnerable, and cannot be trusted by his rival. Umahi should be reminded that where he is headed there is no road. At the end day, he would make mockery of himself and destroy his own political career.\n\nObi Nwa Uballa, a concerned South Easterner wrote from Lagos State.

          "text": "Lukman Otunuga\n\nStock markets are limping into Thursday\u2019s session in a frightened state after the minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting pointed to a faster than expected hike in interest rates.\n\nAsian stocks flashed red this morning following the heavy selloff on Wall Street overnight as hawkish signals from the FOMC minutes and spread of the Omicron variant sapped investor confidence. Gold has also found itself under pressure with prices struggling to keep above the psychological $1800 support level. In the FX space, the dollar appreciated as US Treasury yields jumped after the meeting minutes were released.\n\nGiven the market reaction to a more hawkish Fed, global equities certainly remain highly sensitive to increased rate hike expectations. With the US December jobs report around the corner, the atmosphere across the board could become tense and nervy as investors adopt a cautious stance. Whatever the outcome on Friday, the first trading week of 2022 has already kicked off with a bang.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the US non-farm payrolls\n\nAll eyes are now firmly focused on December\u2019s US jobs report which will be released on Friday. The pending data will be heavily scrutinised by investors for key insight into the health of the US labour market and wage growth.\n\nYesterday, the ADP Employment Report revealed that private sector employment surged by 807,000 in December. This figure smashed market forecasts and was a big jump from the 505,000 witnessed in November. Even though the ADP data is a poor predictor of the key non-farm payrolls report on Friday, markets may be readying themselves for a potential upbeat number. Consensus expects 425,000 jobs to have been created by the US economy last month, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1% from 4.2%.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the US jobs report is being released at a time when the Fed has signaled interest rate hikes may be more aggressive than expected, amid concerns over soaring inflation. The March Fed meeting is now very much \u201clive\u201d with an 80% chance of an interest rate hike. The general consensus at the Fed also appears to be emerging that the maximum employment goal is now within reach, so NFP may play a big part in validating this thinking.\n\nShould the jobs report exceed market expectations, this is likely to boost confidence in the US economy and reinforce expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates in the Spring. Such a development may result in a stronger dollar while pressuring equity bulls and gold further. Alternatively, a massive payroll miss similar to November may raise questions over the health of the US economy and the Fed\u2019s ability to aggressively raise rates.\n\nCommodity spotlight \u2013 Gold\n\nA stronger dollar, hawkish Federal Reserve, and rising treasury yields make a poisonous cocktail for gold. The precious metal is under pressure on the daily charts with prices struggling to keep above $1800 as of writing.\n\nWhere the precious metal closes the week is likely to be heavily influenced by the key US jobs data on Friday. A strong report could cripple gold bugs, opening a path lower towards $1786 and $1770. Should $1800 prove to be reliable support, prices may rebound back towards the $1810 and $1831.\n\nLukman Otunuga is a Senior Research Analyst at FXTM\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "How Aiteo, Nigerian regulators misreported Nembe oil spill that caused severe environmental damage",
          "text": "The November 2021 oil spill in Nembe, Bayelsa State, started at least three days earlier than the owner of the well and the federal government publicly acknowledged, a PREMIUM TIMES investigation has found.\n\nThe spill, one of Nigeria\u2019s worst in recent years, lasted more than a month and caused extensive environmental damage with more than a hundred thousand barrels of oil spewed into the environment, according to expert estimates.\n\nOur review of the disaster has shown that oil and gas fumes from a wellhead operated by the Nigerian firm, Aiteo, caused large scale destruction of aquatic lives and damaged water bodies and farms. Residents have also reported health problems after the incident occurred.\n\nAiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company, the operator of the well said it \u201creported\u201d the spill on November 5, and the Federal Ministry of Environment said the incident started November 5.\n\n\u201cAiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), Operator of the NNPC /Aiteo Joint Venture of Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29 on Friday, 5 November 2021, reported a hydrocarbon well head leak in its Santa Barbara, Southwest field, in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State,\u201d the company said in a statement on November 22.\n\nIt added: \u201cImmediately upon noticing the leak, Aiteo notified all relevant regulatory agencies and thereafter mobilized containment resources to limit impact on the environment. As required, Aiteo promptly called for a Joint Inspection Visit (JIV). Due to the high-pressure effusion, the JIV team could not reach the location and that inspection was aborted.\u201d\n\nThe environment ministry, which is the regulatory ministry, was more categorical: \u201cIt can be recalled that the spill occurred on Nov. 5, 2021, in a form of fountain within the proximity of Opu Nembe Community at Well 1, Wellhead located at the Southern Field of Sant Barbara,\u201d it said in a statement by Saghir el Mohammed, its press director, on November 23.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report of the incident, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) comprising the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) and Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), was set up,\u201d the government added.\n\nBut PREMIUM TIMES has learned from witnesses and local officials that the blowout occurred days earlier, and the firm and the regulator were informed before the date they announced. They only began to take action on November 5.\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe law requires that companies report and respond to spills within 24 hours of learning about them. Failure to do so attracts daily fines for the duration of the delay. Because the fines are dismal \u2014 N500,000 a day \u2014 activists say oil companies sometimes feel no urgency to respond until the situation attracts public attention.\n\nThey also said that while Aiteo merely said it \u201creported\u201d the incident on November 5, the government\u2019s outright declaration that the spill took place November 5 means it believed Aiteo had met the requirements of the law.\n\n\u201cThe spill was observed by Aiteo surveillance team on 4th November and confirmed by Aiteo operations team @ about 730Hrs on 5th November, 2021. It was reported to the Commission on Friday 5th, which was within the 24-hour limit stipulated by law,\u201d the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission told PREMIUM TIMES in a message on Friday.\n\nThe director general of NOSDRA, Idris Musa, also told PREMIUM TIMES the spill began on November 4 and Aiteo reported on November 5. Aiteo did not respond to our calls and messages.\n\nBut several witnesses, including fishermen and security personnel who witnessed the start of the spill, said the incident occurred on November 1 \u2014 controverting both the operating firm, Aiteo, and the government.\n\n\u201cThe spill started on November 1 and the community members reported to us on November 2, the same day we escalated it to NOSDRA,\u201d said Mike Karikpo, the Director of Programmes at Environmental Rights Action, the Nigerian chapter of Friends of the Earth International.\n\nDevastating Spill\n\nRotten, discoloured, and mired in sticky crude oil, the fish and crab carcasses Nengi James kept in an old refrigerator in his modest Bayelsa bungalow were causing an overpowering stench as he brought them out a late afternoon in December.\n\nMr James, a veteran of the Niger Delta environmental and resource justice struggle at the height of the oil-rich region\u2019s crisis, had picked the animals dead and washed up from parts of Nembe creeks and the Santa Barbara River. The waters are now blighted by sheens and patches of oil, darkened and grey-brown at different parts.\n\n\u24d8In addition to the animals, Mr James also collected polluted water samples using bottles aboard a boat sailing across the river, which meanders through the Delta area and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe deaths of the aquatic lives followed the oil spill at the OML 29 Well 1 platform \u2013 an active but for long, a non-producing installation at Worikumakiri in the Santa Barbara River, Nembe area of Bayelsa State \u2013 operated by Nigeria\u2019s largest domestic oil firm, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company.Owned by billionaire businessman Benedict Peters, reported in the Pandora Papers to have allegedly bribed fugitive former Nigerian oil minister Alison Diezani-Madueke for favours, Aiteo acquired OML 29 and the Nembe Creek Trunk Line from Royal Dutch Shell in 2015 in a deal that Shell said was worth $1.7 billion. (Mr. Peters has denied bribery allegations.)\n\nOML 29 stretches over an area of 983 square kilometres, producing 43 thousand barrels per day in 2014, and the Nembe Creeks Trunk Line is 100 kilometres long with a capacity of 600 thousand barrels per day, according to Shell. It is a \u201clarge\u201d block and also contains \u201csignificant associated gas volumes,\u201d the natural resources research and consultancy firm, Wood Mackenzie says.\n\nIn Nigeria, oil blocks are joint ventures, JVs, involving the state-owned NNPC and exploration and production companies like Shell, ExonMobil, Total and Chevron, who are the operators. There are also domestic players like Aiteo.\n\nAiteo and Shell are now locked in legal disputes initiated by the former, claiming the Dutch multinational made false claims about the ownership and conditions of the assets and seeking billions of dollars in damages.\n\nDue to the degraded conditions of oil and gas facilities amid a weak regulatory system and unwholesome corporate sustainability practices, as well as vandalism by oil thieves and militants, the Niger Delta has suffered debilitating effects of environmental pollution for decades.\n\nThis has fuelled widespread poverty and discontent in a region where rural populations, who barely benefit from its oil and gas wealth, depend on the environment for livelihood, mostly as fishers and farmers.\n\nQuestionable Disclosure\n\nEstablishing the actual date the spill began is important for a number of reasons, activists and analysts say. First, it is a measure of demonstration of transparency by oil companies that are often accused of misreporting and downplaying spills, and by regulators that regularly face allegations of bias against local communities.\n\nIt also puts a spotlight on the well-acknowledged challenge of regulators having to largely rely on companies for information on oil pollution in the Niger Delta.\n\nResidents of Nembe said for at least 38 days, beginning November 1, the Aiteo Santa Barbara wellhead relentlessly spewed crude oil and associated gas from two points into the creeks and Santa Barbara River, which serves more than 50 fishing communities in Nembe. As the wellhead spurted oil into the mangroves, tides transported the liquid to the land lying on the edges of the river, devastating farmlands.\n\n\u24d8\n\n\u201cEverything is destroyed,\u201d said Kellcy Ayebaemi, fisherman and youth leader for the Nembe riverine communities. \u201cCassava, plantain, palm trees \u2013 all have gone.\u201d\n\nFishers and local officials in the area, including a security operative contracted to protect the wellhead at Worikumakiri, said the blowout happened on November 1.\n\n\u201cIt was 4:30 AM on November 1 that the explosion happened,\u201d Mr. Ayebaemi said. \u201cWe just heard \u2018boom\u2019.\u201d He said the night became bright from the glow of the ferociously spitting wellhead and farther away smoke filled the air.\n\nThe witnesses said company officials visited the facility using a speed boat during the daytime on the same November 1 the wellhead exploded.\n\n\u201cBut the company did nothing and only came back on November 5 to start containment and recovery of crude oil,\u201d said Mr. Ayebaemi. \u201cNormally, they should have acted immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the regulators are weak,\u201d said Bassey Udo, founder of the business-focused website, Mediatracnet. \u201cThey depend on oil companies for information on incidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it is offshore, the companies use their helicopter or speed boats to give the regulators access. So, companies only grant access to information they want the regulators to know,\u201d said Mr Udo, who has reported the Nigerian oil industry for over 20 years.\n\nAnd when the response did start on November 5, efforts were focused on containment of the crude oil flowing through the channel leading to the wellhead. The oil spurting far and into the mangroves could not be contained, witnesses said, explaining the widespread pollution of the water, the mangroves, and the surrounding land.\n\nWritten questions to Aiteo and phone calls to spokesperson Mathew Ndiana-Abasi were not answered. NUPRC did not also honour a request for comment made via written questions to spokesperson Paul Osuh.\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES interviewed Mr James before regulatory officials disclosed the \u201ccause\u201d of the spill, he predicted that NOSDRA and NUPRC would blame sabotage by residents in order to absolve Aiteo of blame.\n\n\u201cNOSDRA has no boat or helicopter, companies take them to offshore sites. They cannot detect or determine anything on their own; so, the government will back Aiteo or any company. They will both say it is sabotage,\u201d Mr James said, foretelling the position Nigerian regulators would take.\n\nEventually, officials from NOSDRA and NUPRC attributed the spill to sabotage following a controversial late December Joint Investigative Visit, JIV, which is a statutory probe involving regulators, operators, the state government, and the impacted communities.\n\nIsmail Baba-Hammed and Adetoyibo Adeyemi, respectively officials of NOSDRA and NUPRC on the JIV, said only vandalism could have caused the blowout, arguing that the pressure from the oil well was not sufficient to cause the wellhead to blow. Citing engineers that helped Aiteo plug the wellhead, the former particularly said the wellhead casing was removed, not worn out, stressing sabotage.\n\nThe Nigerian military has blocked access to the malfunctioned wellhead and the surrounding impacted riverine communities, barring activists and journalists from the area. Only those sanctioned by the government or the company can visit the site.\n\nApart from the military at the Santa Barbara River area, Aiteo has a contracted private security outfit dedicated to the protection of the wellhead. One of the security operatives told PREMIUM TIMES, before the regulatory officials spoke, that the wellhead had not been vandalised and the explosion was sudden. PREMIUM TIMES could not independently confirm that.\n\nHistory of Spills\n\nBayelsa State, which holds no real powers in Nigeria\u2019s natural resource governance system that vests control of all oil and solid minerals in the federal government, faulted the regulators\u2019 position.\n\nBoth parties barely cooperated during the JIV. An initial probe visit was marred after Bayelsa State insisted on including the press to \u201censure transparency\u201d, a position Aiteo officials opposed.\n\n\u201cThis is terribly sad and unfortunate given the fact that NOSDRA and NUPRC are supposed to be regulators and as such should be unbiased and act at all times with integrity,\u201d Biriyai Dambo, who is Bayelsa\u2019s Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, as well as chair of the technical committee on the spill, said in a statement. \u201cFinally, the Government of Bayelsa State completely rejects the JIV of Wednesday, December 22, 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that NOSDRA and NUPRC are biased and are playing a script in cahoots with AITEO.\u201d\n\nFaulting the procedure followed in arriving at the position that the spill was caused by vandalism, Mr Dambo said the components and accessories of the wellhead that were to be inspected had been removed and replaced, which amounted to tampering with and concealing the equipment and evidence.\n\nResidents said two \u201cminor\u201d spills had happened from the same wellhead in 2018 and 2019. \u201cThose ones happened without any response,\u201d said Moses Ayarite, a Nembe youth leader.\n\nOf the previous spills, Mr Dambo said requests by the affected communities to remediate their environment were rebuffed by Aiteo.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked to note that on the day of this latest JIV, when asked about these previous incidents at the exact same wellhead, AITEO denied and NOSDRA kept silent,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the course of the JIV, the behaviour and utterances of representatives of NOSDRA and NUPRC called into question their independence and neutrality.\u201d\n\nMr Dambo maintained that the position of Bayelsa government is that the cause of the spill was equipment failure and that it would take all appropriate steps to pursue environmental justice for itself and the affected communities.\n\nHe said such redress would put an end to the perennial pollution of the environment through \u201creckless and irresponsible oilfield practice that is condoned by a weak or compromised regulatory system.\u201d\n\n\u201cFraudulent misrepresentations\u201d\n\nWhile the cause of the spill continues to stir controversy, what is clear is that the infrastructure was active but non-producing, and was not decommissioned either by Shell before divesting or Aiteo after acquisition.\n\n\u201cThere are regulatory matters guiding assets that are not in use or non-producing. When they are not in use or not connected to pipelines but active, there is a risk of exposure to pressure. So, they need to be temporarily or permanently abandoned and decommissioned for safety but that did not happen in the case of Nembe and that was why the spill happened,\u201d an oil engineer, who is familiar with the OML 29 facilities but sought not to be identified by name, said.\n\n\u201cMany times the multinationals divesting (from) assets in the Niger Delta are leaving near-dead, degraded assets for local businesses without a proper decommissioning programme and the regulatory system is too weak to ensure that is done either before divestment or after an acquisition to keep the environment and people safe.\u201d\n\nExperts worry about the state of the wellhead before the blowout especially given that Aiteo itself is in court demanding damages and claiming Shell had made \u201cfraudulent misrepresentations\u201d about the Nembe Creek Trunk Line, sold alongside OML 29. Aiteo says the trunkline was in a more degraded condition than advertised by Shell.\n\nThe oil engineer suggested that Aiteo may consider legal actions to push blame to Shell if it becomes apparent it would pay compensations to affected communities or bear heavy cleanup costs.\n\nNo preparedness for spill emergency\n\nBesides its delayed reporting, Aiteo has also been criticised for its state of preparedness for spill emergencies.\n\nThe company only succeeded in late November in calling in Halliburton\u2019s Boots and Coots to deal with the spill that was apparently beyond its capacity.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings showed that although there is no law compelling companies to do so, many corporations have plans in place in anticipation of spill emergencies. One common way is to subscribe to Oil Spill Response Limited, OSRL, of Southampton in the United Kingdom, an industry-funded cooperative for spill preparedness and response.\n\nOSRL has among its shareholders, called participant members, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, Petrobas, and Total, among others. According to information on its website, OSRL also allows \u201cassociate members\u201d with a joining fee of 6,500 British pounds and annual subscription rates between 34,433 pounds and 275,466 pounds depending on the volume of production and number of sites.\n\nOSRL promises a \u201cready\u201d and \u201cseamless\u201d spill response. Its associate membership is open to non-shareholding firms and companies like Aiteo could subscribe. A list of its associate members includes Oriental Energy Resources Limited and Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, two Nigerian companies among scores of others based in several countries.\n\n\u201cAiteo does not have the technical capability to respond to the spill and also does not have a subscription with OSRL, which could have mobilised an immediate response action,\u201d a senior regulatory official told PREMIUM TIMES, asking not to be identified by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequence of lacking preparedness by Aiteo was that it had to start looking for experts, negotiating contracts, thereby causing an avoidable delay in stopping the spill,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn December 2011, Shell called in OSRL in response to the Bonga oil spill, also in Bayelsa State, and within seven days the spill was stopped.\n\nThe definite volume of crude oil spilled following the Aiteo Nembe blowout is not yet known but it is expected to be hundreds of thousands of barrels, activists have estimated. The Bonga spill of seven days, due to a cut in a hose in the course of transporting crude oil into a tanker, led to the discharge of an estimated 40 thousand barrels into the Atlantic Ocean, according to Environmental Justice Atlas.\n\n\u201cIf any fish enters it, it is dead\u201d\n\nPromise Okubo, who was at Worikumakiri when the wellhead exploded, took a dive into the river, uncertain about what had happened, and swam to a side where he was rescued by Nigerian Navy personnel. Now, sick with breathing difficulties after he braved smokes, he has been visiting local medicine stores.\n\n\u201cBut he requires proper testing to determine his true condition and for proper medication in a hospital,\u201d said Mr Ayebaemi. Apart from Mr Okubo, other residents are reporting breathing difficulties. \u201cPeople especially those who have remained in the area since the spill started are not breathing well and it is difficult for them to leave because this is where they have always known as home and where their survival lies.\u201d\n\nMethane, a greenhouse gas, is a main component of natural gas that the wellhead was spewing alongside crude oil for weeks. At high concentrations, methane exposure can lead to poisoning and and when inhaled cause less oxygen required to breathe, a chemist, Saheed Agboluaje, explained. Citing a medical research article, Mr Agboluaje further said methane inhalation can lead to acute respiratory conditions.\n\n\u201cThis is why medical attention that involves testing is paramount,\u201d Mr. Ayabaemi added, placing a demand on Aiteo, which he said had brought \u201crelief materials\u201d following a protest in early December when the wellhead was still spewing crude oil and gas. \u201cBut it is not worth it; what we want is to recover our livelihoods, not wait for handouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny relief materials, bags of rice, we manage ourselves with them for the moment. When they finish, the hunger returns. We are just there.\u201d\n\nInterpreting a raging aged fisherwoman, whose net had drawn dead fishes, he said, \u201conce you throw your net into the water, you cannot easily bring it out because of the impact of the crude oil. And if any fish enters it, it is dead or bloated with changed colour and a few moments it will die. We cannot do anything. We cannot fish.\u201d\n\nMr. Agboluaje, the chemist, said hydrocarbon pollution on water makes oil cover the surface of the water, \u201cthereby blocking oxygen exchange and causing death of fishes.\u201d\n\nPopular among aquatic animals in the area are periwinkles, tilapia, crabs, barracuda, schoolmaster snapper, and croaker locally called \u201cbroke marriage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe oil wey dey there no small,\u201d a paddler at Shell-kiri, another affected fishing community said, using Nigerian Pidgin commonly spoken in the area to mean, \u201cthe oil in this water is too much.\u201d The paddler was trying to tell the residents on board the water they had depended on for consumption \u2013 in addition to fishing \u2013 had been contaminated\n\nThis was when PREMIUM TIMES visited and the spill had stopped but sheens of oil were seen on the water. In some areas, thicker patches, completely darkening the water, could be seen.\n\nAugusta Moses, a Nembe resident, said rainwater has had \u201ccharcoal-like\u201d colour since the spill. Residents of the affected riverine communities had always depended on rains to make the river water fresh and usable for consumption because during dry seasons the water could be very salty, residents said, concerned the hydrocarbon pollution of their environment may have affected precipitation.\n\nOil from the Niger Delta has been the main source of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange and revenue since 1970s. But the region has suffered neglect and most of the rural communities, like those around Santa Barbara River where oil is actually produced, barely enjoy any human capital enhancement services, including potable water infrastructure, education and healthcare facilities.\n\nThe neglect is just one example of Nigeria\u2019s wider problem of poor governance and corruption. Environmental degradation due to oil exploration and production has left populations in the Niger Delta particularly vulnerable since they mostly depend on the environment for survival as fishers and farmers.\n\nThe consequences include the migration of young persons, who with limited education and skills, descend on urban centres like Port Harcourt or Yenagoa, and rely on petty jobs, and sometimes crime, for survival.\n\n\u201cWhen the environment is destroyed, you have poverty and definitely crimes,\u201d said Mr James. \u201cThat is why you are hearing about sea piracy, kidnapping and other crimes going on in the riverine area. People cannot fish. what can they do? No excuse but there is reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur pieces of evidence\u201d\n\nMr James hinted at plans to pursue legal steps to get Aiteo to compensate victims and \u201cmassively\u201d clean up the environment. \u201cThis matter has to be taken to court to ensure that our people get justice. But this is beyond just a Nembe matter, Bayelsa State Government has put together a technical committee, and Ijaw National Congress is working on it, some interest groups are also on it. The Senate must also look into it.\u201d\n\nMr James, who is the second vice-president of Ijaw National Congress, an activist socio-cultural organisation, demanded an \u201can independent scientific investigation\u201d of the Nembe spill to determine the impacts on \u201cflora and fauna and the effects on our people.\u201d\n\nFor Mr James and his Nembe people, the experience of the Ogoni people in the neighghouring Rivers State, who have suffered decades of environmental degradation due to the oil industry activity and endured struggles, including in courts, to gain compensations and have a process to cleanup their environment commence, is a lesson.\n\n\u201cThe cleanup is happening in Ogoni land because of the seriousness of the Ogoni people and their organised processes. If you do not work for yourself, nobody will do it for you,\u201d Mr James said.\n\nReferring to the fish and crab carcasses and water samples with oil sediments at the bottom in bottles, he said, \u201cthese are our pieces of evidence, for the records, for legal actions to ensure justice for people.\u201d Premium Times\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "How Aiteo, Nigerian regulators misreported Nembe oil spill that caused severe environmental damage",
          "text": "The November 2021 oil spill in Nembe, Bayelsa State, started at least three days earlier than the owner of the well and the federal government publicly acknowledged, a PREMIUM TIMES investigation has found.\n\nThe spill, one of Nigeria\u2019s worst in recent years, lasted more than a month and caused extensive environmental damage with more than a hundred thousand barrels of oil spewed into the environment, according to expert estimates.\n\nOur review of the disaster has shown that oil and gas fumes from a wellhead operated by the Nigerian firm, Aiteo, caused large scale destruction of aquatic lives and damaged water bodies and farms. Residents have also reported health problems after the incident occurred.\n\nAiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company, the operator of the well said it \u201creported\u201d the spill on November 5, and the Federal Ministry of Environment said the incident started November 5.\n\n\u201cAiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), Operator of the NNPC /Aiteo Joint Venture of Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29 on Friday, 5 November 2021, reported a hydrocarbon well head leak in its Santa Barbara, Southwest field, in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State,\u201d the company said in a statement on November 22.\n\nIt added: \u201cImmediately upon noticing the leak, Aiteo notified all relevant regulatory agencies and thereafter mobilized containment resources to limit impact on the environment. As required, Aiteo promptly called for a Joint Inspection Visit (JIV). Due to the high-pressure effusion, the JIV team could not reach the location and that inspection was aborted.\u201d\n\nThe environment ministry, which is the regulatory ministry, was more categorical: \u201cIt can be recalled that the spill occurred on Nov. 5, 2021, in a form of fountain within the proximity of Opu Nembe Community at Well 1, Wellhead located at the Southern Field of Sant Barbara,\u201d it said in a statement by Saghir el Mohammed, its press director, on November 23.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report of the incident, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) comprising the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) and Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), was set up,\u201d the government added.\n\nBut PREMIUM TIMES has learned from witnesses and local officials that the blowout occurred days earlier, and the firm and the regulator were informed before the date they announced. They only began to take action on November 5.\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe law requires that companies report and respond to spills within 24 hours of learning about them. Failure to do so attracts daily fines for the duration of the delay. Because the fines are dismal \u2014 N500,000 a day \u2014 activists say oil companies sometimes feel no urgency to respond until the situation attracts public attention.\n\nThey also said that while Aiteo merely said it \u201creported\u201d the incident on November 5, the government\u2019s outright declaration that the spill took place November 5 means it believed Aiteo had met the requirements of the law.\n\n\u201cThe spill was observed by Aiteo surveillance team on 4th November and confirmed by Aiteo operations team @ about 730Hrs on 5th November, 2021. It was reported to the Commission on Friday 5th, which was within the 24-hour limit stipulated by law,\u201d the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission told PREMIUM TIMES in a message on Friday.\n\nThe director general of NOSDRA, Idris Musa, also told PREMIUM TIMES the spill began on November 4 and Aiteo reported on November 5. Aiteo did not respond to our calls and messages.\n\nBut several witnesses, including fishermen and security personnel who witnessed the start of the spill, said the incident occurred on November 1 \u2014 controverting both the operating firm, Aiteo, and the government.\n\n\u201cThe spill started on November 1 and the community members reported to us on November 2, the same day we escalated it to NOSDRA,\u201d said Mike Karikpo, the Director of Programmes at Environmental Rights Action, the Nigerian chapter of Friends of the Earth International.\n\nDevastating Spill\n\nRotten, discoloured, and mired in sticky crude oil, the fish and crab carcasses Nengi James kept in an old refrigerator in his modest Bayelsa bungalow were causing an overpowering stench as he brought them out a late afternoon in December.\n\nMr James, a veteran of the Niger Delta environmental and resource justice struggle at the height of the oil-rich region\u2019s crisis, had picked the animals dead and washed up from parts of Nembe creeks and the Santa Barbara River. The waters are now blighted by sheens and patches of oil, darkened and grey-brown at different parts.\n\n\u24d8In addition to the animals, Mr James also collected polluted water samples using bottles aboard a boat sailing across the river, which meanders through the Delta area and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe deaths of the aquatic lives followed the oil spill at the OML 29 Well 1 platform \u2013 an active but for long, a non-producing installation at Worikumakiri in the Santa Barbara River, Nembe area of Bayelsa State \u2013 operated by Nigeria\u2019s largest domestic oil firm, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company.Owned by billionaire businessman Benedict Peters, reported in the Pandora Papers to have allegedly bribed fugitive former Nigerian oil minister Alison Diezani-Madueke for favours, Aiteo acquired OML 29 and the Nembe Creek Trunk Line from Royal Dutch Shell in 2015 in a deal that Shell said was worth $1.7 billion. (Mr. Peters has denied bribery allegations.)\n\nOML 29 stretches over an area of 983 square kilometres, producing 43 thousand barrels per day in 2014, and the Nembe Creeks Trunk Line is 100 kilometres long with a capacity of 600 thousand barrels per day, according to Shell. It is a \u201clarge\u201d block and also contains \u201csignificant associated gas volumes,\u201d the natural resources research and consultancy firm, Wood Mackenzie says.\n\nIn Nigeria, oil blocks are joint ventures, JVs, involving the state-owned NNPC and exploration and production companies like Shell, ExonMobil, Total and Chevron, who are the operators. There are also domestic players like Aiteo.\n\nAiteo and Shell are now locked in legal disputes initiated by the former, claiming the Dutch multinational made false claims about the ownership and conditions of the assets and seeking billions of dollars in damages.\n\nDue to the degraded conditions of oil and gas facilities amid a weak regulatory system and unwholesome corporate sustainability practices, as well as vandalism by oil thieves and militants, the Niger Delta has suffered debilitating effects of environmental pollution for decades.\n\nThis has fuelled widespread poverty and discontent in a region where rural populations, who barely benefit from its oil and gas wealth, depend on the environment for livelihood, mostly as fishers and farmers.\n\nQuestionable Disclosure\n\nEstablishing the actual date the spill began is important for a number of reasons, activists and analysts say. First, it is a measure of demonstration of transparency by oil companies that are often accused of misreporting and downplaying spills, and by regulators that regularly face allegations of bias against local communities.\n\nIt also puts a spotlight on the well-acknowledged challenge of regulators having to largely rely on companies for information on oil pollution in the Niger Delta.\n\nResidents of Nembe said for at least 38 days, beginning November 1, the Aiteo Santa Barbara wellhead relentlessly spewed crude oil and associated gas from two points into the creeks and Santa Barbara River, which serves more than 50 fishing communities in Nembe. As the wellhead spurted oil into the mangroves, tides transported the liquid to the land lying on the edges of the river, devastating farmlands.\n\n\u24d8\n\n\u201cEverything is destroyed,\u201d said Kellcy Ayebaemi, fisherman and youth leader for the Nembe riverine communities. \u201cCassava, plantain, palm trees \u2013 all have gone.\u201d\n\nFishers and local officials in the area, including a security operative contracted to protect the wellhead at Worikumakiri, said the blowout happened on November 1.\n\n\u201cIt was 4:30 AM on November 1 that the explosion happened,\u201d Mr. Ayebaemi said. \u201cWe just heard \u2018boom\u2019.\u201d He said the night became bright from the glow of the ferociously spitting wellhead and farther away smoke filled the air.\n\nThe witnesses said company officials visited the facility using a speed boat during the daytime on the same November 1 the wellhead exploded.\n\n\u201cBut the company did nothing and only came back on November 5 to start containment and recovery of crude oil,\u201d said Mr. Ayebaemi. \u201cNormally, they should have acted immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the regulators are weak,\u201d said Bassey Udo, founder of the business-focused website, Mediatracnet. \u201cThey depend on oil companies for information on incidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it is offshore, the companies use their helicopter or speed boats to give the regulators access. So, companies only grant access to information they want the regulators to know,\u201d said Mr Udo, who has reported the Nigerian oil industry for over 20 years.\n\nAnd when the response did start on November 5, efforts were focused on containment of the crude oil flowing through the channel leading to the wellhead. The oil spurting far and into the mangroves could not be contained, witnesses said, explaining the widespread pollution of the water, the mangroves, and the surrounding land.\n\nWritten questions to Aiteo and phone calls to spokesperson Mathew Ndiana-Abasi were not answered. NUPRC did not also honour a request for comment made via written questions to spokesperson Paul Osuh.\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES interviewed Mr James before regulatory officials disclosed the \u201ccause\u201d of the spill, he predicted that NOSDRA and NUPRC would blame sabotage by residents in order to absolve Aiteo of blame.\n\n\u201cNOSDRA has no boat or helicopter, companies take them to offshore sites. They cannot detect or determine anything on their own; so, the government will back Aiteo or any company. They will both say it is sabotage,\u201d Mr James said, foretelling the position Nigerian regulators would take.\n\nEventually, officials from NOSDRA and NUPRC attributed the spill to sabotage following a controversial late December Joint Investigative Visit, JIV, which is a statutory probe involving regulators, operators, the state government, and the impacted communities.\n\nIsmail Baba-Hammed and Adetoyibo Adeyemi, respectively officials of NOSDRA and NUPRC on the JIV, said only vandalism could have caused the blowout, arguing that the pressure from the oil well was not sufficient to cause the wellhead to blow. Citing engineers that helped Aiteo plug the wellhead, the former particularly said the wellhead casing was removed, not worn out, stressing sabotage.\n\nThe Nigerian military has blocked access to the malfunctioned wellhead and the surrounding impacted riverine communities, barring activists and journalists from the area. Only those sanctioned by the government or the company can visit the site.\n\nApart from the military at the Santa Barbara River area, Aiteo has a contracted private security outfit dedicated to the protection of the wellhead. One of the security operatives told PREMIUM TIMES, before the regulatory officials spoke, that the wellhead had not been vandalised and the explosion was sudden. PREMIUM TIMES could not independently confirm that.\n\nHistory of Spills\n\nBayelsa State, which holds no real powers in Nigeria\u2019s natural resource governance system that vests control of all oil and solid minerals in the federal government, faulted the regulators\u2019 position.\n\nBoth parties barely cooperated during the JIV. An initial probe visit was marred after Bayelsa State insisted on including the press to \u201censure transparency\u201d, a position Aiteo officials opposed.\n\n\u201cThis is terribly sad and unfortunate given the fact that NOSDRA and NUPRC are supposed to be regulators and as such should be unbiased and act at all times with integrity,\u201d Biriyai Dambo, who is Bayelsa\u2019s Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, as well as chair of the technical committee on the spill, said in a statement. \u201cFinally, the Government of Bayelsa State completely rejects the JIV of Wednesday, December 22, 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that NOSDRA and NUPRC are biased and are playing a script in cahoots with AITEO.\u201d\n\nFaulting the procedure followed in arriving at the position that the spill was caused by vandalism, Mr Dambo said the components and accessories of the wellhead that were to be inspected had been removed and replaced, which amounted to tampering with and concealing the equipment and evidence.\n\nResidents said two \u201cminor\u201d spills had happened from the same wellhead in 2018 and 2019. \u201cThose ones happened without any response,\u201d said Moses Ayarite, a Nembe youth leader.\n\nOf the previous spills, Mr Dambo said requests by the affected communities to remediate their environment were rebuffed by Aiteo.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked to note that on the day of this latest JIV, when asked about these previous incidents at the exact same wellhead, AITEO denied and NOSDRA kept silent,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the course of the JIV, the behaviour and utterances of representatives of NOSDRA and NUPRC called into question their independence and neutrality.\u201d\n\nMr Dambo maintained that the position of Bayelsa government is that the cause of the spill was equipment failure and that it would take all appropriate steps to pursue environmental justice for itself and the affected communities.\n\nHe said such redress would put an end to the perennial pollution of the environment through \u201creckless and irresponsible oilfield practice that is condoned by a weak or compromised regulatory system.\u201d\n\n\u201cFraudulent misrepresentations\u201d\n\nWhile the cause of the spill continues to stir controversy, what is clear is that the infrastructure was active but non-producing, and was not decommissioned either by Shell before divesting or Aiteo after acquisition.\n\n\u201cThere are regulatory matters guiding assets that are not in use or non-producing. When they are not in use or not connected to pipelines but active, there is a risk of exposure to pressure. So, they need to be temporarily or permanently abandoned and decommissioned for safety but that did not happen in the case of Nembe and that was why the spill happened,\u201d an oil engineer, who is familiar with the OML 29 facilities but sought not to be identified by name, said.\n\n\u201cMany times the multinationals divesting (from) assets in the Niger Delta are leaving near-dead, degraded assets for local businesses without a proper decommissioning programme and the regulatory system is too weak to ensure that is done either before divestment or after an acquisition to keep the environment and people safe.\u201d\n\nExperts worry about the state of the wellhead before the blowout especially given that Aiteo itself is in court demanding damages and claiming Shell had made \u201cfraudulent misrepresentations\u201d about the Nembe Creek Trunk Line, sold alongside OML 29. Aiteo says the trunkline was in a more degraded condition than advertised by Shell.\n\nThe oil engineer suggested that Aiteo may consider legal actions to push blame to Shell if it becomes apparent it would pay compensations to affected communities or bear heavy cleanup costs.\n\nNo preparedness for spill emergency\n\nBesides its delayed reporting, Aiteo has also been criticised for its state of preparedness for spill emergencies.\n\nThe company only succeeded in late November in calling in Halliburton\u2019s Boots and Coots to deal with the spill that was apparently beyond its capacity.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings showed that although there is no law compelling companies to do so, many corporations have plans in place in anticipation of spill emergencies. One common way is to subscribe to Oil Spill Response Limited, OSRL, of Southampton in the United Kingdom, an industry-funded cooperative for spill preparedness and response.\n\nOSRL has among its shareholders, called participant members, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, Petrobas, and Total, among others. According to information on its website, OSRL also allows \u201cassociate members\u201d with a joining fee of 6,500 British pounds and annual subscription rates between 34,433 pounds and 275,466 pounds depending on the volume of production and number of sites.\n\nOSRL promises a \u201cready\u201d and \u201cseamless\u201d spill response. Its associate membership is open to non-shareholding firms and companies like Aiteo could subscribe. A list of its associate members includes Oriental Energy Resources Limited and Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, two Nigerian companies among scores of others based in several countries.\n\n\u201cAiteo does not have the technical capability to respond to the spill and also does not have a subscription with OSRL, which could have mobilised an immediate response action,\u201d a senior regulatory official told PREMIUM TIMES, asking not to be identified by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequence of lacking preparedness by Aiteo was that it had to start looking for experts, negotiating contracts, thereby causing an avoidable delay in stopping the spill,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn December 2011, Shell called in OSRL in response to the Bonga oil spill, also in Bayelsa State, and within seven days the spill was stopped.\n\nThe definite volume of crude oil spilled following the Aiteo Nembe blowout is not yet known but it is expected to be hundreds of thousands of barrels, activists have estimated. The Bonga spill of seven days, due to a cut in a hose in the course of transporting crude oil into a tanker, led to the discharge of an estimated 40 thousand barrels into the Atlantic Ocean, according to Environmental Justice Atlas.\n\n\u201cIf any fish enters it, it is dead\u201d\n\nPromise Okubo, who was at Worikumakiri when the wellhead exploded, took a dive into the river, uncertain about what had happened, and swam to a side where he was rescued by Nigerian Navy personnel. Now, sick with breathing difficulties after he braved smokes, he has been visiting local medicine stores.\n\n\u201cBut he requires proper testing to determine his true condition and for proper medication in a hospital,\u201d said Mr Ayebaemi. Apart from Mr Okubo, other residents are reporting breathing difficulties. \u201cPeople especially those who have remained in the area since the spill started are not breathing well and it is difficult for them to leave because this is where they have always known as home and where their survival lies.\u201d\n\nMethane, a greenhouse gas, is a main component of natural gas that the wellhead was spewing alongside crude oil for weeks. At high concentrations, methane exposure can lead to poisoning and and when inhaled cause less oxygen required to breathe, a chemist, Saheed Agboluaje, explained. Citing a medical research article, Mr Agboluaje further said methane inhalation can lead to acute respiratory conditions.\n\n\u201cThis is why medical attention that involves testing is paramount,\u201d Mr. Ayabaemi added, placing a demand on Aiteo, which he said had brought \u201crelief materials\u201d following a protest in early December when the wellhead was still spewing crude oil and gas. \u201cBut it is not worth it; what we want is to recover our livelihoods, not wait for handouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny relief materials, bags of rice, we manage ourselves with them for the moment. When they finish, the hunger returns. We are just there.\u201d\n\nInterpreting a raging aged fisherwoman, whose net had drawn dead fishes, he said, \u201conce you throw your net into the water, you cannot easily bring it out because of the impact of the crude oil. And if any fish enters it, it is dead or bloated with changed colour and a few moments it will die. We cannot do anything. We cannot fish.\u201d\n\nMr. Agboluaje, the chemist, said hydrocarbon pollution on water makes oil cover the surface of the water, \u201cthereby blocking oxygen exchange and causing death of fishes.\u201d\n\nPopular among aquatic animals in the area are periwinkles, tilapia, crabs, barracuda, schoolmaster snapper, and croaker locally called \u201cbroke marriage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe oil wey dey there no small,\u201d a paddler at Shell-kiri, another affected fishing community said, using Nigerian Pidgin commonly spoken in the area to mean, \u201cthe oil in this water is too much.\u201d The paddler was trying to tell the residents on board the water they had depended on for consumption \u2013 in addition to fishing \u2013 had been contaminated\n\nThis was when PREMIUM TIMES visited and the spill had stopped but sheens of oil were seen on the water. In some areas, thicker patches, completely darkening the water, could be seen.\n\nAugusta Moses, a Nembe resident, said rainwater has had \u201ccharcoal-like\u201d colour since the spill. Residents of the affected riverine communities had always depended on rains to make the river water fresh and usable for consumption because during dry seasons the water could be very salty, residents said, concerned the hydrocarbon pollution of their environment may have affected precipitation.\n\nOil from the Niger Delta has been the main source of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange and revenue since 1970s. But the region has suffered neglect and most of the rural communities, like those around Santa Barbara River where oil is actually produced, barely enjoy any human capital enhancement services, including potable water infrastructure, education and healthcare facilities.\n\nThe neglect is just one example of Nigeria\u2019s wider problem of poor governance and corruption. Environmental degradation due to oil exploration and production has left populations in the Niger Delta particularly vulnerable since they mostly depend on the environment for survival as fishers and farmers.\n\nThe consequences include the migration of young persons, who with limited education and skills, descend on urban centres like Port Harcourt or Yenagoa, and rely on petty jobs, and sometimes crime, for survival.\n\n\u201cWhen the environment is destroyed, you have poverty and definitely crimes,\u201d said Mr James. \u201cThat is why you are hearing about sea piracy, kidnapping and other crimes going on in the riverine area. People cannot fish. what can they do? No excuse but there is reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur pieces of evidence\u201d\n\nMr James hinted at plans to pursue legal steps to get Aiteo to compensate victims and \u201cmassively\u201d clean up the environment. \u201cThis matter has to be taken to court to ensure that our people get justice. But this is beyond just a Nembe matter, Bayelsa State Government has put together a technical committee, and Ijaw National Congress is working on it, some interest groups are also on it. The Senate must also look into it.\u201d\n\nMr James, who is the second vice-president of Ijaw National Congress, an activist socio-cultural organisation, demanded an \u201can independent scientific investigation\u201d of the Nembe spill to determine the impacts on \u201cflora and fauna and the effects on our people.\u201d\n\nFor Mr James and his Nembe people, the experience of the Ogoni people in the neighghouring Rivers State, who have suffered decades of environmental degradation due to the oil industry activity and endured struggles, including in courts, to gain compensations and have a process to cleanup their environment commence, is a lesson.\n\n\u201cThe cleanup is happening in Ogoni land because of the seriousness of the Ogoni people and their organised processes. If you do not work for yourself, nobody will do it for you,\u201d Mr James said.\n\nReferring to the fish and crab carcasses and water samples with oil sediments at the bottom in bottles, he said, \u201cthese are our pieces of evidence, for the records, for legal actions to ensure justice for people.\u201d Premium Times\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Hellfire Memes: Those Behind Trend Sent Gunmen After Me \u2014Mummy G.O",
          "text": "The founder of Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church of God, Evangelist Funmilayo Adebayo, has said those behind the trending Mummy G. O hellfire memes sent gunmen after her.\n\nShe said they have been at it for about eight years now and just recently decided to make use of social media to disgrace her.\n\nThe Evangelist who spoke to BBC Pidgin said they are angry because her messages are pulling their church members away from them and to her own church.\n\nThis is as she addressed some of the quotes attributed to her in several Mummy G.O memes and videos which have gone viral on social media.\n\nAsked to state why her message is always centred on heaven and hellfire, she said, \u201cMy message is to ensure that people make heaven. I want them to avoid things that will prevent them from making heaven, things that will send them to hellfire. My message also prepares people for the rapture because Jesus is coming back, whether people believe it or not. Apart from the message I deliver, God is doing healings and miracles as we get testimonies from all over the world.\u201d\n\nOn if she feels bad about being called Mummy G.O, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel bad about being called Mummy G.O. Why should I feel bad? Many never knew I existed until they were told many bad things about me, but the wise among them will want to know the truth, from there they will know the real me.\n\n\u201c90 per cent of them don\u2019t know me. They are just flexing on social media to flow with the trend. They don\u2019t even know the reason behind the trend. There\u2019s too much stress in this country, so people are easily carried away by anything that will make them laugh. They don\u2019t know that those who started the trend did so to create a scandal. Some didn\u2019t even know I truly exist, they thought it was all a joke. They are not my enemies, they don\u2019t hate me nor do I hate them.\u201d\n\nAddressing the statements captured in the viral videos and memes, Evangelist Funmilayo said, \u201cAll those videos are edited. Even Lucifer, if he\u2019s made a pastor today, will he ever say all those things attributed to me talk less of someone called a holiness preacher? So, most of those things attributed to me were never said by me. The people behind the trend have been at it for over eight years. Sometimes they make use of magazines. When that didn\u2019t work, they sent gunmen after me.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving some strange calls saying \u2018Evangelist Funmilayo you are affecting us. Many of our members hear your message and they pull out of our church. If you don\u2019t stop, we will kill you\u2019.\n\n\u201cI thought it was just a threat until we started seeing gunmen chasing us while driving, coming to our church to threaten us and so on. At times, when I\u2019m inside a banking hall, they take my picture and forward it to me, saying if they wanted to have me killed, they would have done so. They say they will disgrace me if I don\u2019t stop. When they saw that I didn\u2019t stop, they decided to make use of social media trends.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn women wearing makeup, I did say so and that wasn\u2019t the first time I said so. I\u2019ve travelled to many Islamic countries, you will never see their women wear anything that will open their bodies. Even their air hostesses, the way they dress shows they fear God. My stance against indecency would have been supported if it was said 50 years ago. Then, no woman could enter a church without wearing a scarf. The God that frowned against women not wearing scarves, has he travelled or changed? A Muslim lady dare not enter a mosque without her head covered. But because I preached an old message, I\u2019ve suddenly become a criminal. The truth remains the truth even if it\u2019s just one person saying it.\n\n\u201cThousands of callers have told me that God told them to stop using makeup if they want to make heaven. The Bible doesn\u2019t support makeup. Jezebel was the first woman to wear makeup in the Bible. If they say my preaching is too hard, are people expecting me to say the way they dress to a nightclub is allowed in the church?\u201d she asked.\n\nThis is as she cited Deuteronomy 22:5, saying, \u201cNo woman shall wear what pertains to a man and no man shall wear what pertains to a woman.\u201d\n\nFootballers won\u2019t make heaven\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only person who said that. We have people from Ghana who also said the same. Even white men said it too. Just go on Google, search for the god of soccer, it will be shown to you. Why didn\u2019t I say the same about other sports? They just want to arouse every soccer lover against me. The event that will introduce the antichrist to the world will come through the World Cup,\u201d she said.\n\nHow to make heaven\n\nThe RAPEC founder stated that making heaven is the most difficult task on earth because it involves giving up a lifestyle that is not in line with what God loves.\n\n\u201cThe only way to make heaven is the most difficult task on Earth and that is to obey God. The reason why I said it is the most difficult task is that obedience to God is the most painful thing. For example, there is a way we dress that we find appealing, some of which are seductive. Imagine Jesus saying you have to stop dressing in that manner before you can make heaven. Is that not difficult? Also, you have a girlfriend who understands you, gives you business ideas and is okay in every way. Sadly, you are a married man. When your wife nags about money, the girlfriend consoles you. Will it not be painful if you hear a sermon that warns against extra-marital affairs? 80 per cent of what we like are disliked by God. That is why obeying God is difficult,\u201d she said.",

Abdulahi Adamu, disclosed their readiness to ensure fair hearing, equity and justice in carrying out their official exercise in the State.\n\nSpeaking during the courtesy call, the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Abdulahi Adamu, said members of the party have come to attend to palpable contentious matters, treat petitions and elicit responses after which their report would be made in line with the directive of the authority of the party at the national level.\n\nHe said the Committee would be attending to petitions vis-a-vis complaints from the members of the party before coming up with its findings.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Mr. Governor for personally being available to receive us. We are the committee appointed and inaugurated sometimes in November last year to serve as members of the reconciliatory committee on issues that border on relationship and institutional matters.\n\n\u201cWe have done much on the northern states and we started that of Southwest on Thursday in Lagos. Yesterday, we were in Ogun State, and today, we are in Osogbo, the Osun State capital city.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of tradition and respect, when we go to a State like this, where our party is in power, we owe it a duty to pay courtesy on the Governor, because here (Government House) is our home, to announce and inform him we are in his land. That is what brought us here. After this, it is our intention to see what efforts had been made on those who petitioned. If they are identifiable, we want to meet with them.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting them, we will come back to our home to meet the Governor and our party so that if there is any allegation or accusation from the petition received, and after listening to the petitioners, we will listen to the responses in order to ensure fair hearing from all the parties involved.\n\n\u201cOur intention here is to maximize the opportunity of getting evaluation of relevant materials after which we will go to Abuja and sit as a committee and develop what we have in the report, which we will share with the authority of the party at the national level that appointed us.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are here for. Once again, we appreciate the solidarity and love you have shown to receive us. It is our hope that we will have the cooperation to succeed from you, the government and, of course, our genuine party members\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his response, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola assured the Committee of his Administration\u2019s absolute cooperation and support to carry out the exercise.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the composition and ability of the members of the Committee to dispense justice and ensure fair play throughout the exercise.\n\n\u201cI appreciate this visit and I thank you most sincerely for taking the trouble to come to us. No organization without issues, but what is important is to find possible way of reconciliation.\n\n\u201cWe will give you all the support, you will have the maximum cooperation expected of us. I welcome the idea of accepting petitions and finding solutions to all contentious issues.\n\n\u201cWe are peaceful people. Looking at the caliber of people that are involved in the Committee, I have no doubt that reconciliation is possible. The Chairman of the Committee had done so well when he served as Nasarawa Governor, ditto the other Governors in the Committee as well as other members of the Committee.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we are willing to give you all necessary support to make this a success. I hope you will enjoy the hospitality of our State. By any standard, we have not disappointed the party. Within the little we have, we have justified the confidence reposed in us\u201d, Oyetola added.",

          "text": "Fifty years after last hosting the Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroon kick off the continental showpiece on Sunday targeting a sixth title while hoping the spectre of the coronavirus does not overshadow the tournament.\n\nCameroon, who play 2013 runners-up Burkina Faso in their opening Group A match at the vast new 60,000-seat Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, know expectations are high for the Indomitable Lions.\n\nHowever, they will have to measure up to the likes of reigning champions Algeria, the Senegal of Sadio Mane, and Mohamed Salah\u2019s Egypt.\n\nCameroon was initially supposed to be the host nation in 2019, before being stripped of the tournament due to delays in its preparations, with Egypt taking over. The 33rd Cup of Nations was then postponed last year because of the pandemic.\n\nREAD ALSO: Djokovic Tested Positive To COVID-19 In December, Lawyers Tell Court\n\nThe Central African country of 27 million people was, therefore, determined to press on with the competition amid reports last month that leading European clubs wanted it postponed again due to Covid concerns.\n\nThis time it does go ahead, and Cameroon coach Toni Conceicao is well aware of the pressure on his side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what they put on the table when I signed my contract: at least get to the final, do everything to win it,\u201d Conceicao told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the people and history of Cameroon oblige us to do it. It sets the bar pretty high, but we\u2019re convinced we can reach these goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big weight on our shoulders,\u201d added the Portuguese.\n\nAfrican football officials have set down tough Covid-19 rules in a bid to prevent the competition from becoming a super-spreader event, requiring teams to play even if just 11 players are available.\n\nGabon star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was forced to isolate in his hotel after testing positive on Thursday, while Senegal, Africa\u2019s top-ranked national team, travelled to Cameroon without three members of their squad for the same reason.\n\nSenegal then had key defender Kalidou Koulibaly test positive shortly after their arrival.\n\n\u2018Scandal\u2019\n\nBurkina Faso captain Bertrand Traore called the testing procedures a \u201cscandal\u201d after at least four squad members and coach Kamou Malo tested positive in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s opener.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal, we cannot be deprived of first team players 24 hours before the match,\u201d said Traore.\n\n\u201cThe authorities must review the organisation.\u201d\n\nCovid, though, is far from the only concern in a country dealing with a conflict in the English-speaking west.\n\nMatches in Group F, featuring Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania and Gambia, are due to be played in Limbe, a coastal city close to Mount Cameroon which is also a hotspot of separatist unrest.\n\nJihadist raiders also pose a problem in the north, at least beyond the city of Garoua where Salah\u2019s Egypt and Nigeria will play group games.\n\nIt is because of the health crisis that organisers have capped crowd limits at 60 percent of capacity, or 80 percent when the hosts play.\n\nSpectators must be vaccinated and have a negative test result, but only six percent of the adult population is inoculated.\n\nCameroon, though, is football mad and many fans will be desperate to attend games in a country that has only hosted the Cup of Nations once before, in 1972 when there were just eight participants.\n\nHowever, the nation that gave the world the likes of Roger Milla and Samuel Eto\u2019o \u2014 the latter now president of the Cameroonian Football Federation \u2014 no longer boasts the same level of stardust.\n\nComoros, Gambia Debut\n\nThey have Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana and Bayern Munich striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, but the real superstars of the continent will be elsewhere.\n\nSenegal boast not just Liverpool forward Mane but also Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye.\n\nHolders Algeria, unbeaten in 33 competitive games, will be led by Manchester City\u2019s Riyad Mahrez, while Morocco have PSG full-back Achraf Hakimi and Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, amongst others.\n\nNigeria, meanwhile, cross the border without Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, or Watford\u2019s Emmanuel Dennis, whose club said they received notice of his call-up too late.\n\nIn any case this Cup of Nations is not just about the big names, as Gambia, ranked 148th in the world, and the Indian Ocean island state of the Comoros make their debuts.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday. The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on Aug. 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban. Following an exclusive Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own. read more After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul.\n\nDuring the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi \u2013 the boy\u2019s father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy \u2013 and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States. Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him. They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States. Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside.\n\nBut by then the baby was nowhere to be found. Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later. The rest of the family was evacuated \u2013 eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was. The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a 20-year war.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. ALONE AT THE AIRPORT With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one. On the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother\u2019s family who were also set to evacuate.\n\nIn that moment he decided: \u201cI am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview in late November. Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page. Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby\u2019s parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother\u2019s greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son. After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi\u2019s neighbors \u2013 who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby \u2013 recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article.\n\nRazawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts \u2013 including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing \u2013 for Safi and his family. But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi\u2019s brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry. Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family. The baby\u2019s family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby\u2019s family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months. \u201cThe grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby,\u201d said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. \u201cWith both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather,\u201d he said on Saturday. Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him. In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.\n\nThe baby\u2019s parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat. \u201cThere are celebrations, dance, singing,\u201d said Razawi. \u201cIt is just like a wedding indeed.\u201d Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. \u201cHamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport,\u201d Razawi said. Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility,\u201d his grandfather said. \u201cMy wish is that he should return to them.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) generated approximately N938.5 million from fees collected from importers of generators and other internal revenue sources from June 2020 to June 2021, an analysis of the data for the four quarters provided by the industry regulator, has shown.\n\nNERC had in 2013 introduced a N25,000 charge per unit of 100KVA generator imported into the country in its guidelines for obtaining clearance certificate for the importation of generating sets and related matters.\n\nIt also fixed a charge of N3,500 per unit of between 25kva and 100kva generators imported into the country, while generators between 5kva and 25kva attract a charge of N1,000 per unit.\n\nFurthermore, it resolved to begin the collection of N250 per unit of between 2.5kva and 5kva, while between 0.45 Kva and 2.5 Kva generators attract a charge of N150 per unit.\n\nThe amount collected by NERC is exclusive of duties and other taxes paid by the importers in the country.\n\nNigeria still relies largely on generating sets to power its over $400 billion economy.\n\nThe Lagos State government had in October 2021 revealed that as a result of the country\u2019s inefficient and over-centralised electricity supply system, residents of the state alone, generated over 4,500MW daily through the use of generators.\n\nDetails of the financial position of the NERC showed that in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, the IGR from fees arising from the importation of generator sets , licence processing and licencing fee was N431 million.\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that N20.23 million was generated in April, N160.79 million in May and N250.25 million in June of that year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2021, NERC raked in N126.53 million, broken down into N50.80 million, N28.13 million and N47.60 million in January, February and March, respectively.\n\nAn analysis of the last six months of 2020 showed that in the third quarter of 2020, covering July, August and September, the industry regulator made N276.31 million from the same sources, segmented into\n\nN71.10 million, N111.11 million and N94.10 million, in the three months.\n\nSimilarly, in the last three months of 2020, NERC raked in N104.88 million from import fee imposed on the sale of generating sets, among others.\n\nHowever, the total operating levy received from market charges were N4.868 billion for Q2,2021 and N5.061 billion for Q1,2021. Total revenue for the period was N5.299 billion and N5.18 billion respectively, with personnel cost gulping N1 billion and N1.88 billion respectively.\n\nBefore then, in the last six months of 2020, operating levy was N2.64 billion for Q3 and N2.19 billion for Q2, with personnel cost standing at N843 million and N1.17 billion for the two quarters.\n\nBut the commission\u2019s total expenditure profile for the period was N6.1 billion shared into N1.6, N1.0 billion, N2.0 billion and N1.44 billion for the period spanning June 2020 to June 2021.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter under review (Q2,2021), the total revenue realized by the commission was N5.30 billion, about 2.12 per cent higher than the N5.19 billion revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\n\u201cThere was a 230 per cent rise in other internally generated revenue while the operating levy (i.e., market charges) recorded a decline of 3.75 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe higher revenue recorded in 2021/Q2 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the commission stood at N1.44 billion which is lower than the N2.01 billion incurred during the first quarter of 2021,\u201d NERC stated.\n\nFor Q3, 2020, it pointed out that the total revenue that accrued to the commission was N2.93 billion, representing an increase of 31 per cent from the revenue recorded in the second quarter and a decrease of\n\n10 per cent from the revenues recorded in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the improvement in revenues, the commission\u2019s expenditure declined to N1.05 billion in the quarter from N1.36 billion in the second quarter and N1.94billion in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, liabilities also declined to N123 million from N218 million in the preceding quarter. The observed decline in expenditure was due largely to the reduction in operating activities of the\n\ncommission as a result of the Covid-19 movement restriction imposed by the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nAs for the summary of the commission\u2019s revenue and expenditure during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, it stated that the total revenue realised by the commission N1 .95 billion, about 33.35 per\n\ncent lower than the revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\nNERC noted that the higher revenue recorded in 2020/Q3 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees, the grant received from Mac-Arthur foundation and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\nNonetheless, it stressed that both the operating levy (i.e., market charges) and other IGR such as licencing fee charged by the commission declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe operating levy and IGR respectively declined by 30.36 per cent and 62.04 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2020.

          "text": "To end the environmental menace occasioned by black soot in Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike, has tasked the state police command to collaborate with other security agencies, council chairmen and traditional rulers to arrest those involved in crude oil theft for prosecution.\n\nThe governor said the illegal bunkering and artisanal refining leading to black soot in the environment was endangering the health of residents of the state.\n\nWike gave the charge at a dinner and award night for officers of the Rivers State Police Command, held at the Police Officers Mess, Port Harcourt.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, Emeka Woke, the governor declared that the state government had resolved to tackle those involved in crude oil theft and refining.\n\nWike stated that the state government was willing to provide the police and other security agencies all that would be required to dislodge and end the activities of artisanal refiners in the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cthe state is prepared to fight them more than ever before.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that since the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Friday Eboka assumed duties last year, Rivers State has witnessed peace and improved policing.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder the crime index in the state has reduced drastically. We thought we are the only people witnessing it, but with the award you got from the wife of the Inspector General of Police, it is an eloquent testimony that what we are seeing as a state, is also being observed from all the nation.\u201d\n\nThe governor said policing in Rivers State has improved remarkably because the management of the Nigeria Police Force at the Force Headquarters and the State Command, respectively distanced themselves from politics.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we will continue to support the security agencies in the state. Our support for security agencies is not only centered on Police Force. We are also extending similar gesture to the Navy, Air force and others.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe the primary function of any responsible government is to protect life and property. So, we have no option than to continue to support in providing logistics and everything that can make the security agencies in the State to function very well.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that if our people are safe and the life here is peaceful, there will be increase in economics activities and the Internally Generated Revenue will also go up.\u201d\n\nWike commended the CP for discharging his duties professionally.\n\nHe, however, announced N1million reward for each of the recipients of the Rivers State Police Command award and N10 million to the command for organising the event.\n\nSpeaking, Commissioner of Police, Eboka explained that 2021 was a remarkable year for the command because Rivers State emerged as one of the most peaceful state in Nigeria.\n\nHe thanked Almighty God for his grace and Inspector General of Police for choosing Rivers State as the venue for the launching of South-South Operation Restore Peace.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis came with the deployment of special forces with sophisticated equipment as well as combat helicopter to the state\u201d.\n\nHe commended Governor Wike for being very phenomenal in the attainment of peace and security in the state.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption of office, the command has received more than 50 patrol vehicles fitted with modern gadgets from the State government. This gesture alone enhanced visibility policing in the state.\n\n\u201cRecall too, when we lost men to miscreants in sometimes April 2021, the governor did not allow us to suffer alone. He wiped the tears of the deceased families with a total sum N220 million, which means each family received the sum of N20 million.\n\n\u201cRecall the #ENDSARS saga. At the end of that saga, which led to the burning down of police stations and vehicles across the nation, the state governor did not abandon us to work under the trees. Rather, the governor constructed a storey building each for the Area Command, Oyigbo and the Divisional Police in Oyigbo.\u201d\n\nThe recipients of the Rivers State Police Command 2021 awards are: G.I.A Godstime Nwuju, best traffic officer; Inspector Winfrey Ini Akpan, best controller; CSP Bako Aghashim, best DPO; CSP Grace Wonwu, best female DPO; and the best visiting tactical team leader went to CSP Adamu.",

Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thanks Nigerians across the board for the overwhelming interest they have in our party as their sure platform to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule and urges them to remain united and focused as we join forces for the task ahead,\u201d the statement by Olugunagba explained.\n\nMany northern governors and the 17 southern governors had thrown their weight behind the clamour for power shift to the southern part of the country in 2023 to ensure justice and fair play.\n\nSome of the northern governors include Professor Babagana Zulum (Borno); Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina); Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Samuel Ortom (Benu) and Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), among others.\n\nThe southern governors under the leadership of the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had also, irrespective of political affiliation, given a strong position that power \u201cmust move to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nSince 1999 when democracy returned under this dispensation, former President Olusegun Obasanjo governed from (1999-2007); the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (2007 \u2013 2010); former President Goodluck Jonathan (2010-2015); and President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023).\n\nWith the north completing eight years in 2023, it is expected that power will shift to the south.\n\nHowever, some politicians from the north are working hard to retain power beyond 2023.",
