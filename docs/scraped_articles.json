          "text": "The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate on Friday said that it was working to provide a health insurance package for senior citizens.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of PTAD, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, stated this during a two-day pensioners/stakeholders engagement forum held in Enugu which also featured the official unveiling of the \u2018I Am Alive\u2019 confirmation pilot test of pensioners under the Defined Benefits Scheme in the South-East.\n\nEjikeme said to ensure that senior citizens were included in the national health insurance scheme, the Federal Ministry of Health had established a ministerial committee to look into the issue.\n\nShe also said PTAD and representatives of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners were members of the committee.\n\nWhile performing the official launch of the pilot test, the executive secretary said the era of bringing out pensioners for field verification would be over when the platform became fully operational.\n\nShe said PTAD adopted the technology because there was no way to know that a pensioner had died without a report from the pensioners\u2019 union which she said could take several months.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is currently paying over N91bn annually. I am not talking about arrears. I am talking about monthly pension because our monthly pension now is over N9bn. When you add arrears, the gratuities that we pay is a humongous amount.\u201d\n\nShe explained that the \u201cI Am Alive\u201d Confirmation was an online application to confirm that pensioners on the agency\u2019s monthly pension payroll were alive and should continue to receive their pension\n\n\u201cThis is a web-based platform designed to enable our pensioners to easily confirm their aliveness from the comfort of their homes or neighbourhood using either a smartphone or a computer system. This solution takes the pensioner through a three-step confirmation process that ends with a text message response.\n\n\u201cThe directorate has decided to deploy the application in phases, starting with 50,000 pensioners cut across the four operational departments and the six geo-political zones, selected to participate in this pilot phase. On the successful implementation of this pilot phase, we will deploy the application on a full scale at predetermined intervals continuously for all verified pensioners on the payroll.\n\nShe added, \u201cWe are consequently in collaboration with some of our stakeholders, including the National Health Insurance Scheme, the National Senior Citizens Centre, and Federal Ministry of Health to see how making health insurance available to our pensioners can be a reality.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has described the \u201cdeclaration\u201d by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government of having lifted its unconstitutional ban on use of Twitter in Nigeria as \u201cfurther demonstration of its appetite to suppress constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Caucus asked the government to apologize to Nigerians for infringing of the rights of Nigerians, stressing that the ban had caused many economic losses.\n\nThe charge was contained in a statement by the minority leader of the House, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu on Friday.\n\nThe statement read thus: \u201cThe caucus holds that freedom of speech and opinion by Nigerians, including expressing such through social media tools like Twitter, are clearly guaranteed in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and cannot be subjected to partisan approval or regulation under a democratic rule.\n\n\u201cThat is why at the wake of the ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria in June 2021, the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives forcefully condemned the decision as provocative, obnoxious and unjustifiable clampdown on the rights of Nigerians which also showed the APC government\u2019s intolerance and aversion to the views, opinions and aspirations of Nigerian citizens, especially the youths, on matters of state.\n\nALSO READ: The conditions FG gave Twitter\n\n\u201cIt was also in the light of that that the Minority Caucus in the National Assembly stood by the law and charged Nigerians to continue using Twitter irrespective of the unconstitutional ban, since they would not be contravening any known law in Nigeria or any international statutes.\n\n\u201cOur caucus holds that the declaration of a lift on the ban on Twitter amounts to regulatory approval on freedom of speech, which is completely unknown to our laws. The APC government should rather be apologizing to Nigerians for infringing on their rights as well as for the huge economic losses recorded as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cThe Minority Caucus insists that instead of seeking to suppress free speech in our country, the APC government should be open to the views of Nigerians and make adjustments for the good of the nation.\n\n*Our Caucus commends Nigerians for their resilience, innovations and resistance to suppression by the APC government and assures that the caucus will never relent in fighting for the rights of the people at all times.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Having observed that the hospital was experiencing a shortage of staff, she resided in the hospital for a month, volunteering as a health worker and support staff to the hospital.\n\n\u201cMeeting you all today is a reminder of the many achievements of young people across Nigeria. Daily, we have Nigerians in our armed forces leaving behind family and friends to serve our country in various internal security operations.\n\n\u201cWe have seen how young Nigerians rallied in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and designed various technology solutions to support the government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen young Nigerians break new ground and earn global acclaim in innovation, in technology, in sports and the arts and entertainment.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s clear to us that our young people are our most valuable assets, and the Federal Government believes that they must be encouraged and supported in every way, which is why we\u2019re currently raising about $500 million to support technology and creativity.\n\n\u201cThe project is led by the African Development Bank, which has already committed $170 million to the enterprise, and this will be supported by the Federal Government, Islamic Development Bank and the French Development Agency.\n\n\u201cLast year, Mr. President launched the Nigeria Jubilee Fellowship Programme. This is a programme supported by the UNDP and the European Union and private sector and many people in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt will run for five years and it will give well paid work experience opportunities to 20,000 young Nigerians every year in select private sector and public sector organisations.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that these interns will gain relevant career and life skills that will enable them to transition seamlessly into the professional, business or public sector, while also earning good pay during the period of their internship.\n\n\u201cI hope that many of you, our gold award winners, will participate in that programme and will be a part of that programme and experience all of the benefits of the programme.\u201d\n\nIAYP Board of Trustee Chairman, Edun, explained the process of participating in the programme which he said had produced 44 young Nigerians who have reached the apex of a long race to the peak.\n\nHe said the programme had produced more than a million young participants globally, mentored through the process by more than 200,000 adults.\n\nEdun said: \u201cWhat we have just witnessed in the presence of His Excellency, the Vice President of the Federal Republic, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, is the Gold Award Ceremony, where the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Gold Award was conferred on 44 youngsters who have achieved that level in this programme, which is of full curricular, non-formal, out-of-the-classroom education. It is a worldwide platform and brand, and it just empowers youngsters.\n\n\u201cAlongside their formal education, it gives them the skills and confidence to go out into the world and to increase their employability, their chances of success in the world.\n\n\u201cSo, it is very gratifying and very encouraging for the youngsters that no less a personality than His Excellency the Vice President was there to recognise their achievements and confer upon them the award itself.\n\n\u201cThe award itself was founded by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh who, as we all know, was the husband of the Queen of England. And since then, over a million youngsters worldwide have participated in the event.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the youngsters, there are the adults. In order to put young people through this programme and not only ensure that they benefit from it but they have the opportunity to have fun, to have adventure and to enjoy themselves as young people, you need adults, and about 200,000 adults have mentored them through this award.\n\n\u201cIt is a combination of the whole society, the young people, but also the adults, the financial supporters, for those who can\u2019t afford for their parents to pay for them to go through the world. We have corporate sponsors, individual Nigerians and people generally supporting the ability of young people to go through this unique programme.\u201d\n\nAsked if there is any mechanism for monitoring the progress of participants, Edun added: \u201cThey are mentored through it and they have to meet standards.\n\n\u201cBefore you can get to gold, you have met the highest of standards.\n\n\u201cSo, yes, the whole initiative has clear standards and objective measurements that are set, and it is only those that achieved that high standard that achieve the gold award, and they are measured and benchmarked, not just in Nigeria, but internationally.\u201d\n\nThe event, which drew attendance from graduands, their parents and teachers, former participants and others, was graced by British Deputy High Commissioner, Jill Atkinson.",

          "text": "After months of speculations about his next political move, former Lagos State Governor and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Monday, formally declared his intention to run for the country\u2019s presidency in 2023.\n\nHe disclosed this after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja. In his interview with State House correspondents, Tinubu said it has been his life-long ambition to serve the country as president.\n\nExpectedly, he made news all through the week. He is still trending in the aftermath of his public declaration of his presidential ambition.\n\nAlready, his declaration has triggered a race amongst chieftains of his party to similarly announce their interest in the race.\n\nIn the words of Majority Leader of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Sanai Agunbiade, \u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is a man of many firsts. And he has as usual scored another first by causing others to remember they have presidential ambitions.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAfter his encounter with Buhari, journalists wanted to know why the acclaimed kingmaker now wanted the main prize. Not one to be caught unawares, Tinubu had an answer waiting. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere in the world where a kingmaker cannot himself be king.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I have never seen where it is written in the rulebook anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless he has committed murder. \u201d\n\nHe equally shrugged off the question about him and his age-long political prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, possibly battling for the APC presidential ticket, by saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself.\u201d\n\nTinubu wasted no time in assuring his listeners of his qualification for the top job. \u201cI have the confidence, vision and capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve done that before in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nReactions have continued to greet his disclosure. While his aspiration is garnering widespread support from supporters nationwide, critics of his politics, like the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said he was on a \u201cjourney bound to nowhere.\u201d\n\nOn various social media platforms, Tinubu\u2019s declaration was almost the only item being discussed since Monday. While his critics are strongly opposing his aspiration, his supporters are all out to convince doubters that the former Lagos governor is the man for the job.\n\nInterestingly, both his critics and supporters seem to agree on his eligibility and preparedness for the job. \u201cTinubu is qualified for the job. He has the network to be a good president but we want a new face in Aso Rock,\u201d Douglas Ofulue, a Facebook user said.\n\nIn a ready counter, a social media group under the auspices of the Tinubu Defenders, says the only way to repay Tinubu for his sacrifices for the country is to hand him the APC ticket. The convener of the group, Bola Bada, explained that members of the platform were ready to give their support for Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nFormer member of House of Representatives and Director General of the Tinubu Support Group Management Council, Abdulmumin Jibrin, said the APC leader was in the race to compete with others and was way ahead of the competition in terms of popularity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are other candidates. We are not campaigning that they should not contest; they should come out. After all, we are one and after the primaries, we are coming together as one. So, we are fine with everyone. We are ready to face everyone vote for vote\u201d.\n\n\u201cEverywhere you go, especially, in the northern part of the country, it is Asiwaju and I am able to see that. I am not a politician, who sits in Abuja. I am a proper grassroots politician, so I go to the grassroots, not only in my own state but all over the northern part of the country. I hold gatherings with over 5,000 persons in attendance. I have also been in this game for a while, so, I have contact of the people who are going to vote.\u201d\n\nAllaying fears of an implosion in APC should Tinubu square up with other prominent chieftains for the presidential ticket, Jibrin said, \u201cTinubu is an experienced politician. He will look at everybody and see how everybody is going to be involved. I have no doubt that he will carry everybody along.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, this deft political move by Tinubu towards the realisation of his life-long dream to govern the country, will be discussed for a long time to come.",

          "text": "A major crisis is brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia State following alleged plot by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and his kinsmen to support a candidate from his Ngwa clan to succeed him.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu is from Obingwa Local Government Area, one of six councils that make up Ngwaland in Abia South senatorial district.\n\nSources revealed that Governor Ikpeazu and his kinsmen are plotting to ensure the PDP candidate for the 2023 governorship election comes from the Ngwa side of the Abia Central senatorial district.\n\nAbia South senatorial district has six local government areas, with three from the Ngwaland and three from the Umuahia area of the state.\n\nIt was gathered that in breach of the Abia Charter of Equity, Governor Ikpeazu has told some political stakeholders that his interest is to get a successor from Isiala Ngwa part of the Abia Central.\n\nWhen contacted, media aides of Governor Ikpeazu declined comments, saying their principal has not made any public pronouncement on the 2023 governorship election.\n\nThere\u2019s currently contention as to where power will rotate in Abia State in the next governorship election.\n\nWhile Abia North senatorial zone, with five local government areas, claims that naturally it should produce the next governor, since the first civilian governor in the current political dispensation came from the zone in 1999, in the person of the current Senate Chip Whip,\n\nOrji Uzor Kalu, politicians from the Ngwa area say one of them from Abia Central should be\n\nnext governor.\n\nAlready, all three senatorial zones in Abia have produced governors. Kalu, who was governor for eight years (1999- 2007) is from Abia North. He was succeeded by Theodore Orji, from Abia Central, who\n\nruled for eight years (2007- 2015). Governor Ikpeazu is from Abia South. By 2023, he would have completed eight years, having assumed office in 2015.\n\nLike in Anambra State, where the next round of power rotation is starting from Anambra South, which produced the first elected governor in 1999, with the election of former Central Bank Governor,\n\nChukwuma Soludo, Abia North is looking forward to producing next governor.\n\nThe zone believes for fairness and equity, it should produce the next governor.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that the body language of Governor Ikpeazu and his private comments show he wants power to shift to Abia Central, with particular interest in his Ngwa area of the senatorial district producing the governor.\n\nSources revealed that with empowerment of the Ngwa block by the Ikpeazu government in the last seven years, the zone believes it has the resources to outbid Abia North in the governorship election.\n\nAlready, Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, from the same Obingwa Local Government Area as Governor Ikpeazu, from Abia South, has indicated interest to contest the governorship election in 2023. Other aspirants of Ngwa origin are expected to also join the race in due course. Former governor Orji and Speaker of the Abua State House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji, who are political power brokers in PDP from Abia Central, have not made any public pronouncement on the 2023\n\ngovernorship.\n\nThe duo were instrumental to the emergence of Ikpeazu as governor in 2015. While there are speculations that Speaker Orji is interested in being governor in future, it could not be ascertained if he\n\nwill bid for it in 2023 or later in his political career.\n\nMeanwhile, politicians from Abia North in PDP are galvanising support to bid for the governorship.\n\nSources revealed that Abia North elements in PDP have been reaching out to stakeholders in Abia South and Abia Central to impress it on them that it is their turn to produce the next governor.\n\nThe deputy governor, who was former speaker in the state, Ude Oko Chukwu, is from Abia North.\n\nA member of PDP from Abia North, who pleaded anonymity, revealed that the zone is determined to fight for its right in the 2023 governorship election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our turn to produce the next governor. Our demand is based on equity and fairness. We will not allow an arrangement where an Ngwa man will hand over to another Ngwa man, even if they are from different senatorial zones. Doing so is insensitive to the feelings and rights of others. We Igbo cannot be saying it is our turn to produce Nigeria\u2019s president and some Igbo would want a brother to hand over to a brother in Abia. It is contradictory. We will resist it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was gathered that the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia is likely to maintain the rotation pattern in the state, by presenting a candidate from Abia North.\n\nThe APC has such political bigwigs as Senator Kalu; Minister of State for Steel Development, Uche Ogah; former chief of army staff, Azubuike Ihejirika; spokesman of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu and Nkeiruka Onyejocha, House deputy majority leader. Others are Alex Otti, former managing director, Diamond Bank Plc; Marc Wabara, former managing director, Hallmark Bank; and Chris Adeghije, among others.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "title": "2023 presidency: Why I\u2019m yet to join presidential race \u2013Orji Kalu",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nSenate Chief Whip and Former governor of Abia State, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu has given reasons why he is hesitant to declare for the 2023 presidential race. Speaking yesterday on Arise Television, he said among others that certain variables are key to his ambition.\n\nAre you in any doubt that the presidency of 2023 would not be zoned to the South and that was why you said if your party decides to zone it to the South; is there something you know that we do not know about the possibility of the APC zoning the seat to the North or any other part of the country? Again, the emerging fashion these days is for everybody to go to the villa to inform the president formally that they are interested in the presidency of Nigeria. At least two persons from your party have done that but you did not go there; are you trying to snub the president of Nigeria or you don\u2019t think it is a good thing to go and take permission before declaring interest in the presidency?\n\nThank you Rueben; first of all I want to thank you and your crew for this opportunity. Secondly, I would like to make it clear to you that I do not own the party, neither does Tinubu or any other person own the party. This party is owned by the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people are the only ones who you know own the party; in a democratic setting, the majority always have their way. This is because unless the party zones it to us, if we go by the majority, in our next convention, if it is not properly settled and agreed upon, none of us would get it. This is why I said that there is no need going to say I want to contest or I do not want to contest until the APC National Convention Committee says it is going to go to the South most probably to the South East; a Nigerian president from the South East. Then thirdly, I cannot snub the president; how can I snub the president, the leader of the party? You cannot snub a man that sits at the right side of the chair. What I am just trying to do is to be careful in informing him. If I go and tell him I want to run for the president now and the party did not zone it to where I can have the opportunity to contest, I would not be so nice to myself. I can go and see the president and talk about other things like I have more pressing things in the South East, part of North West and North East as the Senate Chief Whip; I will be going in a couple of days to go and see him but not about the presidency. I must also not go with the Press; I might just walk in and discuss with him about the state of affairs in Nigeria. I am really not afraid about informing Nigerians. I can come out tomorrow and say from day one that I want to run but that is not a reasonable thing to do. You have the party and this party is not owned by me, neither is it owned by anybody. It is going to be owned by the majority of the Nigerian people who would be voting and saying it should go South, East North and so on. For me, the only two zones in Nigeria that have never produced the president are the North East and South East. So, let us be careful in what we are doing. I am committed to what I am doing. I am a committed person and I am committed to anything I put my heart in. I do not want to draw the dagger and go back.\n\nSo, what we have from you now is conditional declaration but let us address the elephant in the room; the fact that your trial for fraud had been adjourned to March this year, what then qualifies you to run for presidency when you have such charges hanging around you?\n\nI do not have any charges hanging around me; it is you the press that creates what you call charges and I am not supposed to talk about matters in court because you should know better that what I went to court to do is not about charges; I went to court to ask that some of my assets should be released. The matter is in court and I would not like to discuss that matter further because it is still in court. I cannot say anything; even you Rueben, you know me pre 1991, 1992 to 93,94, I bankrolled all the money politicians paid during that period. I was the one who brought the money in the PDP. So, how can I become a thief suddenly? I do not want to talk about that. People are pursuing me because they know I want to become president from Day one. They know. So, I do not want to talk about that; I have a lot of respect for our court system and talking about our court system here might not look nice. It might be looking down on the other arm of government. I am in one arm of the government and I would not like anybody looking down on the legislature. I would not want to answer any question on that further. If it is why you called me here, I am not going to answer or say anything further on that at all. So, it is a closed matter because it is before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nWho are those pursuing you; you said people are pursuing you. We would like to know?\n\nYou know them; they are Nigerians who want to be president. They are Nigerians who want to set me aside; they are Nigerians who just want to destroy me. Rueben, you knew me in 1991; I used to come to Alex Ibru; you knew where I lived in Victoria Island; you knew me where I was in Apapa where I used to do my shipping business and import sugar, rice and the rest of them. You know that there is a lot of jealousy in this system. A lot of people who think I became too successful at age 30; why must I have money and have power. Is life like that? You know that these people carelessly put me in prison for six months for doing nothing. I am not bitter about it because it is God\u2019s will. It is our court system that put me in prison.\n\nYou did nothing about the N7billion fraud; it is just these people that put you in prison; you mean you did nothing; they just put you in prison?\n\nThere were 19 witnesses in the court of competent jurisdiction. Nobody mentioned my name; nobody traced anything to me; nothing. I do not want to talk about this matter. Don\u2019t drag me into it. I do not want any court to come tomorrow and say I have violated the rules of the court please. I have obeyed the rules of the court. The court would say come back tomorrow and I would go; they would say come back next tomorrow and I would be there next tomorrow. I tried to do that because I am a Nigerian. I have the competence to stand trial anywhere because it is a process that a country should test on how people obey the rule of law.\n\nJust in case the APC decides to zone the presidency to the South and you go through the primaries and emerge, what should Nigerians expect from an Orji Uzor Kalu presidency? What would be the priorities of your administration?\n\nTo be honest with you, when I was governor, people were not going into Aba. It was a criminal setup there; there was something they called Ibu Alhaji, it was criminalized. My first priority would be to give the Nigerian people freedom from terrorism, banditry and anything you call it from Sahara desert to Atlantic ocean. I would like to give them the freedom to go to anywhere they wantbecause that is the freedom anybody needs and I am capable of doing that. My first priority would be security of lives and property of our people. When I was governor, the first thing I did was to clean the place up of criminals. The DSS saw that, the police saw that, the Army saw that from 1999 to 2007. You can leave your car in Aba, in Abia State and go anywhere; if people would say the truth. People were moving freely and I went to rescue Anambra State also; to give them a security roadmap. My wife is from Anambra State; I had to help the then governor, Mbadinuju to take the security steps. Onitsha, Nnewi and those places were no go areas. I know what to do. First would be security; secondly would be to restore the confidence of Nigerians; to give them the confidence to say they are Nigerians. The youth, elderly people, men and women need the confidence to go to the United States, UK and anywhere and say they are proudly Nigerians. That is the dress I want to wear. Confidence is everything. We have lost confidence in where we are coming from. Number three is to go back to the commercialized electricity to make sure we restore electricity to our people. Once we have electricity, we have everything. Every other thing would follow; I do not want to talk about roads. Believe me, I would create an economic miracle for the Nigerian people. This is what we need. Politics should be out of it. I would work with a good team to make sure that the banker, trader, artisan, industrialist, student and everybody has a feeling that they are Nigerians and that we can manage the economy very well. Our former formal focus would be on the economy and security.\n\nThe quest for a president of Igbo extraction as you have observed is for equity and justice; that includes anything from restructuring, self-determination to even secession. How would you handle all these yearnings if you emerge the president?\n\nI do not know what you people call restructuring because what I have always said is that there are too many loads in the other arm of the constitution. I am not going to talk about restructuring; first and foremost, you have to restructure a country when you are safe. I have to first of all face the issue of bandits and terrorism. I have to face the issue of hunger. I have to restore the confidence of the people. Those are not going to be my basic concerns. My basic concern is to go to the National Assembly, to the constitution because you cannot restructure without the National Assembly. A lot of our people are thinking that we will just wake up one day and say we do not want to use this constitution again. In which country does that happen? We have a union paper called the constitution. The constitution is what is binding all of us together. You cannot come out one day and say I want to restructure this country without properly going through amendment of the constitution. And the only authority that can do anything that you will call restructuring is the National Assembly. I will use the legal way to persuade the National Assembly to do what the Nigerian people would like us to do. That is democracy. I don\u2019t want to sit in my house or my office and be shouting restructuring. I know that the country needs some adjustments to be able to be profitable. We shall look at all those things through the National Assembly. That is the only way Nigeria can be viable to move forward.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nYou want to run for president; we would like to know more about you, your credentials, school you attended and secondly, you said you made money at a tender age, how did you make your money?\n\nWhen I was a student at the University of Maiduguri was when I started doing business; it was when I went to Maiduguri I found out that palm oil was a very lucrative business in Maiduguri. They don\u2019t have palm oil and whenever I am back for holiday, I would buy palm oil and go back; when I was coming back, I would buy dry fish from Baga in Gamboru Ngala local government and sell. I started like that and I moved on and started supplying cables to Chad River basin Authority. I built a furniture company in Maiduguri. It was very viable because all those people there were importing furniture from abroad and I felt that I should also go into the business. I entered into the business and became a very big giant. I competed with Santana furniture, Alhaji Brima and co. So, from there, when there was this war going on in Chad, there was this border problem between Chad and Nigeria, President Buhari was GOC, Jos and Babangida was Director of Army Staff Duties and he was moved from Lagos to Chad, luckily I ran into both of them and this is how I knew both of them. I started supplying food to the people in the warfront. The soldiers\u2019 food was supplied by my company. From there, when there was a problem in the University, 14 of us then were suspended. I was not expelled. I came back to the University authority led by Jibril Aminu; they wanted me back but I said no, I am part of the leadership; a leader must be a dumping ground. I said no, I would not be able to come back unless all of us are coming back. He called me because he was my father\u2019s friend that I would suffer a heavy consequence if I did not go back to school. I said no that I was not going to go back unless all of us go back together. That is the reason for the love people of that area have for me. So, I went to Lagos to start dealing on military equipment and armament and from there, we ventured into export of crude oil and all the rest of them. I started importing sugar, rice and all kinds of commodities in Lagos. By then, my office was in Calcutta crescent; Dangote\u2019s was in Creek Road. So, we were competitors in Rice and Sugar. I was one of the largest importers of rice and sugar. If Dangote is here, he would also bear me witness. For me, making money is an art. Then I started building industries in Aba; that\u2019s how those industries sprang up.\n\nYou said you were suspended in the University of Maiduguri, which school did you finally finish from? Did you eventually go back to school?\n\nYes, I finished at the Abia State University. I went to Eziama High School, Aba and from there, I went to Government College, Umuahia where I took my school certificate. I went for an Exchange programme in Barewa College, Zaria for six months to one year; with the holidays, it was about eight months. I was in the final year at the University of Maiduguri(the only exam I did not take then was PS 461 and 462); I should have graduated from there; when I was called back, I refused.\n\nMany of these things are available online; let us deal with governance issues; how would you rate the Buhari administration? How would you rate your successors after you left government since 2007? You were succeeded by Senator Theodore Orji and later Governor Ikpeazu. Have they been able to sustain what you left behind and then the Buhari administration?\n\nLet me be honest with you; Buhari administration has done very well in all facets. God brings every leader for whatever He wants to achieve. I will rate Buhari administration very highly because if he did not come in, maybe we would not have Nigeria by now. Honestly, Rueben, why I continue calling you is because you know me personally; you know I am not a sycophant. When I was living in Lagos, I discussed with you privately if you came to see me and you know my views about Nigeria. You know I believe in this country. You know I am detribilised. The Buhari administration has done very well in fighting banditry. We do not have enough resources to fight these people. The issue is not Buhari; the issue is that if the governors are putting their feet down to say you cannot do these things here, we would not be where we are. It is not about Buhari but also people knowing what they are supposed to do and doing it. I am not saying they are not doing anything. I like Governor Zulum; I like Wike even though some people might not like Wike for his ruggedness; I like Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu State. You have to put your foot down and say these people, I do not want you there. If you do not want them, they would not be there. The thing starts from the primary area and not the secondary level. Buhari is just the president of Nigeria. When Obasanjo was president; there was a night that it was a firing point; the present DG of SSS was the Director of SSS in Abia. Throughout the night, it was a firing point. The level of fighting that night by these armed bandits in front of Government House, Umuahia was so much that I woke up President Obasanjo at about 2.30 am and I was awake with him till about 4.45 am and those people were still shooting. So, governors need to stand up and fight the war. More of the fights lie with the governors not with Buhari. Buhari is just the president. You are receiving allocations and everything. First of all, those armed bandits, the economy is suffering from it. Even the industry capacity is very low. Is it Buhari who is going to kick-start the industry capacity? The capacity utilization is very low; the input and output very low; people always believe they want to import when they have not done anything. I disagree with some policies the Buhari administration has executed like the N500billion social investment fund; it was money thrown into the Atlantic Ocean. I have said it before the president; I have said it before the late Chief of Staff. That one I don\u2019t agree with them but Buhari has done very well as a president. Some people say he hates the Igbo but I do not see that because the largest investment is done in Igbo land. Most of the things he is doing are there. He might have a problem with the Igbo but I do not see that. I see a man who is committed to fighting for Nigeria. Wherever he stops, we would choose those things he has done and continue from there because he has done very well. He is a title holder in my village and I am also a title holder in his village. Mind you I have followed Buhari not because he is the president. People are just following Buhari because he is the president. When he was campaigning in ANPP, they locked the Stadium and I brought him back and went with him to campaign as governor of PDP. I made him known to people that this was a family friend and that I had nothing to do with his party. As a former president, friend of our family and as a title holder in Igbere, I had to come with him. But when I left, the other administration after me locked the stadium against him. The APC has done very well; we have some imperfections yes; they are not perfect in economy which is where I am an expert that I am going to address. President Buhari cannot do everything in one day. We have to adjust here and there and move forward. Government is a continuum. Wherever he stops, we take over from there and improve on it. Everybody would expect that his son would be better than him. I am going to be 62 years old on April 21 and President Buhari is my father. I would work to be better than what he has done for the benefit of all Nigerians. On the issue of those who took over from me, if I am saying this, I am not a coward; only few days ago, I was in the house of my governor and I said it openly, google and see it. I said to the governor, I would never criticize you or praise you in public. I went to see him and I went upstairs and told him things. I came naked to him and he came naked to him. I blamed him where he deserved blame and praised him where he needed to be praised. I told him I would never sing his praises and when I came out, the Press asked me what did you discuss with the governor and I said you know that I can never praise or condemn the governor in public. I was a former governor of that state. Whatever I would discuss with them, I would do that inside the room because I was a former governor. Just like if God helps me and I happen to be the president of Nigeria, you want me to discuss what I saw with President Buhari or what he has done as president. No. I will not discuss it but I will go back to him to Daura even if it means every three months to see the president and discuss issues with him. We must start helping our elders to know that they are elders so that when they exit, they would still be advisers. What is happening in Nigeria is that every president, governor, minister, commissioner, whoever he succeeds would be his enemy. It is not the way to go. If the man I left office for handles me as an enemy, so be it.\n\nPresident Buhari would certainly agree with your appraisal of his performance but in his exclusive interview last June with Arise News, he said that governors cannot just sit back after winning an election and expect others to do the job of security for them. He said they should engage with community and traditional leaders. What is your take on that and his stance against state police?\n\nTo be honest with you, even when I was governor, I have always believed that we should have state police. I don\u2019t have the same opinion with the president on state police. I have always believed that if we have a bill for an act that can convince the National Assembly, why not, we could have state police but we need to put checks and balances in those state police. The state police is good and bad. So, the advantages are like the disadvantages. If you do not have enough checks and balances, to check whoever would be the commissioner of police or this and that, the governors would do what we are seeing also in local government funds. The local governments are supposed to be very independent. So, I believe in what President Buhari said. I seem to be changing my views that the state police is still very good for us but you need the amendment of the constitution. I also believe that state governors are not engaging well; most of the governors do not engage stakeholders. When I was governor, one of my commissioners of police was A.A Abubakar who passed out as IG. Him and Bichi were there with me and they can tell you that we were having regular security meetings every week. If I was not there, the deputy governor would sit in and if the deputy governor was not there, the Secretary to the government would sit in. We were talking about community, meeting with traditional rulers, youths, market women, traders and finding strategies to keep peace in our state. So, unless governors go back to start doing that, there is not going to be a change. Buhari cannot takeover security from the governors because it is in their hands. They should go back and do due diligence on the security system. On the N500 billion, I wrote a paper to the late Chief of Staff and we discussed it; I even went to see the president. I advised against using N500 billion for social development; it was worthless as far as I was concerned. First year in 2015, you would have sent N10 billion each to the senatorial districts for a business man to borrow this money at one percent. If it is in Kano, groundnut, if it is in Abia, palm, in Osun Koko and so on to the 36 states. The first year in 2015, and second year 2016, you do the same thing to the second senatorial districts and the third year, you do the same to the last Senatorial districts. You lend to business men that have land to cultivate and they would employ people and do agriculture. They should lend the money directly from the Central Bank without a middle man so that there would be no stories. The money would generate and put us back to productivity. We should have been able to produce and feed ourselves in the first three years of being president. You would see that Nigerians would be able to feed themselves because they would produce food for our consumption and export. The fourth year, we are going to put small scale industries the same way, giving different business men N10 billion each. Nigeria must go back to production if we want to survive as a nation.\n\nIf you give an Igbo man N10 billion and he starts a business in Onitsha, he is faced with the problem of sit-at-home and that brings us to the issue \u2013what did you discuss with Nnamdi Kanu and what is your take on the IPOB situation?\n\nWhat I discussed with Nnamdi Kanu is sacrosanct between me and him; it was a private discussion and I am not going to tell you. Period! I am not going to discuss that with you. This is me and this is who I am.\n\nOn the IPOB case still, how can we bring peace to the South East?\n\nThere is a court process and it has to finish. If we finish the court process, we would now see if we can ask the president to pardon Kanu. When people are asking the president for pardon, what are they asking for? I believe this case is already in court of competent jurisdiction and I don\u2019t want to discuss it. Let the court process take its course. Before, when Nnamdi Kanu was in Kuje prison, I don\u2019t want to call names, with a top security agent, I went to prison to bail him and he was given bail. It nearly took my head; I didn\u2019t bail him but I committed my person that Kanu should be bailed. That was when I entered APC in 2016. I went to the father and mother of Nnamdi Kanu; I briefed them and I said please if you can beg him to do his IPOB with care. I handled the IPOB people when I was governor. I said you could carry your flags but immediately I see you with arms, I would come after you. You can say you want Biafra; there is nothing wrong with that. You can carry your flag and say you want Biafra or you want that but you don\u2019t kill people or go harassing people.\n\nDo you have any anxieties about certain things that people may bring up if you decide eventually to run for the presidency in 2023? Are there certain things that you worry about? For example, your former deputy, Enyinnaya Abaribe wrote a book \u2018Made in Aba: A life of coincidencies\u2019 and he was not kind to you at all in that book. Do you sometimes feel uncomfortable that these are things people would bring up?\n\nNo, no. I do not have anything whatsoever; let me tell you, apart from this gang up to put me in prison, I never had any gang up against me anywhere. I am not afraid of anybody. I am only afraid of God. I am not afraid of anything and I am the most prepared presidential candidate to be on the field. Even if I am old, I am young at heart. I can go with the boys to dance disco in the night and I can come with the serious people in the afternoon to do the business of government. The most important thing is the business of the unity of the country. I have never done anything to make me not to sleep. I have never done anything that would make me to be afraid of anybody. I have been on the street for a very long time. I know my problems. You know that they conspired against me.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe price of Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG), popularly called cooking gas which hit the roof top about five months ago selling at N8,500 per 12.5kg is set to crash to an all time low as the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG), has approved the supply of 100 per cent of the company\u2019s LPG production(Propane and Butane) into the Nigerian domestic market.\n\nThe development may not be unconnected with strong calls and appeals from stakeholders in the gas sector that NLNG increase its supply of LPG into the domestic market which they claim accounts for about 65 per cent.\n\nThey argued that the shortfall of 35 per cent is sourced from imports which comes at a premium due to the imposition of Value Added Tax of 7.5 per cent among other added cost, leading to a sharp rise in cooking gas price.\n\nConsumers of cooking gas had in the last five months contended with the escalating price of the product, forcing many to resort to the use of dirty fuels which included; charcoal, firewood, Kerosene among others. The milestone according to NLNG is coming just three months after the Company supplied its first Propane cargo into the domestic market and has developed a scheme to sustainably supply Propane for usage in cooking gas blending as well as in agro-allied, autogas, power and petrochemical sectors of the Nigerian economy to further deepen gas utilisation in Nigeria.\n\nNLNG explained that these initiatives are designed to increase LPG availability in Nigeria, diversifying its uses and support the Federal Government\u2019s Decade of Gas initiative. NLNG is currently the highest single supplier of LPG into the domestic market, with an estimated 400,000 metric tonnes supplied in 2021.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NLNG, Dr. Philip Mshelbila, said the announcement marked the Company\u2019s strong commitment to the continued growth of the domestic LPG market and its passion to increase utilisation of one of the most versatile energy sources in the world.\n\nHe said the Company was inclined towards helping to build a strong economy based on the gas resources that Nigeria is abundantly blessed with, and that natural gas could help drive the economy by providing cooking gas for homes, supporting industrialisation, powering mobile cell sites and complex transportation systems, impacting food supply through its usage for fertilizer production and increasing power supply to both homes and industries while reducing the country\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nAccording to Mshelbila, \u201cGas, as the cleanest of the fossil fuels, has become an essential energy source to be reckoned with during this energy transition period. Other countries are revolutionising their energy industry to cut down on carbon emissions drastically. Nigeria should not be left out in this drive, considering its abundant gas resources. Gas is essential for life and living at the moment, because it can support everything we will need to develop our economy and create better living standards for Nigerians. We need to change the narrative, and NLNG is being pragmatic about it.\n\n\u201cWe are ardently following up on the commitment we made in March 2021 at the NLNG-sponsored pre-summit conference of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) 2021 organised by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources to support the Decade of Gas declaration by the Federal Government. We are driven by our vision to remain a globally competitive LNG company helping to build a better Nigeria and are making a reality of our collective dreams that one day we can switch all cooking fuels to gas, and power our vehicles with gas as encapsulated in the government\u2019s National Gas Expansion Program and the Autogas Policy,\u201d he said.",

If he is deported, however, his slot will most likely go to Russian player Andrey Rublev.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne on 6 January, after Australian border Force officials said he had \u201cfailed to provide appropriate evidence\u201d to receive a vaccine exemption.\n\nHis initial announcement that he was coming to play in the Open prompted a backlash from some Australians, who have lived under long and strict Covid lockdowns, because it was unclear if he could meet the country\u2019s strict entry rules. Melbourne in particular was hard bit by lockdowns, enduring 262 days under heavy restrictions last year.\n\nDjokovic was detained for hours at the airport\u2019s immigration control when he first arrived, and then spent days at an immigration hotel. Days later his visa was reinstated by a judge, who ordered his release, ruling that border officials ignored correct procedure when he arrived.\n\nBut on Friday evening in Melbourne, Mr Hawke cancelled Djokovic\u2019s visa under separate powers in Australia\u2019s Migration Act.\n\nThe act allows him to deport anyone he deems a potential risk to \u201cthe health, safety or good order of the Australian community\u201d, however Djokovic can still appeal this.\n\nIt comes after Djokovic addressed allegations that his agent had accidentally made a false declaration on his travel form.

          "text": "* Reveals Lagos-Ibadan, Sagamu-Benin Expressways for completion this year\n\n*Feels nostalgia for the past as young infantry officer at Lafenwa Barracks\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said yesterday in Ogun State that he had found in Governor Dapo Abiodun a politician who lived by the dictum, promise made and promise kept. Buhari stated this during a visit to the state, where he inaugurated some landmark projects. It was his first official visit to a state in the new year.\n\nAddressing the people during the inauguration of the five strategic projects, Buhari said he was proud of the governor, who also completed two federal roads in his state. He said Abiodun exemplified constructive engagement and collaboration between the federal and state governments.\n\nBuhari said the scenes at the reception ceremony organised for him and the large crowd of residents that came out to welcome him triggered in him a wave of nostalgia for his days as a young infantry officer at the Nigerian Army barracks at Lafenwa in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\nHe praised Abiodun for delivering visionary projects in the state, even in the midst of challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDescribing Abiodun as the \u201cPerforming Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State,\u201d the president maintained that the governor was a worthy example of promise made, promises kept.\n\nBuhari told Abiodun, \u201cYour Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your state and your people. You have made our great party, the APC, proud, too.\n\n\u201cYou are a worthy example of promises made, promises kept. These lofty projects could not have materialised without your huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\u201d\n\nThe projects, which the president came to inaugurate, included the Gateway City Gate, the 42-kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road, 14-kilometre Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway, and two housing estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cThis has made Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice,\u201d Buhari stated. He also told the governor, \u201cYou have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun State. You have represented our party very well.\u201d\n\nBuhari expressed delight that the 14-kilometre Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road commissioned by him had been reconstructed into a modern expressway by the state government, stating that the road would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway that the federal government is currently reconstructing.\n\nThe president said, \u201cJust across the road is the 42-kilometre Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road, which the state government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights. That road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the federal government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u201cI am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them. It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the states and federal government. These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital, to Kano, with Ogun State, having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u201d\n\nBuhari announced that the federal government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of these roads, as done for the 100-kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road. He also promised to consider the approval of the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nOn the housing programme of the state government, the president commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high-income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Project, Buhari said, \u201cIt is not just a park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the state capital at the centre point of the state.\u201d\n\nResponding to requests by the governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko roads, the president assured the people of Ogun State that the roads would receive the federal government\u2019s attention.\n\nThe federal government had previously approved the reconstruction of the 100 kilometres Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road to be handled by the Dangote Group.\n\nThe president thanked Ogun residents for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage in the state, which was his first visit to any state in the New Year.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe traditional hospitality of the people of this state has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u2018Omowale\u2019 and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters, whose goodwill I have always enjoyed.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the people of Ogun State were blessed to have such a focused, deliberate and inclusive administration under the watch of Abiodun. The president said, \u201cThe reward for success is more hard work to meet the increasing expectations of the people. When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u201d\n\nBuhari, who was bestowed with \u201chonourary indigeneship\u201d of the state, said, \u201cIt is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honourary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolised by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u201cI will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u201d\n\nIn his own remarks, the governor noted that the state had the highest number of federal roads in Nigeria. He called for the federal government\u2019s intervention to fix the roads, which he described as strategic.\n\nEarlier, Abiodun had highlighted some of the projects executed by his administration under the acronym \u201cISEYA\u201d and requested that the president, would before the end of the year, beinvited to the state to inaugurate more projects.\n\nReiterating that Ogun had highest number of federal roads in the country, Abiodun further requested that the state be accorded a Special Status for Federal Government Infrastructural Funding, especially, on roads.\n\nThe president was received by Abiodun and five other governors, namely, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos; Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Osun State Governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola; Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, and the representative of Oyo State Governor, Mr. Rauf Olaniyan.\n\nAt the reception also were Alhaji Aliko Dangote and former governors of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and Chief Segun Osoba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday said it was working with development partners to address cases of circulating mutant polio virus Type2 (cMPV2) found in some parts of the country. It blamed the cases of polio outbreak on disruptions to routine immunisation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a statement signed by Executive Director of the National Primary HealthCare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, the agency stated that it had already acquired new tools and resources to ensure the outbreak of polio was contained through robust outbreak responses using the novel Oral Polio Vaccine (nOPV2).\n\nHe said the vaccine had been shown to be effective in halting the spread of the cMPV2.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAll 36 states and FCT have completed at least one nOPV2 Outbreak Response (OBR). Several other rounds of the OBR as well as other campaigns to improve the mucosal immunity of children aged o-5 years old using Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV) have also been planned for this year. Efforts are also being ramped up to increase routine immunisation coverage beyond pre-COVID values,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib who said the attention of NPHCDA and development partners was drawn to some media reports, (not THISDAY) claiming that there was an outbreak of a new polio virus in some states.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, no case of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) has been reported anywhere in the country since the last case in 2016. We currently have 395 cases of Circulating Mutant Poliovirus Type 2 (cMPV2) across 27 states and the FCT.\n\n\u201cNigeria and the African region were certified Wild Polio Virus (WPV) free in 2020, following a rigorous verification and certification process by the African Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (ARCC) which spanned three years of no detection of WPV. Till date, there has been no case of WPV anywhere in the country.\u201d\n\nShuaib said the cMPV2 outbreaks were caused by immunity gaps in children due to several reasons, including low routine immunisation coverage, and missing children during immunisation campaigns.\n\nHe further said the suspension of several polio campaigns and other health programmes in 2020, as well as disruptions to routine immunisation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, created further immunity gaps which led to new and wider outbreaks, and further increased transmission of the circulating mutant poliovirus both globally and within Nigeria.\n\nShuaib added that the virus thrived in areas with poor sanitation, open defecation, and inadequate access to clean drinking water.\n\nAccording to him, these condition allows the virus to be easily transmitted from one person to another through contaminated water and poor sewage disposal.\n\nThe NPHCDA boss said malnutrition occasioned by increasing poverty was also a predisposing factor in exposed children.\n\nHe then, \u201cThese non-wild polio viruses which originated because of normal changes in the reproduction of viruses in the environment are not as virulent as WPV and are also being reported in many other countries.\n\n\u201cNPHCDA assures Nigerians that the agency and partners will continue to conduct surveillance and vaccination campaigns to prevent and contain any possible importation of the Wild Polio Virus into the country.\n\n\u201cWe use this opportunity to reiterate the importance of parents and caregivers bringing their children for routine immunisation against vaccine preventable diseases.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: Pan-African Settlement Platform Will Reduce Dollar, Other FX Usage in Africa",
          "text": "*New payment system to save continent $5bn annual forex outflow launched\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele has said the newly launched Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) will simplify cross-border trade and reduce the heavy dependence on the US dollars, Pounds and Euro intra-African trade.\n\nEmefiele said this yesterday in Accra, Ghana, during the launch of PAPSS.\n\nPAPSS is a cross-border financial market infrastructure enabling payment transactions across Africa, bridging trade challenges in a continent with over 41 known currencies. It is expected to boost intra-African trade by transforming and facilitating payment, clearing and settlement for cross-border trade across Africa.\n\nPAPSS provides the solution to the disconnected and fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems that had long impeded intra-African trade.\n\nThe Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), in collaboration with African Union (AU) and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), officially launched the platform for commercial use.\n\nThe CBN governor described the PAPPS as a breakthrough achievement for the continent, saying it would help facilitate trade and enhance payment gateway across West Africa.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the new payment solution would contribute towards formalising trade in the continent, adding that it would be beneficial to households, firms and financial institutions in the continent.\n\nHe estimated that intra-African trade would increase to 35 per cent, from 15 per cent in the next five years with infrastructure provided by PAPSS.\n\nHe also pointed out that with growing pace of digitalisation in financial services, the PAPSS could serve as a viable platform for supporting e-commerce in the continent.\n\n\u201cBusinesses can be assured of an efficient and reliable payment gateway that supports the instant flow of funds and relatively the use of safe payment channels that usually comes at a high cost to households and businesses.\n\n\u201cPrior to the launch of PAPSS, settlements for intra Africa trade required a third currency and a non-African correspondent bank. This resulted in an estimated loss of close to $5 billion annually and undermined trade in Africa countries.\n\n\u201cThe launch of PAPPS gives the fresh opportunity and aspiration for the African continent. It will simplify cross-border transactions, reduce third currencies for intra-African transactions and remove the need for correspondent banks and ultimately amplify intra trade significantly.\n\n\u201cCBN will ensure the financial institutions under its jurisdiction accept PAPSS and recommend it to businesses across Nigeria,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nGhana\u2019s President, Nana Akufo-Addo, who was represented by the country\u2019s Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia hosted and presided over the commercial launch of the PAPSS, saying that the platform would save Africa more than $5 billion annually in payment transaction costs, while it plays an increasingly significant role in accelerating the continent\u2019s transactions underpinning the operationalisation of the AfCFTA.\n\nAkufo-Addo complimented Afreximbank and AfCFTA Secretariat for establishing the payment system, citing PAPSS as a major leap in releasing the continent from overdependence on external players and factors in achieving a long yearned-for acceleration in intra-continental trade and investment.\n\n\u201cThis launch is a result of many months of hard work, resolve and commitment towards achieving set objectives for the growth of the continent in trade. All Central Banks in Africa must now join up and ensure seamless transfer of funds deploying this most practical and important African solution to an African problem,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his comment, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah said: \u201cWe are eager to build upon the African Continental Free Trade Area\u2019s creation of a single market throughout Africa, and PAPSS provides the state-of-the-art financial market infrastructure connecting African markets to each other thereby enabling instant cross-border payments in respective local African currencies for cross-border trade. \u201cAfreximbank as the main Settlement Agent for PAPSS, provides settlement guarantees on the payment system and overdraft facilities to all settlement agents, in partnership with Africa\u2019s participating Central Banks. \u201cPAPSS will effectively eliminate Africa\u2019s financial borders, formalise and integrate Africa\u2019s payment systems, and play a major role in facilitating and accelerating the huge AfCFTA-induced growth curve in intra-African trade.\u201d\n\nThe event was graced by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria and Chairman of the IAFTA Advisory Council, and Mahamadou Issoufou \u2013 former President of Republic of Niger who is acknowledged as a champion in driving the establishment of the AfCTA Initiative.\n\nIn his presentation, PAPSS CEO Mr. Mike Ogbalu emphasised that the payment system was not designed to compete with or replace existing payment systems, but to facilitate the connectivity level that brings all payments systems together into one network that is interoperable, efficient and affordable.\n\n\u201cPAPSS is designed to make our currencies regain value to domesticate intra-Africa payments in this journey towards African prosperity, while providing the superhighway which connects others to reach every part of this continent as we seek to create the Africa that We Want.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the AfCFTA Secretary General H.E Wamkele Mene appreciated the role and commitment of the Continent\u2019s Heads of States and Governments through the African Union, saying their strong political will continue to be the bedrock of progress towards a full implementation of AfCFTA.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

          "text": "Nigerian companies are planning to borrow more from the capital market in 2022 as a blend of old and new issuers size up the opportunity presented by relatively low-interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe pipeline for Q1\u2019 2022 is already quite strong, as it was in 2020 and 2021. Prospective issuers are predominantly repeated issuers, but we are seeing some first-time issuers coming to the fore,\u201d notes Akintunde Majekodunmi, CEO of credit rating agency, GCR.\n\n\u201cThe key determinant to the debt capital raising activities of Nigerian corporates remains prevailing yields, and currently yields are supportive of continued debt issuance,\u201d Majekodunmi says.\n\nThere has been no debt raising activity yet, 13 days into the New Year, but that will change in the coming weeks, according to Majekodunmi. Companies have eclipsed the N1 trillion mark in the past two years, an all-time high.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, issuances have achieved long tenors and relatively affordable rates and, as a result, corporates are chasing these opportunities into 2022,\u201d Majekodunmi states, noting, \u201cHowever, elections in 2023 and changes to tax regulation may put some downward pressure on issuance but not enough to outweigh the aforementioned.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nigeria, debt and productivity\n\nGlobally, companies have made a brisk start to 2022, raising more than $100 billion on the bond market in the first week of this year, as finance chiefs kicked off an effort to lock in low borrowing costs before benchmark interest rates start to climb.\n\nGlobal corporate bond issuance reached $101 billion in the year to January 7, with US deals reaching a record pace.\n\nThe global haul trailed only a blockbuster $118 billion start to 2021, which was the highest on Refinitiv records going back 19 years.\n\nThe corporate bond market typically revs up at the start of the year after a sleepy period around the holidays in late December. But the rush of new deals offers an early glimpse at the barrage of issuance expected early this year, as companies look to tap debt markets before major central banks begin raising short-term interest rates, something that increases the cost of borrowing across the economy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank is also under pressure to raise interest rates as global rates rise, which means that the current low-interest rates in the country may not last too long.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already advised emerging economies including Nigeria to raise interest rates and even allow their currencies to weaken in response to rising global interest rates led by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.\n\n\u201cIt could be a case of now or never for Nigerian corporates looking to tap the capital market at favourable conditions,\u201d a pan-African fund manager told BusinessDay. \u201cIf interest rates start to rise and Nigeria is forced to increase rates, it becomes more expensive to raise money,\u201d the fund manager said.",

          "text": "Systems that capture energy and store it for later use, either to supply power to an off-grid application or to complement a peak demand, are the emerging energy sector investment frontier, but Nigeria is staking a claim.\n\nInvestment dollars are shifting from large-scale utilities for battery-based energy storage systems since Tesla provided a proof of concept for the commercialisation of electric cars and advanced battery technology.\n\nNigeria\u2019s battery manufacturing market is ennobled by imports from China and India. Its biggest battery manufacturing plant, Union Autoparts Mfg. Co. Limited, in Nnewi, Anambra State, lies desolate. Batteries used in power back-up systems are mostly imported or assembled in Nigeria.\n\nLocal recyclers extracting lead ingots from discarded lead-acid batteries from vehicles pose a threat to the environment, as their processes are poorly monitored and regulated.\n\nBatteries used in Nigeria are mostly for automotive and inverters adopted as an alternative backup to electric power. In recent times, the market has seen advancements in batteries such as polymers of lithium or a combination of lithium with other chemicals to improve durability.\n\nThere is also a growing demand for batteries smartphone and laptop batteries and electronic devices. Some companies are also venturing into the electric vehicle battery industry.\n\nAnalysts at Data Bridge Market Research say the Nigeria battery market is growing with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3 percent in the forecast period of 2020 to 2027 and is expected to reach $119.65 million by 2027 mostly through increasing adoption at the household level.\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have huge opportunities and potential and are seen to be flourishing in the coming decade, creating new opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s battery market,\u201d the researchers say.\n\nHowever, the use case for large-scale battery storage is glaringly obvious in Nigeria. From food preservation to local clinics, and rural electrification and small businesses, power storage systems should factor significantly in government\u2019s policy plans.\n\nFor example, a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, commissioned by Shell-seeded off-grid energy investment firm, All On, found that Nigeria loses about 80 million tons of food annually along the value chain including production, wholesale, retail, and consumption equivalent to 9 percent of its GDP, due to lack of cold storage facilities.\n\nGlobally, battery storage is attracting massive financing. Overall investment in battery storage increased by almost 40 percent in 2020, to $5.5 billion, said Paris-based International Energy Association (IEA). Other market forecasts say it could grow between $12 billion and $16 billion by 2025.\n\nRead also: Global oil, gas investment projected to grow by $26bn in 2022\n\nIn the IEA\u2019s Net-Zero by 2050 Scenario, forecasts that total installed battery capacity would need to expand by 35-fold between 2020 and 2030 to 585GW. It imagines that over 120GW of battery storage capacity is added in 2030, up from 5GW in 2020, implying an average annual growth rate of 38 percent.\n\nAll over the world, governments, businesses, and nonprofits are drawing up strategies to grab a piece of what is shaping to become a juicy pie and Africa, especially Nigeria, where over 80 million people without access to electricity should not be caught napping.\n\nThe largest markets for stationary energy storage in 2030 are projected to be in North America (41.1GWh), China (32.6GWh), and Europe (31.2GWh). Excluding China, Japan (2.3GWh) and South Korea (1.2GWh) comprise a large part of the rest of the Asian market, notes a report by the United States Department of Energy on Energy Storage Grand Challenge.\n\nExperts say increasing demand for continuous power and energy storage systems in critical infrastructures, adoption of grid energy storage solutions, grid modernisation efforts, and increasing usage of lithium-ion battery-based energy storage systems due to its excellent features are among the factors driving the market for battery energy storage systems.\n\nAlready, major oil companies are training their focus on energy storage systems. Shell, last year, published its transition to Net-Zero emissions, which relies heavily on investments in clean energy and energy storage technologies.\n\nTotalEnergies has launched the largest battery-based energy storage facility in France, which has a power capacity of 61mw and a total storage capacity of 61-megawatt hours (MWh).\n\n\u201cWith the success of this project, TotalEnergies intends to deploy its storage solutions in countries where the company is actively developing renewable energies,\u201d said Vincent Stoquart, senior vice president, renewables, at TotalEnergies.\n\nThe US strategy report identifies seven energy storage technologies to focus upon including Lithium-ion batteries, Lead-acid batteries, and pumped storage hydropower.\n\nOthers are Compressed-air energy storage (CAES), Redox flow batteries (RFBs), Hydrogen (H2), and Building thermal energy storage (TES) \u2013 Ice.\n\nLead-acid batteries are prevalent in Nigeria used in cars, home inverter solutions, and most renewable energy projects including home system solutions. The adoption of Lithium-ion batteries is only just gaining ground but it is still expensive even if it delivers superior value.\n\nOther storage systems are not in existence and industry professionals are pushing to kickstart hydrogen adoption in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHydrogen holds real potential for Nigeria\u2019s economy and it\u2019s time we begin to harness it,\u201d says Godwin Aigbokhan, head, Competence Centre Energy and Environment at the German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria.",

          "title": "FG assures Nigerians of adequate provision of ICT equipment for students, citizens",
          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Federal Government has assured it will continue to equip students and citizens with ICT skills such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to facilitate ICT adoption in teaching and learning in order to prepare them for a future that will be strictly driven by technology.\n\nThe Federal Government gave the assurance at the commissioning of the Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC) by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, who represented President Muhammadu Buahri, GCFR, at the event which held at Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Ilesa, State of Osun, on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am aware that the programme was conceptualized to promote the availability and utilisation of ICT and resources of the Internet in teaching and learning in public schools in underserved, unserved and rural areas. In order words, this Digital Nigeria Centre has been designed to promote the connection of public secondary schools to broadband internet in Ilesa community, and the goal is to equip beneficiaries with 21st Century skills,\u201d Aregbesola said.\n\n\u201cMore concretely, the specific objectives of Digital Nigeria Centre include; increasing ICT literacy among school teachers and students, providing a platform for accessing online educational resources, equiping students with ICT skills, facilitating ICT adoption in teaching and learning and ultimately to increase pass rate in mathematics, English language and other science subjects.\u201d\n\nIn his speech titled, Digital Skills and Literacy for Jobs and Social Inclusion, the Minister described the thorough and timely execution of the project as significant and commendable, noting that it prepares Nigerians in advance with digital skill and literacy for a future that will soon be driven strictly by technology, saying some major auto makers have decided to stop the production of combustion engines in the next 40 years.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, at least six major automakers, including Ford, Mercedes Benz, General Motors and Volvo joined the governments of 30 countries in November last year to pledge to stop the production and sales of internal combustion engine cars by 2040.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that even a mechanic should be ICT compliant. Any mechanic that can\u2019t use ICT tools will find himself out of job. Indeed, in the next 20 years, anyone not ICT compliant may not be part of humanity again, considering that it will be impossible to function and interact with other humans,\u201d Ogbeni Aregbesola stated.\n\nThe Minister, also noted that the project is also a testament to the unwavering commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to deploying technology to better the citizens\u2019 quality of life and experience, saying It also goes to emphasise the preeminent role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for improving standards of living as a people.\n\n\u201cI would like to express my profound gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for his relentless commitment in ensuring delivery of gains of democratic order to the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo him, the welfare of Nigerians, especially our teaming youths remains a top priority for this administration. The continuous benefits the country has been deriving from effectively leveraging ICT to run governance more efficiently has been phenomenal,\u201d the Minister remarked.\n\nThe minister said according to a 2018 report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), titled: Digital Skills Critical for Jobs and Social Inclusion, major technology breakthroughs in next 10 years will impact forms of work and the structure of labour markets as well as other aspects of life such as education, health, and agriculture.\n\n\u201cFrom a skills development perspective, the implications of technological change are expected to be profound, both for the re-skilling and up-skilling of our adults and for the education of the youth and children.\n\n\u201cIn this context, developing capacities for anticipating the changing needs for digital skills for work and life is crucial for all countries and that should be of interest to all of us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Communication Commission, Prof. Adeolu Akande, stated that the DNC centre will no doubt help in fast-tracking the acquisition of digital skills required for the implementation of the digital economy drive of the Federal Government especially to the younger generation.\n\nProf. Pantami added that the digital skills which are a range of abilities and aptitudes required by users of digital devices, communication applications, and networks to access and manage information will also in-turn boost National Security and enhance National Growth and Progress.\n\nThe Governor the State of Osun, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola represented at the event by his Commissioner for Innovation, Science and Technology, Dr. Babatunde Olawale opined that Nigeria cannot be left behind by the digital revolution of the world noting that his administration also focuses on building a sustainable economy through e-government which is government is grateful to the Federal Government for siting the DNC project in Osun.\n\nResponding to the gesture of the Federal Government, the Principal, Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Mrs. Ramota Ilesanmi, thanked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Government for selecting the school for the project saying it will go a long way in meeting the ICT needs of not only the students, but select residents of the city.\n\nThe representative of the president subsequently announced the establishment of President Muhammadu Buhari N100 million Technology Empowerment Fund to create world class technology experts, targeting 2000 youths in the next two years in Ijesaland who will be provided with devices for training in different areas such as software development and design, amongst others.\n\nThe Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC) is a project facilitated through the Universal Service Provision Fund of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) under the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy.\n\nIn attendance at the event were, the Senator Representing Osun West, Sen. Adelere Oriolowo; Speaker of the State of Osun House of Assembly, Represented by Hon. Wake Adedoyin, Federal Commissioner of the Nigeria Population Commission, Sen.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has applauded the current National Assembly and particularly the leadership style of it\u2019s chairman, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari\u2019s message was delivered by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari at a birthday get-together hosted Wednesday night by the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in honour of Lawan who clocked 63 on Wednesday.\n\nKalu and Lawan have been close friends since their school days at the University of Maiduguri in the early 80s.\n\nProfessor Gambari said the President sent him to deliver a congratulatory message and express his admiration about Lawan\u2019s personal achievements.\n\n\u201cThe third dimension of Mr President\u2019s message is to commend the celebrant for the very able manner in which he has steered the affairs of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSome people assumed that the role of the Legislative arm of government is to oppose government. That is not the President\u2019s understanding.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is an arm of government just as the Executive is. Just as the Judiciary is. That means the three arms of government are to work in a complimentary manner.\n\n\u201cTherefore Mr President view the kind of flare, the commitment, the passion, the constructive engagement with the Executive under his leadership, the cooperation with the Executive as a sign, not of weakness but strength.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to be critical. It is easy to be negative but it is a lot more difficult and more challenging to have a constructive engagement and cooperation with the Executive. But the beneficiary of such constructive engagement and cooperation is the nation.\n\n\u201cOne of the achievements is that we now have a budget that runs from January to December and Mr President has just signed the finance bill and budget for 2022.\n\n\u201cSo the President really commends the way in which he handles the affairs of the National Assembly and looks forward to many more periods of cooperation with your leadership,\u201d Professor Gambari said.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, the Senate President passionately appealed to politicians irrespective of their political affiliations to work towards building consensus on critical national issues.\n\n\u201cPoliticians across board must learn to arrive and achieve and sustain consensus on issues. Our country first. You can\u2019t be President, you can\u2019t be Senator, you can\u2019t be member of House of Representatives, you can\u2019t be Governor, you can\u2019t be anything unless there is a country.\n\n\u201cSo we must build and sustain a consensus on certain fundamental issues about our country, irreduceable minimum below which nobody should go.\n\n\u201cWhether you are PDP or APC or APGA or whatever you are, because that will infringe on the very fabric of our country. So it is very important that we achieve that. Democratic countries elsewhere that are successful have largely achieved those kind of consensus.\n\n\u201cWhether you are Party A or Party B, if you are voted into office, there are certain things you cannot afford to do. Political capital can be made from anything but certainly not those kind of issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the opportunity today to appeal to all of us, politicians across the country, across board, to work for our country to achieve consensus on certain fundamental issues.\n\n\u201cOur people look up to us.

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammad Buhari on Thursday, visited Ogun State where he commissioned some monumental projects constructed by the governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nThe president on his arrival in the State first commissioned the Ijebu-Ode-Epe Road and other four projects located in different parts of the State.\n\nThe president was received by Prince Abiodun, and five other governors, including Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Osun State governor, Alhaj Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, as well as a representative of Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, Engr Rauf Olaniyan.\n\nAlso on ground was Alh Aliko Dangote and former Governor of the State Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Chief Segun Osoba, among others.\n\nAddressing residents of the state, the president heaped praises on Governor Dapo Abiodun, for delivering visionary and trail-blazing projects for the people, even in the midst of prevailing and challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDescribing Abiodun as the \u2018\u2018performing Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State,\u2019\u2019 the President said he is a worthy example of \u2018\u2018promises made, promises kept.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President noted that the lofty projects: the Gateway City Gate; the 42-Kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road; the 14km Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway and two Housing Estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta, respectively, could not have materialised without the state government\u2019s huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\n\n\u2018\u2018This has made Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u2018\u2018You (Prince Abiodun) have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun State. You have represented our Party very well.\u201d\n\nThe President expressed delight that the 14km Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road commissioned by him has been reconstructed into a modern expressway by the State government.\n\nHe noted that the impressive road would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway that the Federal Government is currently reconstructing, which is also due for commissioning this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Just across the road is the 42-kilometer Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road which the state Government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights.\n\n\u2018\u2018That road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the Federal Government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the States and Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2018These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the housing programme of the Ogun Governor, the President commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Project, the Nigerian leader said \u2018\u2018it is not just a Park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the State Capital at the centre point of the State.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that the project is also iconic, depicting the joining of hands for building the future of Ogun State in togetherness.\n\n\u2018\u2018Your Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your State and your people.\n\n\u2018\u2018You have made our great Party, the APC, proud too. You are a worthy example of promises made, promises kept,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018These lofty projects could not have materialised without your huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\u2019\u2019\n\nResponding to requests by the state governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko Roads respectively, the President assured the people of Ogun State that these roads will receive Federal Government attention.\n\nThe President announced that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of these roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road.\n\nSimilarly, the President promised to consider the approval of the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nThe President thanked the residents of the State for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage in the Gateway State.\n\n\u2018\u2018This welcome by the large crowd brings back the nostalgia of my first arrival on this soil as a young infantry officer in the Nigerian Army at the then Lafenwa Barracks in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\n\u2018\u2018The traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u2018Omowale\u2019 and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President also congratulated the people of Ogun State for having such a focused, deliberate and inclusive administration under the watch of Prince Abiodun, urging them to continue to support the governor for the successful implementation of the \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda of his Administration.\n\n\u2018\u2018The reward for success is more hardwork to meet the increasing expectations of the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, who was bestowed with \u2018\u2018honourary indigeneship\u2019\u2019 of the state, said: \u2018\u2018It is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honorary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolized by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u2018\u2018I will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier, Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun while speaking at the grand reception of the President, thanked him for the visit, saying that all the projects and programmes of his administration in the State are deliberate and guided by the vision to give Ogun State a focused and qualitative governance and create an enabling environment for a Public Private Sector Partnership to thrive.\n\nHe said his administration believe in the socio-economic development of the State and individual prosperity of its people.\n\nSpeaking on the five projects commissioned by the President, Prince Abiodun said \u201cthe choice of the five projects that we are commissioning today from our many landmark projects was a daunting task. These are just a few of our achievements. We have so much more to showcase. These selected few that Your Excellency will commission are however symbolic of the various types of projects across all sectors of our dear State\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said his \u201cAdministration in Ogun State has continued to fulfil all its promises to the people within the available means.\n\n\u2018It is noteworthy that all our projects have the inputs and are informed by the needs of the people as expressed by them at different engagement fora that we provide.\n\n\u201cThis is because we anchor our \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda on inclusiveness, equity, fairness, transparency, accountability, justice, and obedience to the rule of law. Under our FIVE Development Pillars with the acronym I.S.E.Y.A; that is I \u2013 for Infrastructure, S \u2013 for Social Welfare and Wellbeing, E \u2013 for Education, Y \u2013 for Youth Empowerment, A for Agriculture and Food Security, we based our choices on what the people say they want and we get their buy-in for implementation.\n\nWhile going through the importance of the roads, Ogun Governor said \u201cthe five projects is an iconic monument that not only beautifies the environment, but a reflection of the new approach to governance in the State. It symbolizes the convergence, harmony, and unity amongst all the groups and sections of the State. It is not just a physical Intersection of the three Senatorial Districts; it is a symbol of the togetherness of our people and the legendary warmth and hospitality to our visitors and guests.\n\n\u201cThe Ijebu-Ode-Epe Road, a Federal Road which Your Excellency commissioned earlier, is another strategic arterial road that links the Lekki / Epe corridor of Lagos State to the eastern corridor of Ogun State at Ijebu- Ode. With this road, socio-economic activities in the South East and South South zones of our country will receive a boost through the linkage of the road to Sagamu-Benin Expressway for easier access by motorists to Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest economy,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nHe noted further that, \u201cthe Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road is 42km in length and is the main arterial road that leads to our Capital City. It is a dual carriageway with streetlights, median and other road furniture. This road, though a federal road, was redesigned and reconstructed to address the daily challenges being experienced by commuters, and to make commuting between the State Capital and other parts of the State and, indeed, the rest of the country a safe, secure and pleasant experience.\n\n\u201cTwo of our many housing projects, Housing Estate at Kobape in Abeokuta comprises of 526 units of 2 and 3-bedroom bungalows. The King\u2019s Court at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta is a middle/high income Housing Estate and has 31 of its 85 units in the first phase fully completed. The remaining 54 units are at various stages of completion.\u201d",

We are optimistic that the court outings of Onyendu would be impressive. Onyendu himself is in high spirit.\n\n\u201cOur discussions with him further reassured him and strengthened his determination to persevere unrelentingly. I declare to you, Umuchineke, that Onyendu is fully prepared to appear in court as from January 18 2022. He is rooting for victory and knows that, with the help of Chukwuokike Abiama, victory is assured.\n\n\u201cYou will all behold with your eyes an interesting dimension in the harmonised workable formula we have evolved. The detractors of Onyendu will be comprehensively humbled and permanently put to shame.\n\nFurther, Onyendu utilized the opportunity afforded by our visit to mandate us to admonish his teeming supporters and followers.\n\n\u201cHe advises those of them that would appear in court in demonstration of their unflinching support and loyalty to him to conduct themselves with decorum, be civil in their conduct and comportment, shun violence and deviant behaviour in any manner or form, and exercise restraint in speech.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we have caused formal correspondences to issue on responsible, sovereign, democratic governments and other international institutions to prevail on the Nigerian government to caution uncouth and overzealous security agents.\n\n\u201cWe can authoritatively declare to you, Umuchineke, that those correspondences are receiving the requisite attention they deserve. We are optimistic that there would be a positive transformation in the conduct and general approach of the said overzealous security agents at the next appearance of Onyendu in Court.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to state for the umpteenth time that Onyendu has not committed any offence known to law. For this reason, he must be released unconditionally.\n\n\u201cWe specially appeal to you, Umuchineke, to demonstrate profound understanding and fortitude in these trying times. You must remain focused, dogged, and resilient. On no account must your untiring spirit be shaken and your resolve diluted.\n\n\u201cYou must keep the peace at all times and comport yourselves with decorum. In no too distant time, you will surely savour the sweetness of victory. Celebration and jollity will resound in your respective dwellings and sorrow and sighing shall take a permanent and unremitting flight to the abyss.\n\n\u201cOnyendu expresses his profound gratitude and appreciation to millions of his followers and supporters scattered throughout the face of the earth. He declares to them never to lose hope but to hold steadfastly to that one thing that is dear to them. He promises them that with the help of Chukwuokike Abiama the present distraction would soon pass and that victory and celebration would be their lot.\u201d\n\nAlthough there has been no official statement about where and how Kanu was apprehended by INTERPOL in Kenya on June 27, 2021, his relatives and lawyers have described how he was taken into custody in Kenya under dubious circumstances and extradited to Nigeria, where he is currently facing terrorism charges before Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja.",

I even said this openly that we will not spend money but I am also saying it openly now that we have had to spend money, we were forced to spend money.\n\n\u201cWhen our children spent one month and did not come and these bandits were telling us that they will start killing our children one by one, then we had to weigh between our money being in our pockets and our children dying or our children been released to us and we losing our money so, preferred to lose the money since the government will not help us we had to resort to self-help, that was what happened and we had to spend so much money.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in our minds, there is no one that convinces many of us that this administration has done enough on security. We are not saying that they have done nothing, they have been saying that they are doing their best but we are saying that their best is below the belt, far below our expectations.\n\n\u201cWhoever is going to be the next president of Nigeria must be ready to confront the insecurity in our land. For as long as some people are free to be carrying guns and be killing people while others are arrested for carrying the same thing, then there is a problem of injustice in the land.\n\n\u201cArrest is discriminatory, you can see clearly in Nigeria, you don\u2019t need to be told that someone like me will still be hiding and not saying the truth, it is a shame on the entire nation. At this level, we must say the truth to ourselves, the insecurity of this nation has been propelled by the high level of impunity.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Female officer violated extant military laws \u2013 Army \u2026 Laws discriminatory \u2013 Women group \u2026Military should\u2019ve promoted the love story \u2013 Omokri \u2018\u2026Nigeria not under military dictatorship\u2019\n\nAlthough Private Hannah Sofiyat Akinlabi, the female soldier who was detained for accepting a marriage proposal from a male member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Kwara state simply identified as Remi, has been released, the dust generated by her detention is yet to settle. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines some of the challenges faced by women in uniforms.\n\nHer release\n\nA source in the army had disclosed that the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, pleaded with the military authorities to pardon her in the spirit of the Christmas season.\n\nHe said Gen. Yahaya made overtures to the leadership of the armed forces, requesting that the soldier be pardoned. But despite the intervention, the COAS maintained that the erring soldier should be strongly reprimanded against engaging in any kind of act that contravenes the military code of conduct for its officers and men.\n\n\u201cLt.-Gen. Yahaya\u2019s \u2018appeal for mercy\u2019 for the female soldier may not be unconnected with the fact that the Christmas season presents an opportunity for persons who erred to be given clemency.\n\n\u201cThe Military authorities have considered the appeal of the Army Chief and ordered the release of the soldier to enjoy Christmas with family and friends,\u201d the source said.\n\nImmigration officers too\n\nSimilarly, three female officers of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) were in 2020 queried for partaking in Bopdaddychallenge (a trending dance competition on social media).\n\nAccording to the query letter shared by OluwaseunOwosobi, the founder of Stand to End Rape Initiative, the female officers were accused of indecent flaunting of their bodies and desecration of the NIS uniform in the video.\n\nThe letter stated that their action was serious misconduct liable to dismissal from service. The erring officers were asked to give reasons a disciplinary action shouldn\u2019t be taken against them.\n\nThey had shot a 57-second video to participate in a social media trend. Three of the officers were identified as Priscilla Irabor, Catherine Bakura and Blessing Udida.\n\nIn the video, the officers wore their uniforms, switching to mufti at every 12 to 15 seconds interval while dancing to \u2018Bop Daddy,\u2019 a recent song by Nigerian rapper Falz.\n\nA similar video uploaded on YouTube showed American service members changing their outfits while a soundtrack \u2018Don\u2019t Rush\u2019 played in the background. The officers did not face any disciplinary action by the authorities.\n\nBut the NIS in a query letter said the video \u201chas caused a lot of embarrassment to the NIS and in line with our standard as a paramilitary organisation is considered scandalous and an act unbecoming of an Officer and therefore a violation of Public Service Rule (PSR) 030401 and 030402.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a serious misconduct liable to dismissal from Service.\u201d\n\nThe officers were asked to present themselves to the authorities \u201cwithin 72 hours on receipt of the letter, why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for violation of the following: Immoral Behaviour, Sabotage and any other act unbecoming of a public officer.\u201d\n\nArmy lists offence\n\nExplaining why it arrested and detained Sofiyat, Army spokesman Brig.-Gen. OnyemaNwachukwu said the female officer violated extant military laws by getting involved in a public display of relationship with a paramilitary trainee, a corps member.\n\nHe added that the female officer violated the Nigerian Army\u2019s rules and regulations guiding the codes of conduct of military personnel when deployed for duty.\n\nAccording to him, Sofiyat violated some rules of the Nigerian Army, including indulging in an amorous relationship with a trainee; indulging in romance while in uniform; disobeying the Armed Forces standing guidelines and directives for the use of social media, among others.\n\nDefence\n\nHowever, a member of Sofiyat family who spoke to a national daily said she was shocked and joyful when she got the proposal for marriage and that was why she reacted the way she did.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the matter, the close family member said Sofiyat and Remi had lost each other\u2019s contacts, but were surprisingly brought together by fate at the NYSC camp late November.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have known each other before they got to camp. They met in Abeokuta over three years ago before she joined the Army, but lost contact sometime ago. So, their meeting at the NYSC camp was like a re-union.\n\n\u201cThey have been friends all along and Remi thought it wise to seize the opportunity of their meeting again to propose to her. He had to walk up to her as a man and not worry about her new status as a soldier because she would eventually get married. He got the courage and proposed to her with a ring which she accepted. The whole thing was totally a surprise to her.\n\n\u201cIt happened after the passing out parade on December 14, 2021. She was at the Mammy Market pressing her phone, she was just on her own and she never knew something of such would happen.\n\n\u201cWhen he walked up to her, she was over joyous and dumbfounded at the same time. She is a lady and her reactions were triggered by emotions. Like men, women are still emotional beings no matter who they are.\n\n\u201cRemi was not holding any phone and did not record the moment. He didn\u2019t post anything on social media and she didn\u2019t also post it on social media. It was the fellow corps members that did the posting on social media.\u201d\n\nLawyers\u2019 take\n\nIn a chat with this reporter, a former chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Barrister Chibuzor Felix, faulted the military authorities for the treatment meted out to Sofiyat.\n\nHe stated that it was imperative to remind leaders of these institutions that Nigeria was not under any military dictatorship, but under civilian democracy.\n\nHe also condemned the operations of the military in recent times, particularly with the way it illegally detained citizens for an indiscriminate number of days with scant or no regard to the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nHe stated that it was imperative to remind leaders of these institutions that Nigeria was not under any military dictatorship but under civilian democracy since 1999; that the provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended, particularly Chapter 4, guarantee the right to personal liberty, right to a fair hearing, right to dignity, right to movement among others.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen one thought that we have seen the worst concerning Cute Abiola\u2019s case, yet another wild \u2018drama\u2019 in terms of brazen violation of a right of a citizen happened to one Private Hannah Sofiyat who accepted a marriage proposal from a male corps member.\n\n\u201cThe institution implicated here is the Nigerian military authority. Again, this young female officer is said to have violated military rules and regulations. She was detained after video clips of her being proposed to by a male corps member at the National Youth Service Corps orientation camp in Yikpata, Kwara state, went viral on social media. One Captain M.M. Abdullahi, Kwara state NYSC Camp Commandant was alleged to have ordered her detention in the detention facility in Ilorin pending further investigations.\n\n\u201cPart of the offence she is allegedly guilty of includes but not limited to an amorous relationship with a trainee, not yet eligible for marriage as she was expected to have served for three years before she can qualify for marriage and romancing while in army uniform plus other sundry offences.\n\n\u201cWhilst one cannot interrogate the rights of these agencies to maintain discipline in their organisations, one is astonished at the alacrity with which these citizens are thrown into illegal detention for an indiscriminate number of days with scant or no regard to the provisions of the constitution that guarantees several basic rights to the citizens including those who serve these security institutions.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cIn case those who are in the leadership of these institutions have forgotten or are not in the know, may we remind them that we are not under any military dictatorship but under civilian democracy since 1999. The provisions of the 1999 constitution as amended, particularly Chapter 4, guarantees right to personal liberty, right to fair hearing, right to dignity, right to movement etc. These rights are in existence and have not been abrogated.\n\n\u201cNo one today can be punished for any crime in Nigeria that is not properly defined by our Criminal or Penal Code. If these citizens who are employees of these institutions have committed any crime or breached any of their administrative rules or regulations, we demand fair, transparent and open trial process in accordance with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which is the ground norm of our jurisprudence. Anything short of that is unacceptable, illegal, and remains questionable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a lawyer Kabiru Sanni, criticised the military for detaining a personnel just for accepting a marriage proposal.\n\n\u201cThe human rights community finds it difficult to accept the fact that a citizen can be taken hostage in an opaque manner and it has to take some days before the authorities could confirm that they are the one holding the citizen hostage in their facility.\n\n\u201cSo also is the idea of throwing a young military officer into detention simply because she accepted a marriage proposal which is approved by God and laws of the land.\n\n\u201cAssuming but not conceding that she breached any of their regulations, can she not be punished without throwing her into detention for an indefinite period? \u201cWhat makes her marriage acceptance too offensive that warrants these draconian measures meted out to her? Can\u2019t our leaders and institutions sometimes play the role of \u2018God\u2019 just as we see in other countries in forgiving people when their error is not too grave to affect national interest? Has the country descended into fascism and dictatorship where leaders are banishing joy, happiness and smiles as if we are in North Korea? Is Nigeria now the Banana Republic?\u201d\n\nOmokri\u2019s take\n\nLikewise, a Nigerian socio-political activist, Reno Omokri, lambasted the Nigerian Army for poor handling of the Sofiyat case.\n\nIn a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, Reno said the Nigerian Army \u201cshould have promoted the love story as a recruitment tool\u201d to build more morale.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian Army, which is currently rehabilitating Boko Haram, is penalising Private Hannah Sofiyat for accepting a proposal from a corps member; is that not madness?\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army should have promoted the love story as a recruitment tool. They should have brought in the cameras and celebrated the couple. It would have built morale. But instead, they chose to punish love!\u201d\n\nDiscrimination\n\nMeanwhile, a group, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA), in a petition, noted that Sofyiyat has not contravened the regulation on the restriction of marriage for three years.\n\nIn the petition signed by FunmiFalana to the Chief of Army Staff, Farouk Yahaya, WELA stated that the restriction of female military personnel from contracting any marriage for three years upon enlistment, which is not applicable to male military personnel, is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nIt stated: \u201c In the case of Women Empowerment and Legal aid v. Attorney-General of the Federation (2015), the High Court held inter alia; \u201cin the instant case, the discrimination is not as to the fact that women were not recruited into the police force, but that they were recruited and subjected to some restrictions and disabilities as regulation 124 is the requirement that a woman police officer cannot marry, until a written application is made to the Commission of Police, and the Commissioner not only approves request to marry but must approve the choice of the man to be married. This with all respect is bizarre.\n\n\u201cAny Law or Regulation that makes or attempts to make the Commissioner for Police a plenary Guardian or a Guardian Angel to make or approve suitors for female police officers is not only unlawful, but it is also repulsive to the right of the woman police officer as a human being to make her own self-choice of suitors without the intervention of the state machineries.\n\n\u201cThe most fundamental issue is if this is the policy laid down for the police, does it apply to the menfolk. It is not. So, it is only issued to women police officers because of their gender as women and it is very much unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNigerians divided\n\nMeanwhile, the development stimulated controversies across the country as some Nigerians argued that the army had violated the fundamental human rights of the female soldier while others blamed Sofiyat for not respecting the uniform she was wearing.\n\nBumiBalogun said, \u201cI think the lady (soldier) has the right to accept the proposal but shouldn\u2019t be in public with an Army uniform or not outside with a camera. The Army is an organszation with unique rules and regulations with culture. I think that\u2019s gross misconduct in the military.\u201d\n\nAlso, Cecelia Phillip said, \u201cI think that is out of order, it tells a lot that while on duty she was having an affair with a Corp member. And in reality that behaviour does not reflect a positive attitude toward the military rules of engagement. She needs to face discipline in accordance with the army rules.\n\n\u201cI think why she was detained was because of the manner at which she displayed her happiness. Military personnel are not allowed to demonstrate excessive joy or happiness in a dictatorship government like that in Asia and Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ishaku Dantani said, \u201cSeriously, she is above 18 and has the right to accept or reject love proposals, either public or private. The only thing that I can fault is using an army uniform but detaining her is the height of it. We need to wake up from the oppressive mentality in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, Monday Ejale said, \u201cThe army is a discipline setting. She has a right to accept even a toddler for marriage, but hey, not with army uniform and in public? No. That is gross indiscipline.\u201d",

          "text": "The Super Eagles of Nigeria face Sudan in their second Group D match at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Saturday, eyeing a berth at the knockout stage of the biennial soccer competition.\n\nNigeria, three-time AFCON winners, had gotten off to a good start in the tournament following a 1-0 victory over record-holders Egypt in their first tie a few days back.\n\nThree points against the Falcons of Jediane at the Estadio Roumde Adjia, Garoua, will see the 2013 champions book a spot in the round of 16.\n\nNigeria\u2019s preparation for the competition had been marred with tussles over the release of players.\n\nWhile Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, was left out based on health grounds; Watford did not release in-form forward, Emmanuel Dennis, a development that raised concerns among fans.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Egypt, Sudan, And Guinea-Bissau] How Tough Is Nigeria\u2019s AFCON Group?\n\nAside from player availability, the sacking of long-time coach, Gernot Rohr, less than two months before the tournament also cast doubt on Nigeria\u2019s participation. In his stead, former international, Austin Eguaveon, was named to handle the side.\n\nBut in their first game on Tuesday, the Eagles deservedly defeated the record-winners 1-0 after a dominated display.\n\nNigeria Key Men And Team News\n\nEguaveon\u2019s side have an abundance of attacking options to do the damage against Sudan. Iheanacho is expected to continue his goalscoring form in Saturday\u2019s game while winger, Simon Moses, who was a thorn to the Egyptian defence in the first match, has his work cut out for the day.\n\nMidfielder Joe Aribo \u2013 the provider of the assist for the goal against Egypt \u2013 will carry much of the team\u2019s creative weight while Leicester City\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi shields the defence.\n\nAhmed Musa, the team\u2019s captain, who missed the first game, could have a chance of adding to his international cap.\n\n\u2018Completely Focussed\u2019\n\nBut there might not be a change of guard to the lineup that featured against Egypt. Defender Kenneth Omeruo is also expected to be fit for the match after he was stretchered off the pitch on Tuesday.\n\nIn a pre-match briefing, Eguaveon said the Super Eagles will not be carried away with the win against Egypt.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the players and their ability to give their best on the pitch. I am focused on winning against Sudan at the moment,\u201d the 1994 AFCON winner said. \u201cI am not thinking about anything else or how we will start our third match. We are completely focused on our match against Sudan. Beating Egypt was not easy, and we are looking forward to continuing our victories and qualifying for the next round.\u201d\n\nSudan\n\nThe Super Eagles opponents are only returning to the continental fiesta since 2012 and will want to make a statement in a group containing some of Africa\u2019s soccer heavyweights.\n\nThey hosted the maiden edition of the competition in 1957 and won the AFCON in 1970 also on home soil.\n\nBut a lull saw them miss the competition for 32 years, only to qualify in 2008 as Ghana hosted the continent.\n\nIn 2012, the Sudanese reached the quarter-finals of the biennial fiesta, one of their best outings in recent years.\n\nEn route to Cameroon, they earned 12 points from Group C, beating South Africa to finish second. They also scored nine goals in the qualification series.\n\nBut just weeks before the tournament, Hubert Velud was dismissed following the country\u2019s poor outing at the 2021 Arab Cup. They lost all group games, conceded 10 goals but scored none.\n\nThe development, however, is not deterring new coach, Burhan Tia, who insists his young side should not be underrated.\n\n\u201cOur team is young, and we are building for the future. The spirit, ambition, and motivation will be our strong weapons in the tournament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing impossible in football. The group might be strong, but with good preparations and concentration we will be able to make it to the knockout stage.\u201d\n\nHis team seem to be repaying his confidence in them as they battled hard to draw Guinea-Bissau in their first game. While Nigeria is a tougher opponent, the Falcons are hoping to give Nigeria a run for their money on Saturday.\n\nSudan Key Men And Team News\n\nThe Sudanese side will be missing the services Mohamed Abdelrahman who netted a third of their goals during the qualifiers.\n\nRamadan Agab, and Nasr Eldin El Shigail are the other men the Falcons of Jediane will rely on to cause a major upset against Nigeria. Sudan are ranked 33rd in Africa and 125 in the world.\n\nOpportunity For Youngstars\n\nTia will be banking on goalkeeper Ali Abu Ashren to continue his fine form when the match kicks off at the Roumde Adjia, Garoua. His sterling showing in the first fixture helped the Falcons earn a point against Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAlthough Coach Tia admitted that Sudan will miss Rahman, the team, he noted, can spring a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe play with a great team with high-level stars, but we will play with a balance between defense and attack,\u201d the coach told CAF ahead of the game.\n\n\u201cThe absence of Mohamed Abdel Rahman is impressive, but we have a number of young players waiting for an opportunity to appear.\u201d\n\nNigeria vs Sudan Head-To Head\n\nNigeria and Sudan have met 14 times at the international level out of which the Super Eagles won eight. Two of the games were draws while the North Africans have won twice.\n\nNigeria Vs Sudan Match Time\n\nThe game between Nigeria and Sudan at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) will start at 5:00 pm (WAT).",

          "title": "Supreme Court Halts Covid Vaccine Mandate for US Businesses",
          "text": "The US Supreme Court has stopped a major push by the Biden administration to boost the nation\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination rate, a requirement that employees at large businesses get a vaccine or test regularly and wear a mask on the job.\n\nAt the same time, the court is allowing the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most health care workers in the U.S. The court\u2019s orders Thursday came during a spike in coronavirus cases caused by the omicron variant.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s vaccine-or-test rule on U.S. businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected and OSHA had estimated that the rule would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over six months.\n\n\u201cOSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID\u201319 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here,\u201d the conservatives wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nIn dissent, the court\u2019s three liberals argued that it was the court that was overreaching by substituting its judgment for that of health experts. \u201cActing outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the Government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,\u201d Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he was \u201cdisappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law.\u201d\n\nBiden called on businesses to institute their own vaccination requirements, noting that a third of Fortune 100 companies already have done so.\n\nWhen crafting the OSHA rule, White House officials always anticipated legal challenges \u2014 and privately some harbored doubts that it could withstand them. The administration nonetheless still views the rule as a success at already driving millions of people to get vaccinated and encouraging private businesses to implement their own requirements that are unaffected by the legal challenge.\n\nThe OSHA regulation had initially been blocked by a federal appeals court in New Orleans, then allowed to take effect by a federal appellate panel in Cincinnati.\n\nBoth rules had been challenged by Republican-led states. In addition, business groups attacked the OSHA emergency regulation as too expensive and likely to cause workers to leave their jobs at a time when finding new employees already is difficult.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, called the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201ca significant victory for employers.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine mandate that the court will allow to be enforced nationwide scraped by on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the liberals to form a majority. The mandate covers virtually all health care workers in the country, applying to providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding. It affects 10.4 million workers at 76,000 health care facilities as well as home health care providers. The rule has medical and religious exemptions.\n\nBiden said that decision by the court \u201cwill save lives.\u201d\n\nIn an unsigned opinion, the court wrote: \u201cThe challenges posed by a global pandemic do not allow a federal agency to exercise power that Congress has not conferred upon it. At the same time, such unprecedented circumstances provide no grounds for limiting the exercise of authorities the agency has long been recognized to have.\u201d It said the \u201clatter principle governs\u201d in the healthcare arena.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in dissent that the case was about whether the administration has the authority \u201cto force healthcare workers, by coercing their employers, to undergo a medical procedure they do not want and cannot undo.\u201d He said the administration hadn\u2019t shown convincingly that Congress gave it that authority.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett signed onto Thomas\u2019 opinion. Alito wrote a separate dissent that the other three conservatives also joined.\n\nDecisions by federal appeals courts in New Orleans and St. Louis had blocked the mandate in about half the states. The administration already was taking steps to enforce it elsewhere.\n\nMore than 208 million Americans, 62.7% of the population, are fully vaccinated, and more than a third of those have received booster shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All nine justices have gotten booster shots.\n\nThe courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and reporters are asked for negative test results before being allowed inside the courtroom for arguments, though vaccinations are not required.\n\nThe justices heard arguments on the challenges last week. Their questions then hinted at the split verdict that they issued Thursday.\n\nA separate vaccine mandate for federal contractors, on hold after lower courts blocked it, has not been considered by the Supreme Court.",

People could socialise outdoors in groups of up to six people or two households.\n\nOther restrictions at the time included pubs and restaurants only being allowed to serve customers outside.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Slack \u201cgave a farewell speech to thank each team for the work they had done to support him, both those who had to be in the office for work and on a screen for those working from home\u201d.\n\nBut asked about the other party and whether drinking and dancing had taken place, she said No 10 had \u201cnothing further to add\u201d.\n\nMs Rayner said: \u201cThe Queen sat alone in mourning like so many did at the time with personal trauma and sacrifice to keep to the rules in the national interest.\n\n\u201cI have no words for the culture and behaviours at No 10 and the buck stops with the PM.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, also reiterated calls for the prime minister to resign over the growing list of parties, tweeting: \u201cThe Queen sitting alone, mourning the loss of her husband, was the defining image of lockdown.\n\n\u201cNot because she is the Queen, but because she was just another person, mourning alone like too many others.\n\n\u201cWhilst she mourned, No 10 partied.\u201d\n\nThis latest report adds to the growing list of alleged parties said to have taken place in Downing Street and other government departments during the pandemic.\n\nBut Mr Johnson has faced particular criticism after it emerged he had attended one on 20 May 2020 during the first lockdown.\n\nThe prime minister apologised on Wednesday in the House of Commons, saying he had joined staff for 25 minutes to thank them for their hard work. But he said he had \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the fifth Conservative MP to publicly say they had submitted a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson.\n\nHe told BBC Newsnight he had submitted the letter with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d, believing there was no sign the revelations about parties in Downing Street during lockdown would end soon.\n\nMr Bridgen, who backed Mr Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership contest, said this was \u201cpreventing the government from functioning as normal and that\u2019s an untenable position\u201d.\n\nA minimum of 54 Conservative MPs must send letters to the 1922 committee of backbench MPs in order to trigger a leadership challenge.\n\nChris Philp, minister for technology and the digital economy, said it was right to wait for the findings of Ms Gray\u2019s investigation.\n\nHe told Newsnight: \u201cI think the public deserve to have a proper investigation with the full facts.\u201d",
