          "text": "By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nABUJA\u2013The Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, on Thursday, described as unfortunate, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision not to assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nNBA, which is the umbrella body of legal practitioners in the country, said it was not convinced that the President demonstrated good faith in the exercise of his veto powers.\n\nREAD ALSO:Yuletide: Police caution against night journeys in Anambra\n\nThe association, in a statement that was signed by its National President, Mr. Olumide Apata, said it could not find any justification for President Buhari to have waited until the final moment before communicating his refusal to assent to the Bill.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association has received the unfortunate, but unsurprising, news of the decision of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR to decline assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the following reasons, we join other civil society groups and well-meaning Nigerians in expressing our discontent with the manner of the exercise of the President\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cThe NBA acknowledges that in withholding assent to the Bill, the President merely exercised a prerogative constitutionally available to him within the broader context of the rule of law, which the NBA stands for.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we are not convinced that, in the circumstance, the President demonstrated good faith in the exercise of his veto powers. Two interrelated factors account for our stand.\n\n\u201cFirstly, considering the significance of the Bill, one would have expected the Executive Arm of Government to be more directly involved in the legislative process while the Bill passed through the various legislative stages at both houses of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe decision to sit back and watch the National Assembly pass the Bill with the supposedly unworkable direct primaries provision did not do justice to the President\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we cannot find any justification for the President to have waited until the final moment before communicating his refusal to assent to the Bill.\n\n\u201cWe note that the Constitution donates a 30-day period to the President within which to assent or withhold assent to a bill.\n\n\u201cHowever, the fact that time is of the essence should have dictated that the President treat the Bill with a reasonable measure of urgency especially in the case where the President ultimately withheld his assent.\n\n\u201cWaiting until after expiration of the 30 days, and even taking advantage of an additional day under the Interpretation Act while the entire nation, waited with bated breath, only to communicate a veto, is not consistent with the conduct of a partner in the quest for the needed reform of the country\u2019s electoral process, which should ordinarily be a cardinal point of the President\u2019s agenda, and more fittingly, legacy.\n\n\u201cFurther, in view of His Excellency\u2019s personal experiences with the inadequacies of our electoral process, and having repeatedly pledged to strengthen the electoral process, not just in Nigeria, but also across the West African sub-region, the NBA expected more from the President.\n\n\u201cWe fail to see how the above actions contribute to strengthening the electoral process.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstance, the credibility of the 9th National Assembly is on the line, and the ball is now firmly in their proverbial court to rise to the occasion, and either take the historic decision to override the President\u2019s veto or immediately take the necessary legislative steps to effect any necessary changes and return the Bill to the President for reconsideration.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the National Assembly risks lending credence to the rumours in some corners that the provisions relating to direct primaries were inserted into the Bill to provide a leeway for the eventual rejection of the Bill.\n\n\u201cWith less than 14 months before the next general elections, the NBA calls on the National Assembly to act right and timeously before it is too late\u201d, the statement read.",

J. Aneke of the Federal High Court, Lagos.\n\n\u201d She has also been remanded in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service while the matter is adjourned to 17th January 2022 for commencement of trial,\u201dthe statement read.\n\nThe statement said the Director-General of NAPTIP, Dr Fatima Waziri-Azi disclosed this at a Virtual meeting, tagged:\u201dThe Conversation with NAPTIP\u201d,with stakeholders and partners of the agency to mark her first 100 days as Director-General of NAPTIP.\n\nShe stated that the prosecution is being supported by the British and Spanish authorities through the Mutual Legal Assistance between Nigeria and the other two countries.\n\n\u2018\u2019 This is the first time NAPTIP would be prosecuting a case where evidence from another country transmitted to Nigeria through Mutual Legal Assistance, is used to arrest the target and case filed in court\u2019\u2019, she added.\n\n\u201cThis case is coming just as the agency has also commenced the prosecution of an official of a Law Enforcement Agency involved in the trafficking of young persons to other countries,\u201dthe statement noted.\n\nAccording to the Director-General, the ongoing prosecutions are in line with the Agency\u2019s renewed strategy for enhanced prosecution of high\u2013profile traffickers and cases of violence against persons in Nigeria.\n\nCounting some of her modest milestones since she assumed office, she said \u201cSince September, the Agency has received two hundred and twenty-four (224) cases, investigated thirty-nine (39), and one hundred and eighty-nine (189) suspects have been detained and interrogated.\n\n\u201cTwo hundred and ninety-eight (298) victims have been rescued in partnership with other sister agencies, International Organizations, and NGOs.\n\nA total number of 19 repatriations have been successful with the invaluable support of IOM, following intelligence reports received and we have about 15 joint intelligence operations currently ongoing. NAPTIP has secured six (6) convictions (Kano, Sokoto, Benin). Bringing the total number of convictions to 490\u2019\u2019.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201d On assumption of office, I was crystal clear and deliberate about what I needed to do and where I want NAPTIP to be as an anti-human trafficking law enforcement Agency. And my approach is based on 4 strategic priorities (Enhanced conviction rate of High Profile Traffickers; evidence based and sustainable return and reintegration programs for victims of TIP & SOM; scaled age-appropriate awareness creation on the ills of TIP, especially at the sub-national level, in urban poor communities and rural areas and amongst the youths; and enhanced visibility of the work of the agency, its partners and reporting channels .\n\n\u201cThese 4 strategic priorities plug into the 5-point overarching strategies of the Agency, which is Prosecution, Protection, Prevention, partnership and policy.\n\n\u201cWith the support of IOM, FIIAPP, Italian embassy, UNODC and other partners, we have successfully completed several capacity building for NAPTIP prosecutors, intelligence officers and investigators\u201d.\n\nShe however, pointed out that the only panacea to an effective fight against human trafficking across the globe is a sufficient response from stakeholders without borders, enough political will as well as unconditional collaboration and cooperation among State and Non- State Actors.",

I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy, and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country,\u201d he said, \u201cand we thank God for giving us so many resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nOn security in the North West, he said it was sad that the people who lived together, sharing the same culture and outlook for a long time would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nThe President said the military will come down hard on the North West to stabilise the situation, having procured more hardware.\n\n\u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state-of-the-art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high-quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North East but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services,\u201d the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended Prof. Babagana Zulum, Governor of Borno, for the work he had done in two years, noting that he was in the state earlier in June to commission developmental projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Zulum appreciated the President for honoring the state, adding that Alhaji Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c he said.\n\nGovernor Zulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Alhaji Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nIn his remarks, Alhaji Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\n\u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places,\u201d he said.\n\nVice Chancellor of the University, Prof Aliyu Shugaba, thanked President Buhari for honoring the invitation anf Alhaji Indimi for the contribution.",

          "text": "Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi\n\n\u2026Visits Mota-Engil rail site, Portugal\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nMinister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Thursday, met with the financing advisory for the construction of Kano-Maradi rail line, seeking a speed-up of the process to ensure construction begins in the next few weeks.\n\nAt a mmeeting held at the Nigerian Embassy, Berlin with representatives of KfW-IPEX bank of Germany who are serving as an advisory in partnership with African Finance Corporation for the Kano-Maradi rail project, Amaechi said Export Credit Agencies are free to come to Nigeria and become part of the process on ground to ensure that everything follows their recommenced practices and avert hiccups in the course of the project.\n\nREAD ALSO:Electoral bill: Save Nigeria from Buhari now, PDP Reps\u2019 caucus cries out\n\nFollowing their concerns on resettlement of villages that may be impacted by the construction, Amaechi assured that Nigeria has laws in place for that and that the Ministry of Transportation ensured that the right of way was distant from the villages except in Kano where it is difficult to totally avoid the town.\n\n\u201cFor us in the Ministry of Transportation, in choosing the right of way, we avoided communities. If we don\u2019t do that, we will clear the entire Kano. Like in Lagos, we avoided communities and used the old line, because if we had to choose a different route, we would pay billions. In fact, to even work from the old line, we paid 7 billion naira in compensations, not because the people had the right to the land, but because after 12 years and nothing is done, it becomes their land and you just can\u2019t chase them out.\n\n\u201cWe still paid compensation, because the rail line was moribund. To eject them, we still had to treat them as though they were the original owners of the land. We didn\u2019t wait for Europe. That\u2019s our law.\n\n\u201cIn Kano-Maradi, we also took into consideration the people, we choose the right of way distant from the communities, which makes it even more expensive because the government will have to do access roads from the rail line into the communities. We did that because of environmental issues, but the Europeans want us to assume that there are people living along the route. There are none, apart from Kano.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the first step by giving notice, we have assessed the land. What we have not done is payment, because the payment is tied to the contract. On our part, we are ready. What I want to know is the next step to paying compensation, to know that the project is going on and that we can create employment,\u201d he said.\n\nManaging Director/Global Head, Aviation Mobility and Transport, KfW-IPEX Bank, Dr. Carsten Wiebers expressed belief that the Nigerian government will be able to manage the risk with payback of the loan. He advised that the process of putting in place the consulting firms for the project should be sped-up to facilitate financing, while documentation of the process should be properly done.\n\n\u201cGiven the fast timeline of 15months, I would recommend speeding up the process of putting in place the consulting companies and other terms of references are met to facilitate the financing. Of course, the first level of requirement is your national regulation and law. You take care of that.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is create a bridge between your interests and the demands of the Export Credit Agencies, to guarantee we get an affordable loan for you. There has to be evidence of the working group in the areas where the rail would be (actual site) all the way to Kano to convince the decision-makers of the ECAs.\n\n\u201cPersonally I\u2019m comfortable with your timeline. You dictate the speed of the construction with Mota-Engil. There needs to be an international representative on the site to avoid hiccups with the ECAs. The problem I think is documentation and communication. The process needs to be properly documented and certified,\u201d Wiebers said, in a statement signed by Eric Ojiekwe, Director of Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Transportation.\n\nDirector, Mobility and Transport, KfW-IPEX Bank, Sylvia Sedlacek, assured that a consortium of consultants is already working on the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, ESIA, and would come up with the report soon, while a working group has been formed and is in talks with the Nigerian Ministries of Environment, Transportation and Housing on the Environment and social study of the are.\n\nOn his part, Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar explained that the Ministry of Environment in Nigeria started as the Environmental protection agency which also came about through conventions and a series of stakeholders meetings, locally and internationally. So they are naturally inclined to abide by the regulations.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi with a team from the Ministry and officials of the Nigerian Embassy in Portugal toured a major rail project site by Mota-Engil to ascertain their capacity to construct the Kano-Maradi rail within the stated timeframe of 15 months.",

If he makes transfers, EFCC will still trace it. He should only withdraw and then deposit into another account,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Yusuf declared Malami was in charge of the anti-graft body, and had ordered the unfreezing of \u201cbig accounts\u201d.\n\n\u201cMalami now controls the EFCC. The commission is in his hands. Once Malami speaks, the account will be unfrozen. They are unfreezing suspects\u2019 accounts, including the big cases,\u201d he revealed.\n\nIn a release Thursday night, EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren, announced the start of investigation of the tape.\n\nHe stated that the commission will activate its internal mechanism to deal with the issues arising therefrom.\n\nThe spokesman said the EFCC does not condone acts of corruption and abuse of privilege for financial gratification by personnel.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, snippets of the audio recording clearly showed an abysmally compromised \u201cofficer\u201d dropping names to ingratiate his benefactor, a relative of a crime suspect.\n\n\u201cBy the alleged action, the said officer is no more than a corrupt fifth columnist with scant regard for the values of the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe action is contemptuous of the established Standard Operating Procedure of the EFCC. Such professional indiscretion has no place in the new EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe Commission encourages citizens who encounter any such unprofessional conduct by personnel of the EFCC to report to the Commission in support of our quest to build a better Agency.\n\n\u201cReporting such conducts has been made easy by the Eagle Eye App, a financial crimes reporting application which was launched earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWe encourage members of the public to download the App from the Apple and Google Play Store and put it to use\u201d, the statement added.",

Abubakar Aliyu.\n\nThe approval was given at the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nAliyu told State House reporters that the action was in response to the demand for increased electricity supply across the nation.\n\nThe minister said the major problem Nigeria faces in the Electricity Supply Industry is the ability to evacuate sufficient electricity and distribute them.\n\n\u201cWe have a very weak transmission grid and distribution segment of the value chain. We may not be having much problem with generation\u201d, he explained.\n\n\u201cUnless we\u2019re able to strengthen the electricity grid, expand, and be able to evacuate, what the grid can take to consumers will cause a lot of problems.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing through various interventions is repair the grid by constructing new transmission lines and bring in new equipments to replace old ones at substations.\n\n\u201cThen, we will release more capacity to the distribution and leading to the customers. The operational capacity is hovering around 5,000 megawatts and the transmission and distribution.\n\n\u201cThese projects brought to council today and got approvals are all geared towards strengthening the willing capacity of the transmission and towards distribution.\n\n\u201cThe distribution segment of the NESI (Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry) is been privatized, but we cannot fold our arms and allow them to continue not to do much to evacuate what the transmission can bring.\n\n\u201cWe need to put more investment into the transmission so that we can improve the willing capacity of the TCN to be able to take up enough electricity from the generation.\u201d\n\nIn the breakdown, approval was given for the construction of a 2X60MVA 132/33 KVA substation at Ikare-Akoko and 2\u00d7132 KV Lines Bay Extension at Oke-Agbe, Ondo State at the cost of $9,9928,912 and N2,037,076,700.\n\nThere will be supply of 65 Hilux vehicle and 20 SUVs nationwide at the cost of N2,741,787,500.

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nEminent Nigerians, senior citizens, leaders of geopolitical zones and ethnic nationalities, including former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III; Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi and Alhaji Murtala Aliyu, secretary general, Arewa, have identified key areas of the country\u2019s national life that must be urgently addressed to douse the socio-political and economic challenges as well as the separatist and self-determination agitations in the country.\n\nTheir observations are contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued after an open dialogue meeting held physically in Abuja and virtually across the world on December 13. The meeting convened by Vision Africa (VA) and the Global Peace Foundation (GPF), a safe, non-judgemental and non-hypocritical platform aimed to bridge the gap across ideological, political, ethnic, religious and cultural divides, was a strategy to understand the conflict dynamics in Nigeria and chart a path to peace and integral security in the country.\n\nIt also seeks to usher in an increased understanding of the root of conflict and violence affecting Nigeria, increase positive relationship between the Nigerian government and various agitating groups across the country and focus on the importance of universal principles and shared values as the glue for social cohesion and sustainable peace.\n\nThe meeting listed the 1999 Constitution, which was described as \u2018Oligo-military in nature\u2019 and not representing the collective interest of Nigerians; social injustice and a failed economy, which has led to high prevalence of insecurity and neglect of oil exploration communities and minorities, as some of the key issues that deepen the threat to the nation\u2019s security and unity.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution does not embody the principles of justice, fairness and equality on which every democracy is founded. Thus, it does not fully protect the rights and interests of Nigeria\u2019s diverse constituencies. We call on the government to begin a process of constitution review, amend and rework the constitution, drawing on our previous constitutions, amongst other things, to synchronise/harmonise the laudable principles they embody.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure, not one-off solutions, but lasting change. Government at all levels must revisit and show sincere effort at understanding the core issues of dissidence and self-determination in Nigeria rather than incarceration, bullets and counter-attacks as government\u2019s response to agitations and unrest. The dialogue revealed that even in our divergence, there exists an area of convergence. We, therefore, commit to keeping the conversation room open for further dialogue so as to address and resolve the common challenge that is deepening this divide.\u201d\n\nThe meeting, a sequel to an earlier \u2018Inclusive Security Dialogue Retreat\u2019 held at the Airlie Conference Centre in Warrenton, Washington DC, USA, in October 2021, noted that national development cannot be achieved without focus on youths and the education sector, and an intentional inter-generational collaboration between the elite and the youths.\n\nIt charged religious and traditional rulers to put an end to all manner of incitement, misrepresentation and distortions of neighbours but rather to explore the country\u2019s diversity to discover what is best for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNational development without a focus on youths and the education sector, and an intentional inter-generational collaboration between the elite and the youths may not augur well for our security. Neither will the organised movement of street children and the disabled from one part of the country to another.\n\n\u201cWe postpone dooms day if it is ignored. National reconciliation conference that allows the principles of fairness, equity and justice; with an immediate consideration of legitimate agitations, and a collective effort to de-escalate the conflict and violence across the nation can no longer be ignored. The 1999 Constitution is Oligo-military in nature and does not represent our collective interests; it needs to be re-negotiated by national ethics.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cA constitutional review process, enabling peace and social cohesion is necessary. Government shall therefore provide an environment where a new Constitution from the representatives of the people by the people and for the people would emerge.\u201d\n\nThe meeting called for cessation of incitement, misrepresentation and distortion of the image and all other incidents that tend to pit various nationalities and creed against one another. It said Nigeria must explore its diverse religion and traditions to discover what is best for the people.\n\nIt added: \u201cGovernment must act sincerely as an unbiased arbiter to address insecurity headlong as the high prevalence of violent crisis, kidnapping, and fatal attacks in Nigeria are driven largely by social injustice and a failed economy.\n\n\u201cThe Church, the Mosque, and traditional worshippers must, as a matter of morality, step up to the responsibility of contributing to the collective re-engineering and moral rearmament urgently needed to salvage our nation, in fulfilling their roles as religious leaders and pulpit managers.\u201d\n\nThe communique also admonished: \u201cThe simple objective is to honestly and transparently come to the dialogue table or \u2018conversation room\u2019 irrespective of our political leanings or ideologies \u2013 focusing first, on our common humanity. The purpose of the retreat was to bring stakeholders together to address critical issues and seek lasting solutions to the grave challenges facing Nigeria, beginning from an affirmation of transcendent truths that define our common humanity.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria, and indeed Nigerians, face an existential challenge, we circulated invitations to an intentional pool of key influencers, political leaders, regional leaders and leaders of separatist/agitating/self-determination groups; and high-level religious and civil society leaders, to address the conditions that foster unrest and radicalism globally \u2013 poverty, unemployment, social dislocation, cultural polarization, and a large demographic of disaffected and alienated Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cHigh prevalence of insecurity in Nigeria is driven largely by social Injustice and a failed economy; hence fuelling continued agitation by the country\u2019s young alienated generation. Hunger and starvation in the land will get worse as continued violence and insecurity makes our farms unsafe for families whose basic sustenance is dependent on their yields from the farms. Neglect of oil exploration communities and minorities will only deepen the threat to our security and unity. Underdevelopment and isolation cannot remain the strategy else they will be uncomfortable to remain with the concept of Nigeria. The role of religious leaders and pulpit managers (traditional, Christian, Islam) in our moral rearmament and collective re-engineering is urgently needed to salvage our nation.\u201d\n\nThose physically present at the meeting include former president, Obasanjo, the Sultan of Sokoto, Rev. Pam Yakubu, executive secretary, Christian Pilgrims Commission; Sheikh Gumi, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, Alhaji Murtala Aliyu, Amb. Ahmed, director, Northern Elders Forum, Amb.

          "title": "Buhari Regime Drags Nigeria Into Controversial Deal With Turkey In Exchange For Military Support",
          "text": "Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari has entered into a controversial deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to keep some Turkey-linked companies in Nigeria under surveillance.\n\nThis, according to a report by AfricaReport, is to gain the support of the Turkish government in terms of infrastructure and military assistance, particularly with the rate of insecurity in the country.\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria and Turkey were embroiled in a diplomatic row.\n\nThe Turkish President, who had just survived a coup and assassination attempt at the time, was on a mission to expose and arrest all those behind the attack that claimed 300 lives.\n\nHe claimed the coup plotters were linked to the Gulen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish businessman and influential cleric who is in exile in the United States.\n\nGulen, a former ally of Erdogan, repeatedly denied the allegations as he also claimed that he didn\u2019t know 99% of the members of his influential movement which boasts of three to six million members worldwide.\n\nErdogan made attempts to extradite Gulen from the US but failed and started reaching out to several African leaders with a view to shutting all businesses linked to the Gulen movement in their countries.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Hakan Cakil, called on Nigeria to close 17 Turkish schools in the country with ties to the Gulen movement.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the Nigerian government to close down the schools\u2026 I have requested officially, both orally and in writing, the closure of these schools.\n\n\u201cAlso, I have sent a letter to Mr Geoffrey Onyeama (foreign minister) and Mr Abba Kyari (chief of staff to the president) about this subject and requested their support for the closure of the schools,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from schools, several institutions affected included hospitals and other establishments.\n\nHowever, considering that Nigeria was facing one of its worst economic downturns ever at the time, the government was reluctant to honour such a request.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said the request would not be considered until the Turkish government provided satisfactory evidence.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unfavourable response further infuriated the Turkish government as several Nigerian students attending Turkish schools abroad were arrested while others were deported for reasons never stated.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s adviser on Diaspora Affairs at the time, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, confirmed to local media that \u201cthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the permanent secretary summoned the Turkish Ambassador immediately the information was received.\n\n\u201cWhile both countries are working at resolving the issue through every possible diplomatic channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made it clear that such acts against Nigerians will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nConsequently, businesses that were linked to Gulen in Nigeria began removing Turkey from their business names and rebranded completely although they maintained their Turkish orientation.\n\nSome of these companies include the Nigerian Turkish International College (NTIC) with branches in Kaduna, Abuja, Kano, Yobe, Ogun and Lagos. The school changed its name to Nigerian Tulip International School.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Turkish Nile University changed its name to Nile University. The Nigeria Turkish Nizamiye Hospital which was patronised by Nigeria\u2019s elite was simply changed to Nizamiye Hospital.\n\nDespite these moves, however, Turkey remained adamant.\n\nIn 2019, the new Turkey Ambassador to Nigeria, Melih Ulueren, said at an event in commemoration of the third year anniversary of the coup that the Turkish Maarif Foundation had been set up to take over all business interests linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nWith Turkey unable to take over the business interests of the Gulen movement in Nigeria, Erdogan decided to take a new approach and give Nigeria an offer that would be difficult to refuse.\n\nWith the surge in insecurity in recent times and its many facets including banditry, terrorism, kidnapping among others, the Nigerian government is in desperate need for weapons and intelligence, also, considering the impending arms embargo by the United States Congress due to human rights concerns, Nigeria needed to explore other options and unlike the US, Turkey would be willing to partner with Nigeria without such stringent human rights conditions.\n\nMaking a direct reference to Nigeria\u2019s security quagmire, Erdogan during his visit to Nigeria in October 2021 told President Buhari that his administration would continuously share intelligence with Nigerian authorities.\n\nHe was quick to add that those behind the attempted coup in Turkey were still very active in Nigeria and there needed to be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe sensitivity we show in fighting terrorism, I hope will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. The perpetrators of the heinous failed coup of July the 15 FETO are still very active in Nigeria. And we are continually sharing our intelligence with Nigerian interlocutors and authorities,\u201d Erdogan was quoted as saying.\n\nAs a show of good faith, Buhari immediately announced the removal of Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 red list. The Nigerian President revealed that he signed eight major agreements with Turkey on several key sectors including energy, defence industry, mining and hydrocarbons among others. Buhari also praised Erdogan for opening his country\u2019s borders to accommodate millions of refugees in dire need of humanitarian support.\n\nBuhari also recently visited Istanbul for the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit. During the visit which Presidency officials described as \u2018epic\u2019, several agreements were reached.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said in a Facebook post that Turkish technology in Nigeria will surely quicken the process and efforts to \u201crid Nigeria of pockets of terrorists and the menace of kidnappers and bandits. From their wide experience and advances in technology in fighting terrorism and banditry, they have a lot to give and they have assured us that they will give that support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Nigeria will not allow any part of our territory to be used to undermine a friendly state such as Turkey. Under our strict Central Bank and Financial Intelligence Unit\u2019s governance structure and management, money from the investments in issue cannot be moved anywhere to finance subversive activities,\u201d said Shehu.\n\nApart from Turkey\u2019s military assistance, Buhari also hopes to ensure that Erdogan would assist Nigeria to build infrastructure which has been the exclusive preserve of China.\n\nThe Marif Foundation funded by the Turkish government is also expected to build a five-star hotel and conference centre, schools and a world-class hospital in Abuja.",

          "text": "Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari has entered into a controversial deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to keep some Turkey-linked companies in Nigeria under surveillance.\n\nThis, according to a report by AfricaReport, is to gain the support of the Turkish government in terms of infrastructure and military assistance, particularly with the rate of insecurity in the country.\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria and Turkey were embroiled in a diplomatic row.\n\nThe Turkish President, who had just survived a coup and assassination attempt at the time, was on a mission to expose and arrest all those behind the attack that claimed 300 lives.\n\nHe claimed the coup plotters were linked to the Gulen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish businessman and influential cleric who is in exile in the United States.\n\nGulen, a former ally of Erdogan, repeatedly denied the allegations as he also claimed that he didn\u2019t know 99% of the members of his influential movement which boasts of three to six million members worldwide.\n\nErdogan made attempts to extradite Gulen from the US but failed and started reaching out to several African leaders with a view to shutting all businesses linked to the Gulen movement in their countries.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Hakan Cakil, called on Nigeria to close 17 Turkish schools in the country with ties to the Gulen movement.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the Nigerian government to close down the schools\u2026 I have requested officially, both orally and in writing, the closure of these schools.\n\n\u201cAlso, I have sent a letter to Mr Geoffrey Onyeama (foreign minister) and Mr Abba Kyari (chief of staff to the president) about this subject and requested their support for the closure of the schools,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from schools, several institutions affected included hospitals and other establishments.\n\nHowever, considering that Nigeria was facing one of its worst economic downturns ever at the time, the government was reluctant to honour such a request.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said the request would not be considered until the Turkish government provided satisfactory evidence.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unfavourable response further infuriated the Turkish government as several Nigerian students attending Turkish schools abroad were arrested while others were deported for reasons never stated.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s adviser on Diaspora Affairs at the time, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, confirmed to local media that \u201cthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the permanent secretary summoned the Turkish Ambassador immediately the information was received.\n\n\u201cWhile both countries are working at resolving the issue through every possible diplomatic channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made it clear that such acts against Nigerians will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nConsequently, businesses that were linked to Gulen in Nigeria began removing Turkey from their business names and rebranded completely although they maintained their Turkish orientation.\n\nSome of these companies include the Nigerian Turkish International College (NTIC) with branches in Kaduna, Abuja, Kano, Yobe, Ogun and Lagos. The school changed its name to Nigerian Tulip International School.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Turkish Nile University changed its name to Nile University. The Nigeria Turkish Nizamiye Hospital which was patronised by Nigeria\u2019s elite was simply changed to Nizamiye Hospital.\n\nDespite these moves, however, Turkey remained adamant.\n\nIn 2019, the new Turkey Ambassador to Nigeria, Melih Ulueren, said at an event in commemoration of the third year anniversary of the coup that the Turkish Maarif Foundation had been set up to take over all business interests linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nWith Turkey unable to take over the business interests of the Gulen movement in Nigeria, Erdogan decided to take a new approach and give Nigeria an offer that would be difficult to refuse.\n\nWith the surge in insecurity in recent times and its many facets including banditry, terrorism, kidnapping among others, the Nigerian government is in desperate need for weapons and intelligence, also, considering the impending arms embargo by the United States Congress due to human rights concerns, Nigeria needed to explore other options and unlike the US, Turkey would be willing to partner with Nigeria without such stringent human rights conditions.\n\nMaking a direct reference to Nigeria\u2019s security quagmire, Erdogan during his visit to Nigeria in October 2021 told President Buhari that his administration would continuously share intelligence with Nigerian authorities.\n\nHe was quick to add that those behind the attempted coup in Turkey were still very active in Nigeria and there needed to be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe sensitivity we show in fighting terrorism, I hope will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. The perpetrators of the heinous failed coup of July the 15 FETO are still very active in Nigeria. And we are continually sharing our intelligence with Nigerian interlocutors and authorities,\u201d Erdogan was quoted as saying.\n\nAs a show of good faith, Buhari immediately announced the removal of Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 red list. The Nigerian President revealed that he signed eight major agreements with Turkey on several key sectors including energy, defence industry, mining and hydrocarbons among others. Buhari also praised Erdogan for opening his country\u2019s borders to accommodate millions of refugees in dire need of humanitarian support.\n\nBuhari also recently visited Istanbul for the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit. During the visit which Presidency officials described as \u2018epic\u2019, several agreements were reached.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said in a Facebook post that Turkish technology in Nigeria will surely quicken the process and efforts to \u201crid Nigeria of pockets of terrorists and the menace of kidnappers and bandits. From their wide experience and advances in technology in fighting terrorism and banditry, they have a lot to give and they have assured us that they will give that support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Nigeria will not allow any part of our territory to be used to undermine a friendly state such as Turkey. Under our strict Central Bank and Financial Intelligence Unit\u2019s governance structure and management, money from the investments in issue cannot be moved anywhere to finance subversive activities,\u201d said Shehu.\n\nApart from Turkey\u2019s military assistance, Buhari also hopes to ensure that Erdogan would assist Nigeria to build infrastructure which has been the exclusive preserve of China.\n\nThe Marif Foundation funded by the Turkish government is also expected to build a five-star hotel and conference centre, schools and a world-class hospital in Abuja.",

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

I will also be interested in hosting the 2022 annual conference so as to afford investors the opportunity to see the abundant opportunities in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cAs a government, we are trying to create an enabling environment by making sure that we are putting the right infrastructure in place as well as a supportive legal environment.\n\n\u201cWe are also cleaning up our educational system to produce people who are ready for work. We don\u2019t have a choice but to produce what we consume; production will not only be taking place in Lagos but in other states of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why I am going to focus on a lot of investment opportunities here next year because there are major opportunities outside Lagos. The amount of investment opportunities that we see coming into Edo in terms of agriculture, film, tech, services, and entertainment, among others, is quite impressive,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nEarlier, Amolegbe lauded the governor\u2019s developmental strides across all sectors of the state, adding that the institute is proud of Governor Obaseki.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Federal Government on Wednesday destroyed over 1m doses of Astrazeneca vaccines donated to combat COVID-19.\n\nThe Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, led the destruction at Gosa Dumpsite, about 2km from the Idu Railway Station, Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe withdrew about 1,066,214, doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines from across the country,\u201d he said\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria(NAN), reports that Nigeria joined other African countries, like Malawi, South Sudan, Liberia, Mauritania, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Comoros, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in destroying the expired COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cAs you can see these vaccines have now been deposited by the Abuja Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cWe have come through in our promise to all Nigerians to be transparent in our delivery of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines did not expire before we took the decision to withdraw them. Today is an opportunity for Nigerians to have further faith in our vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cWe worked with our sister agency, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who took that decision to destroy these vaccines at the point that they got expired.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is the work that requires trust. It is a sacred trust that has been bestowed on us by the generalizing generality of Nigerians and hold that trust to be true,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the heroes of today\u2019s activity were actually the frontline health workers.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, when these vaccines were offered to us, we knew that they had a short shelf life. But we were living in an environment where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines were very scarce.\n\n\u201cThey were not available due to vaccine nationalism. Some developed countries that procured these vaccines, hoarded them in their stores,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended members of staff of the NPHCDA who worked Saturdays or Sundays on very extreme situations to make sure that Nigerians have access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe were able to vaccinate over 10 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo my heart and my pride goes out to those frontline health workers that continue to work around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe still have short shelf life vaccines in the country. They are still potent.\n\n\u201cThey have not reached the end of use dates and the health workers are still going around every communities and settlement to ensure Nigerians are vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThis decision has saved Nigeria over 40 million dollars,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr. Mojisola Adeyeye, noted that Nigeria was the only country with a unique immunization programme.\n\n\u201cNigeria has one of the best vaccination immunization program in the world. UNICEF mentioned this last year. But we started this journey months before the vaccines came.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we are witnessing today. It is a continuous unfolding of the fact that the best is for all Nigerians, because Nigerians deserve the best in terms of quality of medicines, vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeyeye added that this was the basis of the endless meetings between NPHCDA and NAFDAC. Noting that when NAFDAC approved a vaccine it means that what the agency had seen on paper was the package of the history of the vaccine development.\n\n\u201cWe have been working night and day together. And what he said about the vaccines coming with short expiration dates pose a challenge to us as a country.\n\n\u201cBut because of the love of the country we decided to walk with that tight timespan or challenge,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted that NAFDAC was the only regulatory agency in Africa that tests the subjects the vaccines test.\n\nNAN reports that Malawi was the first country to publicly destroy vaccine doses in May.\n\nThe African Union\u2019s African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team shipped over 900,000 doses AstraZeneca vaccine to 13 African nations through donations.\n\nBut, the Serum institute of India, which manufactured these doses, extended the shelf-life to July 13, there was confusion in the expiration dates.\n\nThis Countries have also faced challenges planning and funding for in-country rollouts, as well as vaccine hesitancy, which has made it difficult for countries to quickly administer the jabs into the arms of citizens.\n\n...",

However, the Police failed in all totality to find and/or establish any offences(s)against him as alleged by his faceless and busy body persons who have later identified chiefs of Ooni of Ife.\n\n\u201cThat their allegations bother on the fact our client lacks the power to confer Chieftaincy title within his domain to celebrate his 50 years which is purely civil matter. Our client thereafter applied for a certified true copy of said petition written against him vide a letter dated 18/10/2021 and the same was received by the Commissioner of Police on the 18th of October, 2021.\n\n\u201cOur client thereafter met and complained to the Commissioner of Police on the 25th of October, 2021 that he was yet to be given the certified true copy who requested for the case file but was told that the case file was missing.\n\n\u201cThat our client was advised by the Commissioner of Police to be patient.\n\n\u201cBut despite all efforts of our client to obtain the certified true copy of the petition from Sp Afolayan Sunday as requested proved abortive which became apparent that SP Afolayan Sunday the officer in charge of SIB, Osun State command does not want to release the said Petition on the instructions of the Commission of police on reasons best known to them.\n\n\u201cThat on the 16th of November,2021 I wrote a letter to the Inspector General of Police and the Police Service Commission while I also instructed my counsel to also write to Inspector General of Police and the Police Service Commission against the Commissioner of Police, Mr Wale Olokode for his refusal to release the certified true copy of the said petition on request.\n\n\u201cThat while our client was still awaiting your response on the above letter received another letter of invitation directing him to attend another scheduled interview sessions on Thursday 9th December 2021 which did not disclose any alleged offences the reason why he should attend said orchestrated interview session or disclosed the identities of the so-called petitioners with the Deputy Commissioner of Police, General Investigation Section, Force Criminal Investigation Department Annex, Alagbon Close, Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\n\u201cThat the persistent persecutions and the incessant invitation letters our client is not unconnected with the several Chieftaincy and Land cases he instituted against the Ooni of Ife.\n\n\u201cThat they decided to use the instrumentality of the Police which became a willing tool in order to stop the birthday celebration and restrain him from conferring Chieftaincy title on a worthy son of Ido-Ife land by concocting the spurious and baseless allegation in order for the Police to restrain the movement of our client and stop the programme\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, spokesperson to Ooni of Ife, Comrade Moses Olafare discarded the claims against the palace saying the Olojudo was dethroned by late Ooni Olubuse Sijuade for various offences.\n\n\u201cOoni Adeyeye, had about six years ago, had attempted to magnanimously reverse the dethronement when some palace chiefs came up with more outrageous offence against him, thereby stalling the process and that was the last time we heard anything about him.

          "text": "In a bid to significantly increase power supply, the federal government has approved all 16 memos on power projects presented by Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu.\n\nThe minister disclosed this to State House correspondents after the extraordinary Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting which was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja on Thursday.\n\nSome of the project costs are in different local and foreign currencies. They are $65,606,420, \u20ac15,152,651 and N31,360,272,397.\n\nSpeaking on the memo he presented, Aliyu stated: \u201cToday, I presented to council 16 memos, which I seek for council\u2019s approval and the council graciously approved all of them. At this point, let me say what these approvals will do to the nation\u2019s electricity supply.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re all aware, the major problem we\u2019re having in the Electricity Supply Industry is to be able to evacuate sufficient electricity and distribute them.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, we have a very weak transmission grid and distribution segment of the value chain.\n\n\u201cWe may not be having much problem with generation. So, unless we\u2019re able to strengthen the electricity grid, which is nationwide, and to expand, and to be able to evacuate, what the grid can take to consumers, we will have a lot of problems ahead of us.\n\n\u201cSo, what we\u2019re doing currently through various and several interventions is to be able to repair the grid by constructing new transmission lines, bringing in new equipments to replace the old ones at our substations. So, that will release more capacity to the distribution and leading to the customers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, the operational capacity, as you all know now is hovering around 5,000 megawatts and the transmission and distribution.\n\n\u201cSo, these projects that we brought to council today and got approvals are all geared towards strengthening the willing capacity of the transmission and towards distribution, even though as you all know, the distribution segment of the NESI (Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry) is been privatized, but we cannot fold our arms and allow them to continue not to do much in order to evacuate what the transmission can bring.\n\n\u201cBut as as it is now, even the transmission is not that strong. So, we need to put more investment into the transmission so that we can improve the willing capacity of the TCN to be able to take up enough electricity from the generation.\n\n\u201cSo, these memos, although 16 of them but they\u2019re all geared towards achieving what I\u2019ve just explained. So I\u2019m going to read them out for you for purpose of records and information.\n\n\u201cThe approval was given for award of contract for the construction of a 2X60MVA 132/33 KVA substation at Ikare-Akoko and 2\u00d7132 KV Lines Bay Extension at Oke-Agbe, Ondo State at the cost of $9,9928,912.80 and N2,037,076,700.00.\n\n\u201cSupply of 65 Hilux vehicle and 20 SUVs nationwide at the cost of N2,741,787,500.00.

          "text": "No fewer than five persons, among them a 17 year-old girl, died on Thursday, while 12 others sustained various degrees of injuries when suspected Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists fired mortar bombs on Gomari Ayafe and Ajilari Cross communities of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital just some minutes to the arrival of President Muhammadu Buhari to the State.\n\nAt least five mortar bombs were reportedly fired by the terrorists which landed and exploded on six separate houses thus resulting in the deaths and attendant destructions in the areas affected.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity to our correspondent, a resident of Gomari Ayafe, one of the areas of the explosion, where four deaths were recorded, which is about 300 meters away from the Nigerian Air Force Base and Staff Quarters in Maiduguri, said the latest attack was the second in two weeks that the terrorists would carry out in the area.\n\nHe decried the insecure nature of the capital city and wondered how the insurgents are operating from no distant location and yet remain unchecked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHusseni Garba, a motor mechanic at Baga road area of Maiduguri and the father of the 17 year-old Fati Garba, who was mutilated by the explosion at Ajilari Cross, said he left his daughter at home for work, but few meters away from his house he heard an explosion and by the time he returned back to his house , he saw the body of his daughter dismembered by the explosion and his house destroyed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am a mechanic at Baga road. What has happened is the will of God. I left my house and few hours after that, I heard an explosion and on returning back I met the shattered body of my daughter.\n\n\u201cShe is 17 year-old student in Senior Secondary School at Liberty Standard School at Gomari Ayafe. My daughter\u2019s ambition while she was alive was to be a Nurse. Now that God has taken her, I am appealing to government to assist me in rehabilitating my destroyed house.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Garba, 40 year-old brother of the deceased\u2019s mother, Shettima Hassan, said they heard a noise like an aircraft that had landed at their home not knowing that it was a mortar bomb, adding that by the time they entered the house, they discovered the shattered body of the deceased.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAlthough, nothing can replace human life, we plead to the government to assist us in rebuilding the destroyed house,\u201d Hassan reiterated.\n\nThe injured victims were taken to Umara Shehu Ultramodern Hospital while the rest of the victims who died await burial according to Islamic injunction.\n\nWhen our correspondent visited the scene, mourners, majority women were seen in sober mood awaiting the funeral prayer for the deceased to led by an Imam.\n\nIt could be recalled that the last mortar bomb that was fired by the terrorists in the same area over two weeks ago resulted in the death of a teenager.\n\nThe terrorists who had been making fruitless efforts to invade Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno State due to the vigilant and gallantry efforts of the Nigerian military, the Civilian Joint Taskforce (CJTF) and other security agencies, have resorted to firing of mortar bombs and rocket launchers from distant locations with the aim of registering their presence.\n\nHowever, the latest attack coincided with the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari who was in Maiduguri for the commissioning of Borno\u2019s first flyover, other projects and a centre for distance learning built by a business mogul, Dr. Mohammed Indimi, at the University of Maiduguri.",

          "text": "No fewer than five persons, among them a 17 year-old girl, died on Thursday, while 12 others sustained various degrees of injuries when suspected Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists fired mortar bombs on Gomari Ayafe and Ajilari Cross communities of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital just some minutes to the arrival of President Muhammadu Buhari to the State.\n\nAt least five mortar bombs were reportedly fired by the terrorists which landed and exploded on six separate houses thus resulting in the deaths and attendant destructions in the areas affected.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity to our correspondent, a resident of Gomari Ayafe, one of the areas of the explosion, where four deaths were recorded, which is about 300 meters away from the Nigerian Air Force Base and Staff Quarters in Maiduguri, said the latest attack was the second in two weeks that the terrorists would carry out in the area.\n\nHe decried the insecure nature of the capital city and wondered how the insurgents are operating from no distant location and yet remain unchecked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHusseni Garba, a motor mechanic at Baga road area of Maiduguri and the father of the 17 year-old Fati Garba, who was mutilated by the explosion at Ajilari Cross, said he left his daughter at home for work, but few meters away from his house he heard an explosion and by the time he returned back to his house , he saw the body of his daughter dismembered by the explosion and his house destroyed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am a mechanic at Baga road. What has happened is the will of God. I left my house and few hours after that, I heard an explosion and on returning back I met the shattered body of my daughter.\n\n\u201cShe is 17 year-old student in Senior Secondary School at Liberty Standard School at Gomari Ayafe. My daughter\u2019s ambition while she was alive was to be a Nurse. Now that God has taken her, I am appealing to government to assist me in rehabilitating my destroyed house.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Garba, 40 year-old brother of the deceased\u2019s mother, Shettima Hassan, said they heard a noise like an aircraft that had landed at their home not knowing that it was a mortar bomb, adding that by the time they entered the house, they discovered the shattered body of the deceased.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAlthough, nothing can replace human life, we plead to the government to assist us in rebuilding the destroyed house,\u201d Hassan reiterated.\n\nThe injured victims were taken to Umara Shehu Ultramodern Hospital while the rest of the victims who died await burial according to Islamic injunction.\n\nWhen our correspondent visited the scene, mourners, majority women were seen in sober mood awaiting the funeral prayer for the deceased to led by an Imam.\n\nIt could be recalled that the last mortar bomb that was fired by the terrorists in the same area over two weeks ago resulted in the death of a teenager.\n\nThe terrorists who had been making fruitless efforts to invade Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno State due to the vigilant and gallantry efforts of the Nigerian military, the Civilian Joint Taskforce (CJTF) and other security agencies, have resorted to firing of mortar bombs and rocket launchers from distant locations with the aim of registering their presence.\n\nHowever, the latest attack coincided with the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari who was in Maiduguri for the commissioning of Borno\u2019s first flyover, other projects and a centre for distance learning built by a business mogul, Dr. Mohammed Indimi, at the University of Maiduguri.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Maiduguri, Borno State, urged troops of Operation Hadin Kai to remain steadfast as they go into the final phase of the campaign against insurgency and other forms of criminalities.\n\nThe President, who addressed the troops at the Airforce Base in Maiduguri, Borno State capital, said the entire nation remains grateful for the gallantry displayed in ensuring gradual return of peace to the North-East, while condoling with families that have lost loved ones, and the wounded.\n\n\u201cI urge you also to stay focused to achieve our strategic end-state which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North East Geo-political Zone and other parts of the Country where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari assured families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the nation and the injured that the Federal Government will cater for their needs, recognising their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country.\n\n\u201cYour career is like no other because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others.\n\n\u201cI am therefore here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and indeed the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the Government would continue to ensure that the widows and children of fallen heroes were well catered for, to help them fully realise their potentials.\n\nThe President noted that the response exhibited across the theatre had shown extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces is known for. Well done.\n\n\u201cOur country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterized by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes.\n\n\u201cFurther to the reorganizations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead,\u201d the President added.\n\nWhile noting threats posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), he said substantial resources have also been directed at procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, similar attention is being given to Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the Theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the troops that at the onset of the administration he emphasized the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force, which was in realization of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimize the mutual gains for our respective national security.\n\n\u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North East Region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region.\n\n\u201cI am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy,\u201d he added.\n\nHe assured that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders including friendly nations, civil society organizations as well as other credible non-governmental organizations to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed deep appreciation to the Government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the Federal Government in multiple spheres.\n\nAdding, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the State.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the Federal Government and states.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Service Chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation which continues to enhance operations.\n\n\u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the Research and Development Exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s Annual Conference and the launch of locally constructed Seaward Defence Ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander in Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur Government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible,\u201d the President assured.\n\nThe President stated that the manpower challenges which have limited the rotation of some units from the Theatre would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is already counting the remaining months to his exit as Nigeria\u2019s leader as he told an audience in Maiduguri that he has 17 months more to spend at the helm.\n\nHe said his administration will keep giving its best for the development of the country until May, 2023, reiterating that he will handover as stipulated by the Constitution.\n\nThe President spoke after the commissioning of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nIndimi is co-father in law with Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari also commissioned the Tijjani Bolori Memorial Secondary School and the first fly-over in Borno State, Custom Roundabout (3.5km) with a stretch of 10 km Gamboru Ngala Road constructed by the state government.\n\nBuhari said: \u201c I know I swore by the Constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country,\u201d he said, \u201cand we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nOn security in the North West, he said it was sad that the people who lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nThe President said the military will come down hard on the North West to stabilise the situation, having procured more hardwares.\n\n\u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri.\n\n\u201cI am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North East but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services,\u201d the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended Prof. Babagana Zulum, Governor of Borno, for the work he had done in two years, noting that he was in the state earlier in June to commission developmental projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Zulum appreciated the President for honoring the state, adding that Alhaji Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c he said.\n\nGovernor Zulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Alhaji Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him.\n\nIt will now be known as Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nIn his remarks, Alhaji Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\n\u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places,\u201d he said.\n\nVice Chancellor of the University, Prof Aliyu Shugaba, thanked President Buhari for honoring the invitation and Alhaji Indimi for the contribution.",

I am therefore here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021.\n\n\u201cI do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno state and indeed the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nHe said government would continue to ensure that the widows and children of fallen heroes were well catered for to help them fully realise their potentials.\n\nThe president said the response exhibited across the theatre had shown extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces is known for. Well done.\n\n\u201cOur country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterized by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes.\n\n\u201cFurther to the reorganizations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting the threats posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the President said substantial resources have also been directed at procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal.\n\nHe said a similar attention is being given to Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the Theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also told the troops that at the onset of the administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force, which was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimize the mutual gains for our respective national security.\n\n\u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North East Region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region.\n\n\u201cI am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno state, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari assured that the present administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders including friendly nations, civil society organizations as well as other credible non-governmental organizations to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nExpressing appreciation to Borno state government, the president said: \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state. I particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno.\n\n\u201cYours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the Federal Government and states.\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence, the Chief of Defence Staff, Service Chiefs and the heads of other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation which continues to enhance operations.\n\n\u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the Research and Development Exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s Annual Conference and the launch of locally constructed Seaward Defence Ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander in Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "World\u2019s second-biggest miner Rio Tinto Group has agreed to buy a lithium mine in Argentina for $825 million as the company accelerates its push into battery materials.\n\nThe top mining firms are increasingly looking to expand into so-called future facing commodities, such as lithium, copper and even fertilizers, as investors and governments increase pressure on more polluting materials that have long been the most profitable.\n\nRio stated that it will buy the Rincon asset in Argentina from private equity buyers. The lithium brine project is in the so-called lithium triangle in South America, home to many of the best lithium deposits. Major automakers from Tesla Inc. to Volkswagen AG need an ever-growing supply of battery materials to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles.\n\nThe deal, along with the recent acquisitions of Millennial Lithium Corp. and Neo Lithium Corp., helps cement Argentina\u2019s position as a long-term destination for lithium development, said Chris Berry, president of industry consultancy House Mountain Partners.\n\nAccording to the Rio Chief Executive Officer, Jakob Stausholm, \u201cThis acquisition is strongly aligned with our strategy to prioritize growth capital in commodities that support decarbonisation and to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe company said the undeveloped project has the potential to produce battery grade lithium carbonate.\n\nRio is already looking to develop a $2.4 billion lithium mine in Serbia as it moves to diversify its business away from iron ore. Yet, the company\u2019s plans there have come under pressure from local activists who have filled streets in protest against the project.\n\nThose hurdles make the deal in Argentina \u201cespecially important,\u201d House Mountain\u2019s Berry said. \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes I see mining companies make is that they don\u2019t have a plan B. Clearly, Rio has thought their lithium strategy through.\u201d\n\nRio\u2019s push into lithium comes as prices surge. The global transition toward electrified transport has fired up consumption and lithium prices have more than tripled this year to a record. Miners are scurrying to expand capacity, but they can\u2019t keep up with demand and market tightness is likely to persist in the near term.\n\nRio\u2019s peers, which have so far shunned lithium, are also looking to diversify. Larger miner BHP Group is trying to buy a Canadian nickel project \u2014 another vital component in the types of batteries that power electric cars or back up renewable energy. It\u2019s also looking to build a giant fertilizer mine, as is Anglo American Plc.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

          "title": "Electoral Act Amendment: Nigeria Senate Cowers, Suspends Move to Override Buhari\u2019s Veto",
          "text": "Despite the resolve and threat by many senators on Tuesday to overrule President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the senate Wednesday, backed down from its resolve. In place of the move, which had seen the collection of signatures for the proposition, the upper chamber resolved to liaise with the House of Representatives on how best to handle the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral reform bill.\n\nThe senate also agreed to involve their constituents in the consultation process during the Christmas break before taking a final decision by January.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, citing issues with direct primaries provisions in the bill.\n\nBut members of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives said the reasons given by the president for not assenting to the bill were a mere decoy to stop the electronic transmission of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), using direct primaries as a peg.\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, went ahead to identify two plausible options currently before the National Assembly. Saraki said the legislature should either veto Buhari\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nSome senators had at the end of Tuesday\u2019s plenary expressed anger over the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral bill, saying they have secured over 75 signatures ahead of a plan to veto the president at Wednesday\u2019s plenary. But the threat was eventually not carried out, as President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, while summarising the outcome of their closed-door session, said the senate would now consult with the House of Representatives on how to respond to Buhari\u2019s letter on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill.\n\nAccording to Lawan, the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) do not permit the upper chamber to exclusively take action on such matters in the absence of the House of Representatives, which had already embarked on vacation. He assured Nigerians that a joint position would be reached with the House after due consultation with the people to determine the appropriate line of action, when both chambers reconvene from the Christmas break in January.\n\nSpeaking on what transpired at the executive session, the senate president said, \u201cThe senate in a closed session deliberated on matters relevant to the workings of the senate, in particular, and, the National Assembly, in general.\n\n\u201cThe senate, also, in the closed session, discussed how to respond to the letter from Mr. President on the electoral bill amendment. The senate consequently resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January, when both the senate and House will be in session.\n\n\u201cPresently, the House of Reps has gone on recess and, like we all know, the constitutional provision is for the senate and House of Representatives to jointly take the appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe senate also resolved to consult with our constituents during our recess in January. The senate believes that our constituents have a role to play as the major stakeholders in the laws that we make in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHowever, the leader of the PDP caucus in the House, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said the president was actually trying hard to avoid the electronic transmission of results and had used direct primaries as a decoy.\n\nThe caucus assured Nigerians that it would ensure that its members exercised their constitutional power to veto the president whenever the matter was tabled for discussion\n\nChinda said, \u201cThe untold reason of declining is to avoid the electronic transmission of results, which will improve the credibility of the electoral system. This refusal, though contemplated, has left Nigerians confounded by a president, who continues to show utter disdain for the constitution and the reform of the institutions of state.\n\n\u201cUnder him, our institutions of state have regressed, to the point that the gains of previous institutional reforms embarked on by Our Great Party while in power, have been either lost to his inaction or to his deliberate ploy to leave our country worse than he met it. On this point alone, we are not convinced that he is interested in the reform of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAs an opposition caucus, we will ensure that our members exercise their power under Section 58(5) of the constitution to veto the president whenever the National Assembly deems it fit to table the issue for discussion.\u201d\n\nSaraki Identifies Options Before Legislature\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, opposed Buhari\u2019s decision to throw out the entire amendments to the electoral bill, saying there are two options before the federal lawmakers.\n\nIn a statement, Saraki said the lawmakers could override the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nThe former senate president stated, \u201cNow that Mr. President has conveyed his decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act [amendment] Bill, I am sure that I speak on behalf of millions of Nigerians in urging the National Assembly to act fast. This is because we cannot sit back and allow one contentious clause to throw away all the positives in the proposed Electoral Act (amendment) Bill.\n\n\u201cAt this point, two options are open to the National Assembly. They either veto the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provision on direct primaries and send it back to the president for his assent. Whichever option our legislators choose, can be accomplished in the shortest possible time. We could have a new electoral law in January 2022.\n\n\u201cAnyone that has been following the mood of the nation knows that Nigerians desire to have a new electoral law that will lead to having a credible, free, fair, and peaceful process of electing our leaders. They want a system that will ensure that their votes truly count in the election of those who govern them.\n\n\u201cThis proposed electoral law is expected to reassure the youths, many of whom steer clear of the political process, because they have no confidence in the system. They believe the system is usually rigged and compromised. One way to bring this active demography into the political system is to enact a new law that will give them hope in our nation. This Electoral Act [Amendment] Bill serves that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as the representatives of the Nigerian people, the National Assembly must take a decision in the interest of our nation and its long-term democracy. The option of not doing anything after the refusal of the assent by the president is not an option. Our legislators in both chambers of the National Assembly and Mr. President must ensure that it becomes a law without delay.\u201d\n\nPDP: APC Scuttling Electoral Reform for Fear of 2023\n\nThe leadership of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of ruining the Electoral Act Amendment Bill because some key provisions of the bill would not allow them to rig the 2023 general election. PDP said its investigations revealed that the undercurrent was fear of failure at the 2023 general election and the positive implications that the electoral bill would have by guaranteeing electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe opposition party recalled that APC had been in trepidation of the amendment to the Electoral Act due mainly to the provision of electronic transmission of election results, which would completely eliminate manipulations and alteration of results at elections.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said it was apparent that APC and the Buhari presidency were never committed to the amendment of the Electoral Act to ensure credible elections. PDP accused APC of triggering a controversy over the mode of primaries by political parties as a camouflage to scuttle the entire amendment, including provisions for electronic transmission of results.\n\nPDP said, \u201cIt is imperative to remind Nigerians of how the APC, in collusion with their leaders in the National Assembly, fought hard to stop the electronic transmission of results provision in the bill, but were resisted by Nigerians supported by the courageous action of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, which staged a walkout only for the APC to orchestrate controversies and set the stage for the withholding of assent by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThe main reason for this manipulation of the legislative process by the APC is to prevent the electronic transmission of results so that it can continue in its culture of rigging and electoral impunities, including alteration of results at collation, ballot box snatching, destruction of data, among others, just to cling to power against the will of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSuch is consistent with the APC\u2019s well-known machination against every genuine effort to instil credible, transparent, free and fair elections in Nigeria in the last six years. The APC thrives in electoral scam, duplicity, underhand dealings, violence and political brigandage, all in their heinous script to put Nigerians under perpetual bondage.\u201d\n\nPDP alleged that APC, having been rejected for its failures and having also self-decimated its structures across the country, had completely lost the capacity and goodwill for electoral contest and as such sought every means to subvert any process that could guarantee credible elections in 2023.\n\nPDP said the subversion of the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by APC further validated the fact that APC was averse to the aspiration of Nigerians and did not believe in democratic principles of credible elections.\n\nMore Nigerians React\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians from all walks of life have continued to react to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the electoral bill.\n\nA member of the House of Representative, Henry Nwawuba, said he did not see any power tussle at play in the whole situation.\n\nNwawuba, who spoke Wednesday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Channel, said, \u201cIt is part of the process that as it goes through the rounds in the House, we expose the law to public dialogue, and then we send it off for access. The speaker has said when we come back in January, we are going to take another look at the electoral bill, as it is not over yet.\u201d\n\nOn the news that almost 80 senators had agreed to override the president, Nwawuba stressed that the bill was in the courts of the National Assembly, which would come together and take the best decision in the interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a critical piece of legislation that is contained in our legislative agenda and we are determined to see them through. We are going to deal with the Electoral Act, by the grace of God, when we come back in January.\u201d\n\nA lawyer, Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, who also spoke Wednesday on the Morning Show, clarified the issue of indirect primaries, saying each party has the right to choose direct or indirect primaries.\n\nAccording to Osaze-Uzzi, direct primaries support every member of the political party to vote and choose the candidate for a particular election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere are many good sides of the bill and we must not lose sight of those aspects. There are also some aspects the president did not touch, which some find worrisome. The timelines have been extended for the conduct of primaries for all sorts of steps to be taken as expected by the law.\u201d\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Kunle Adegoke, said on the ARISE Morning Show that political parties were free to determine their internal affairs. Adegoke explained that the recent intervention by the legislature to regulate the affairs of political parties actually stemmed from the fact that the power given to the political parties to regulate their internal affairs had been substantially abused and this has led to a lot of agitation.\n\nAdegoke said, \u201cThe National Assembly knows the constitution that we run in Nigeria recognises only the legislature to take a final decision in this regard. We can as well pass the act all over again and the president will have no choice. We can\u2019t just say we have the power and we are free to exercise it, we must look at all factors that fit the process we are trying to take on.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",

          "text": "Twenty four hours after the House of Representatives okayed the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the Senate also followed suit as it passed an aggregate expenditure of N17.126 trillion as budget for next fiscal year.\n\nThe Red Chamber also approved the N276.8 billion request of President Muhammadu Buhari for funding of expenditure in the 2021 budget before adjourning plenary to January 18, 2022.\n\nThis is just as President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan also disclosed that the National Assembly would on Thursday transmit the 2022 budget passed by both chambers to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nLawan also canvassed for the Senate to stabilise the nation\u2019s polity ahead of the 2023 general elections as the Red Chamber prepares to consider the report of the committee on the review of the 1999 constitution upon resumption of plenary in January, 2022.\n\nThe passage of the budget during plenary was sequel to the consideration of a report by the Appropriations Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill.\n\nPresenting the report, Chairman of the Committee, Senator Barau Jibrin, said the revenue projection for the 2022 budget was predicated on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework/Fiscal Strategy Paper approved by the National Assembly.\n\nBarau recalled that the National Assembly had approved 1.88mbpd daily oil production and $62 as against the $57 proposed by the executive arm of government.\n\nHe explained that the increase in oil price benchmark was done to reflect the current market value in the international market.\n\nThe ranking Senator added that the exchange rate was pegged at N410.15/$1, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projection at 4.2 per cent and inflation rate estimated at 13 percent.\n\nAccording to him, out of the N17,126,873,917,692 approved, N869,667,187,542 is for statutory transfer;

For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan further stated that the Red Chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonise with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence,\u201d the Senate President said.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilise the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilising the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilising institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLawan underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja",

This is why they decided to make a public show of the destruction of the expired jabs,\u201d he said.\n\nFaisal Shuaib, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency executive director told reporters that a shortage of vaccine supplies on the continent had forced Nigeria to take the doses, knowing full well they had a short shelf life.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully withdrawn 1,066,214 doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines. We have kept our promise to be transparent to Nigerians. The destruction today is an opportunity for Nigerians to have faith in our vaccination programme,\u201d Shuaib said.\n\nGovernments on the continent of more than one billion people have been pushing for more vaccine deliveries as inoculation rates lag richer regions.\n\nThe lower vaccination levels raise the risk of higher infection and death rates from COVID-19, especially as new, fast-spreading variants emerge such as Omicron.\n\nHealth Minister Osagie Ehanire has said Nigeria will no longer accept vaccines with a short shelf life, citing a presidential committee decision.\n\nThe World Health Organisation said 12,971,729 vaccine doses have been administered in Nigeria as of December 19.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous country, with a population exceeding 200 million, has recorded 227,378 COVID-19 cases and 2,989 deaths since the pandemic started.\n\nHealth experts have said Nigeria needs to triple its vaccination drive from about 100,000 doses a day to meet its target to inoculate more than half its population by the end of next year.\n\nRecently, like many other African countries, Nigeria has seen a surge in vaccine supply, which has highlighted other issues relating to distribution and hesitation by citizens to get inoculated.",
