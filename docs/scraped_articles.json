          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it is introducing two new science subjects for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.\n\nThe Registrar of JAMB, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, stated this on Saturday in Abuja.\n\nThe subjects are Physical Health Education and Computer Science.\n\n\u201cWe are asking and sensitising the public, particularly the students, who are to take the exam, that these are two science subjects that will be added to their choice to widen opportunities for candidates to be able to access tertiary education,\u201d Oloyede stated.\n\nThe registrar also noted that the board would soon clear the backlog of illegal admissions conducted by tertiary institutions in the country.\n\nHe said the move was to ensure that students, who were improperly admitted, but had the minimum qualifications, were rescued.\n\nJAMB had recently uncovered 706,189 illegal admissions by universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and other related institutions.\n\n\u201cWe want to continue the campaign to discourage those who are committing such illegal action to stop doing so,\u201d Oloyede said.\n\nWhile noting that a cashless registration system was adopted for 2022 UTME, Oloyede said JAMB would also prohibit computer-based test centres from selling e-PINs to guard against extortion of candidates.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is known that many CBT centres, despite supervision, still manage to exploit candidates.\n\n\u201cWe want to put a stop to that; we have intensified monitoring, but part of what we are doing is to ensure that we protect the students against this extortion.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that anybody who wants to sell ePIN will not be a CBT centre operator. Once you are a CBT centre operator, you have lost the right to sell ePIN, so that we can hold the ePIN sellers responsible for what they do.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Rita Okoye\n\n\n\nFor over 20 years, Makari (which means \u2018beautiful\u2019 in Swahili) has catered to people of colour globally with innovative groundbreaking skincare products Made for Melanin.\n\nRecently, they had a \u2018LoveLife Campaign\u2019 which captures different demos of women and how they are pulling through with work, family and their respective lifestyles.\n\nAllure Vanguard captures four of these women who have successfully made beauty and skincare an everyday lifestyle.\n\nTania Omotayo, a 29 year old model, brand ambassador, entrepreneur, Bisola Omoregha, a versatile makeup artist, Mariam Bakre, a content creator and Diana Eneje, a fashion enthusiast, model, vlogger and social media influencer.\n\n1. Tania Omotayo\u2026 Fusing beauty into fashion\n\nTania Omotayo is a Fashion entrepreneur, Style Star and Content creator. She is founder of fashion brands, Ziva Lagos and Ziva kids. Recently, she was unveiled as the brand ambassador of Makari Suisse\u2019s 24 Karat Rose Gold Collection.\n\nOmotayo speaks on how she has successfully made fashion and beauty a huge part of her life and how the Makari brand made this fusion seamless in her everyday life.\n\nWhat inspired your kind of fashion and style?\n\nComfort is key for me. I\u2019m not really a fan of complicated and uncomfortable outfits unless, I, absolutely have to which is not very often thankfully.\n\nHow long does it take you to dress up for red carpet events and what are the steps you take?\n\nIt takes me about 2-3 hours. I usually get my hair done first then my make up. I, also, have to have a full jam up and Karaoke session to hype myself up and that usually takes another 20-30 minutes.\n\nCan you tell us more about Makari\u2019s 24 karat Gold range?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing! And I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m a Makari Babe. I\u2019m really obsessed with skin care and the 24k range really excited me. The 24k dry oil is my absolute favourite because there\u2019s nothing I love more than glowing! And it gives my skin just the right amount of glow for all occasions. Another absolute favourite of mine is the 24k hydrating mask, it\u2019s basically a facial on the go and the glow it leaves your skin with is surreal.\n\nFashion and beauty is a huge part of your life, how has Makari brand amplified that?\n\nIn my opinion, fashion and beauty go hand-in-hand. What\u2019s the point in dressing glamorous and your skin isn\u2019t matching? Taking care of my skin is key and Makari makes that so easy. With the Makati 24k range, I don\u2019t require a million products to get my desired glow.\n\nCan you share your top 5 skincare routine must haves?\n\nA great face wash, toner, moisturizer, sunscreen and night cream.\n\nWhat are the 3 beauty items you can\u2019t do without daily?\n\nMy Makari sunscreen, Lipgloss and Face masks.\n\nHow do you cope with life as a mum and entrepreneur?\n\nI don\u2019t cope (Laughs). Honestly, it\u2019s not easy and every day is so different. So, I just take each day as it comes. Also, prioritizing is very important so one does not suffer. It\u2019s important for me to be at work and it\u2019s also important for me to spend time with my daughter, and be available for drop off and pick up from school. I have learnt to manage my time, because that\u2019s the only way to balance it.\n\nWhat lessons has motherhood taught you?\n\nMotherhood has taught me patience. It has taught me to want to be the best version of myself. I wake up everyday and I choose to be a better person because I want my daughter to grow up, and have a mother she can be proud of. Most of all, it has taught me a love I have never experienced before. A love that only your own child can give you.\n\nBisola Omoregha\u2026Fuelling Her Passion For Make-up\n\nBisola Omoregha is a celebrity make up Artist and has built a successful career in beauty with intricate detail to skin work. She shares how Makari is a huge part of this journey and how it is essential for her craft.\n\nMake-up has become a huge part of life for almost everyone, how did the journey begin for you?\n\nIt started in my 4th year in the University of Lagos, UNILAG. I came across my first makeup YouTube video, and since then I\u2019ve been hooked.\n\nHow has Makari been a huge part of this journey and how it is essential for your crafts?\n\nI really like the range of products I\u2019ve tried from Makari. From the very pigmented eye-shadows to the top quality skincare line. Everything just works and performs beautifully when I use them.\n\nHow has the Makari brand influenced your everyday lifestyle?\n\nMy daily skincare routine feels special mostly because I\u2019m seeing results. I know I\u2019m not just applying products just to feel fancy, they work.\n\nWhat has been the major challenges as a celebrity Make-up artist?\n\nIt is customizing routines to suit their ever changing lifestyle and needs. I think it\u2019s also exciting.\n\nWhat determines the choice of products you use on your clients?\n\nTheir skin needs, their lifestyle and the brief.\n\nWhat are the top 5 makeup products you can\u2019t do without?\n\nMoisturizer, Lip gloss, foundation, concealer powder\n\nWhat are the first steps to take before applying makeup?\n\nCleanse, massage, moisturize, primer and then finally, set your intention.\n\nWhat does it take to start up make-up as a career?\n\nLots and lots of passion and patience.\n\nMariam Bakre\u2026Juggling Dual Roles\n\nMariam Bakre, popularly known as Mory Coco, is a comical content creator, a YouTube lifestyle vlogger, food blogger and an entrepreneur. As a new mum, she lets everyone in on how she juggles her dual roles and still shows how beauty is still represented in a world of seemingly impossible beauty standards.\n\nAs a new mum, what are the major challenges?\n\nHmmm, as clich\u00e9 as this may sound, I wouldn\u2019t say they are challenges. They are more like responsibilities. I\u2019ve had to be more responsible, and I\u2019ve had to double my hustle. I can\u2019t just leave the house and say, I\u2019m going out; I have to plan ahead. On some days, it takes its toll, but every day, I enjoy it.\n\nHow has it been joggling the role of a new mom and that of a content creator?\n\nI have all the help in the world! I don\u2019t think I can do it all on my own, not even if I tried. I have an amazing partner, the best grandmas, awesome domestic staff, all willing to help. All I have to do is ask. And sometimes, I don\u2019t even have to. They know. I\u2019m so blessed to have such amazing support system.\n\nWhat has motherhood changed about you?\n\nIt has made me so vulnerable, bold, and fearless, knowing that I have a little human looking up to me and a lot of the decisions I make would most likely affect her in one way or the other. I can\u2019t afford to be slack anymore. I love the feeling.\n\nSome new mums lose their beauty, proper skincare shortly after delivery, what can be done to be different?\n\nTo be honest, a healthy mum is a happy mum. If you don\u2019t take care of the beauty within, no matter how much you do on the outside, it won\u2019t reflect. No mum wants to loose her physical beauty; a lot of times, it comes from exhaustion. Stop trying to do everything on your own! Open your mouth, ask for help, no award for suffer head! A healthy mum is a beautiful mum which automatically means a happy baby. If you\u2019re well-rested, you would definitely have the zeal to do your facials, skin care routine and so on.\n\nWhat are those skincare routine that has become your everyday lifestyle?\n\nI have to use my toner, moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, sun screen and anti aging moisturizer\n\nWhat would you advice a new mom about skincare, beauty and lifestyle?\n\nDear moms, you\u2019re doing amazing! You\u2019re the best thing since sliced bread! You are strong, your are beautiful and you\u2019re perfect. You\u2019re not supposed to do this alone, it takes an entire community. All you have to do is ask and we\u2019ll be there. When you\u2019re well-rested, that is only when you\u2019ll have time for face routine.\n\nDiana Eneje..Young and getting it\n\nDiana Eneje is young, determined and getting it as an influencer and refuses to be placed in a box.

          "text": "The Zik\u2019s Flats, an estate of hostels at the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), until recently, has been part of the hostel facilities provided by the university for its students. DAMIAN DURUIHEOMA , who visited the estate recently, reports that the huge edifices have become dilapidated due to several years of abandonment; resulting in the unfit state of the buildings for human habitation.\n\nThe University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) has come a long way. It is the home of the great \u201cLions and Lionesses,\u201d a popular sobriquet for the institution\u2019s students and graduates.\n\nThe university was founded by Nigeria\u2019s first President, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe in 1955 and formally opened on October 7, 1960. The institution has three campuses located at Nsukka, Enugu and Ituku-Ozalla\u2013all in Enugu State.\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s verified Facebook handle, the UNN has about 40,000 students. The main campus of the university is located on 871 hectares (2,150 acres) of hilly savannah in the town of Nsukka, about 80 kilometres north of Enugu, with an additional 209 hectares of arable land available for experimental farming and 207 hectares for housing development for members of staff.\n\nLike every human creation susceptible to wear and tear, various edifices at the institution are currently in a decrepit state. However, the most debilitating is Zik\u2019s Flats.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe nature of Zik\u2019s Flats\n\nZik\u2019s Flats is an estate of 20 storey buildings and 12 bungalows used as hostels by the Nsukka Campus of the university for its students. The estate, The Nation learned, was owned by Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, who later, before his death, handed it over to the management of the country\u2019s premier university as part of his social welfare contributions to the institution. The asset was equally meant to help the university to reduce the effects of accommodation problems experienced by the university as a result of its growing population.\n\nWith well-built duplexes of two-storeys and bungalows with about 700 hostel-size rooms and over 3,000-bed spaces, expansive playgrounds, a line of dozens of stores, a car park and a cafeteria with many restaurants, Zik\u2019s Flats was definitely the most beautiful and exciting hostel to live in.\n\nThis is in addition to the feeling of sharing a perimeter fence, by students, with the Great Zik\u2019s Onuiyi Haven, where the family of the country\u2019s first President currently live in.\n\nThis, it was learnt, was the reason Zik\u2019s Flats became the residential hall reserved for first-year students, a kind of technique meant to introduce them to the school system and enable them to adapt to studying before being sent into the main campus.\n\nHow dilapidation crept in\n\nOver the years, however, the estate has been left abandoned and taken over by grasses, trees and dangerous reptiles, which have become constant threats to surrounding buildings, especially that of the family of the late Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nOur correspondent\u2019s recent visit to the Nsukka Campus of the university revealed the sorry state of the estate, which hitherto provided shelter for a teeming number of students, and housed dozens of business centres, as the buildings now stand desolate and abandoned.\n\nWith a 40, 000-student population and with an annual intake of about 10,000 students, investigation reveals that the existing 17 halls of residence in the Nsukka Campus of the university have a total bed space that is less than 8,000.\n\nPlausible reasons for abandonment\n\nThis perhaps, explains why private hostel businesses are thriving more in Nsukka Town with each room going for a minimum of N150, 000 as against N12, 000 paid for a bed space in the university by students.\n\nDespite this huge amount and coupled with the prevailing economic situation, it is said that some members of the university staff and top officials of the management present and past are alleged to be clandestinely building private hostels and consequently allowing the school hostels to deteriorate.\n\nThe Nation gathered that before he left office two years ago, the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Prof. Benjamin Chukwuma Ozumba, inaugurated the construction of a modern hostel complex on a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) Model. The hostel complex which promised to be a new model of hostel accommodation in the country was to replace the old dilapidated Ziks Flats. But, the investigation showed that the project never saw the light of the day.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 concerns\n\nExpectedly, some stakeholders are concerned that, at a time when many students are facing accommodation problems with its concomitant health consequences, the university only thought it wise to leave Zik\u2019s Flats to deteriorate and waste away.\n\nOne of the former students of the university, Dr Ben Ugwuh, who spoke with our correspondent, lamented that successive administrations in the university had allowed the estate to be in unimaginable ruins.\n\nUgwuh, who disclosed that he once lived in the hostel, said it was unbelievable that a university that was in a constant shortfall for students\u2019 accommodation would allow the place to remain desolate.\n\n\u201cIt beats my imagination why a university such as the great UNN should allow these structures to be in this current state with no student living there in the past seven years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated, however, that the only possible reason Zik\u2019s Flats and other hostels in the university were \u201cbeing allowed to rot away,\u201d was to allow private hostel owners, most of who are members of the university staff, to make heavy returns on their investments.\n\n\u201cApart from the rumours we have heard, I know that members of the university management and most members of staff of the university have numerous hostels within Nsukka Town. These hostels charge between N150, 000 and N250, 000 per annum for a room. Do a comparison with what each student pays for a bed space in school hostels.\n\n\u201cAnd to think that most of the Vice-Chancellors in recent times, including the current V-C, Prof. Igwe, were occupants of Zik\u2019s Flats makes the rumours strongly believable. So, I think it\u2019s a deliberate policy of making the private hostel owners have good returns on their investments that led to the abandonment of Zik\u2019s Flats and other hostels by successive administrations in the university. If not, just tell me what else could have inhibited the V-C from rebuilding the place he once lived as a student.\n\n\u201cThe situation is equally affecting other hostels in the university. You must have heard about the disturbing state of hostels within the campus. This is part of the strategy to force students to live in private hostels,\u201d Ugwuh said.\n\nRevamping Zik\u2019s Flats viable?\n\nA senior member of staff of the university, who preferred anonymity, told The Nation that rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats would cost the university more than what it could earn in 20 years.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWe are talking about a project that is capital-intensive. Rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats alone will gulp more than N5 billion and after that, you begin to charge N12, 000 or N15, 000 accommodation fees per session. We\u2019re not even talking about maintaining the hostel itself which costs the university almost N100 million per session.\n\n\u201cEqually remember that the university pays for the costs of providing electricity, water, internet services, security, sewage maintenance, repairs and cleaning.\n\n\u201cI think this is one of the frightening reasons successive administrations, including the current administration of the University led by Prof. Charles Igwe, the Vice-Chancellor, have looked away from rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats.\u201d\n\nZik\u2019s family reacts\n\nIt is, however, no surprise that even the wife of the late Owelle of Onitsha and First Nigerian President, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Emeritus Professor Uche Azikiwe, and the entire Azikiwe family are in deep pains over the continued abandonment and deterioration of her husband\u2019s legacy.\n\nShe lamented the current state of Zik\u2019s Flats at the university, saying the dilapidation of the block of buildings given to the university by her late husband always moved her to tears each time she beheld the buildings.\n\nAccording to the spouse of the late sage, the asset was handed over to the university in 1989 by the Great Zik himself when he celebrated his 85th birthday as part of his investments in human capital development.\n\nOptions for reviving Zik\u2019s Flats\n\nIn a chat with The Nation in Zik\u2019s Onuiyi Haven in Nsukka, Prof. Azikiwe expressed displeasure that successive administrations of the premier university in the country allowed such monumental infrastructure to waste when the institution was facing acute accommodation problems for students.\n\nShe said since the University was not capable of maintaining the structures, the estate should be given back to her family to rehabilitate, manage and transfer back to the university.\n\nShe stated that it was a great disservice to the name of her husband to be associated with the ruins the flats had become.\n\nAzikiwe said since her Onuiyi Haven shared a common fence with the flats, she has missed the hustle and bustle and warmth of students\u2019 presence in the flats.\n\n\u201cThen, in 1989 when my husband celebrated his 85 birthday, he gave out the place to the university for a token. I can\u2019t even remember what it was. If you call it a sale, people might laugh at us. When my husband and I were discussing after the transaction, he told me that he decided to give the hostels out to the University \u2018for a Song\u2019 because, in Igbo land, you don\u2019t give out something like that without records. His thoughts were that the hostels would help the university community.\n\n\u201cAfter my husband passed on in 1996, we started noticing that Zik\u2019s Flats are facing gradual deterioration.\n\n\u201cIt was when the place was finally abandoned that people started asking us questions about renovation; thinking it was still our property. I kept telling them that it was the university\u2019s property to which they could not understand why the university should allow such an asset to deteriorate and waste.\n\n\u201cIf you look around, you will see private hostels flourishing and each self-contained room costs from N140, 000 and above.\n\n\u2018No legal battle over Zik\u2019s Flats\u2019\n\nOn insinuations with regard to an alleged legal battle between the Azikiwe family and the university that was stalling the rebuilding of the estate, Azikiwe said the family was not in any legal battle with UNN, over the control of Zik\u2019s Flat.\n\nShe described the reports of the alleged legal impasse with UNN over control of Zik\u2019s Flats as currently spread on social media as only existing in the figments of the imaginations of mischief-makers.\n\nWhile describing the allegation as fake news, she added that her heart bleeds each time she sees the level of dilapidation at the facility.\n\nHer words: \u201cOne of my friends who had a shop at the flats came to me and said she heard that our family (Azikiwe) took the university to court over control of those hostels. I told her that there was nothing like that and that if anybody took the university to court over anything, it is not the Azikiwe family.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that the family didn\u2019t take the university to court. The property belongs to the university. It is the responsibility of the university to maintain, rebuild, reconstruct and manage the facility.\u201d\n\nShe noted, however, that her family had approached the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Benjamin Ozurumba for a possible takeover and renovation but nothing positive came out of it.\n\n\u201cAt a point during the tenure of the former V-C, Prof. Ozulumba, I contacted him and asked to know why the buildings have remained like that. I am not happy each time I hear the noise coming from that place each time it is windy or raining.\n\n\u201cI always walk around the perimeter fence every morning and evening as part of my exercise. It\u2019s either you see fallen roofs and planks with nails or you see snakes that come from there to our premises. I told him (the V-C) that I am not happy about this. I don\u2019t know why the university should allow this huge source of income and source of accommodation for students to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cThe former V-C told me about an arrangement with a housing firm to build, operate, and transfer (BOT). His tenure ended without any work.\n\n\u201cI have also complained to the new V-C, Prof. Igwe and requested for the family to take over the facilities to build, operate, and transfer so that this legacy will not go down.\n\nThat Zik\u2019s legacy will not go down\n\nThis is a very big legacy that Zik\u2019s family will prevent from going down. If they can\u2019t do it, they should let us know so that we can get property developers to do it and hand it over when they would have recovered their money. If they don\u2019t want it, we can take it over.\n\n\u201cWittily, the current V-C told me that he was one of the students that sang that night in front of our gate when it was falsely reported that my husband had passed on in 1989. He was living in Zik\u2019s Flat then.\n\n\u201cI implored him to do something so that it would be one of the legacies his administration would be remembered for.\u201d\n\nThe former lecturer in the university said the Azikiwe family should continue to explore every possible avenue to ensure the rehabilitation of the buildings to befit the name of her husband, after which the buildings were named.\n\nWhen confronted with questions about the ruins in the facility, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Igwe declined to comment. Igwe, who was at a one-day workshop organised by the Resource and Environmental Policy Research Centre (REPRC) of the University and Environment for Development (EfD) Initiative Nigeria, for journalists and environment reporters, rather told our correspondent that he would not make comments on that because the forum was not a place to talk to journalists about Zik\u2019s Flats.\n\nAlso, efforts to get the reaction from the university\u2019s spokesman, Dr Okwun Omeaku on the matter failed.\n\nOmeaku rather told our correspondent that he was not competent enough to talk about the issue, adding that it was only the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration) that had the authority to speak to the press on the matter.\n\nHowever, after almost two months of appointments with the DVC through the Public Relations Officer of the university, the DVC was not available for reactions.\n\nDr Omeaku would later inform our correspondent that meeting with the DVC would be a chance game, and through his words, the DVC was not available on each visit.",
          "summary": "However, the most debilitating is Zik\u2019s Flats.\n\u201cAnd to think that most of the Vice-Chancellors in recent times, including the current V-C, Prof. Igwe, were occupants of Zik\u2019s Flats makes the rumours strongly believable.\nRebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats alone will gulp more than N5 billion and after that, you begin to charge N12, 000 or N15, 000 accommodation fees per session.\n\u201cAfter my husband passed on in 1996, we started noticing that Zik\u2019s Flats are facing gradual deterioration.\nThat Zik\u2019s legacy will not go downThis is a very big legacy that Zik\u2019s family will prevent from going down.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: I\u2019m set to begin consultations \u2013Gov. Tambuwal",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nChairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum and governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has said that Nigeria must restructure now to have stability, growth and development.\n\nHe spoke to some journalists in Sokoto on a wide range of issues, including what his administration is doing to stop flashes of insecurity in the state. Excerpt:\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nYou operated at the national level as a Speaker of the House of Representatives and now you are the governor of your state; what is the experience like being at the national level and coming back home as governor?\n\nThank you very much for this opportunity and welcome to Sokoto. It is like you are talking about two different worlds; the House of Representatives at the National Assembly and then Sokoto State. In the House of Representatives, you have representations from 306 constituencies of Nigeria who are from different and diverse backgrounds. Coming with them are different degrees of experiences; some definitely older than you, some with more academic laurels than you, some richer and wealthier than you and some younger than you. But all are holding equal mandate representing their constituencies with different worldviews and perspectives on issues and all of that. Here in Sokoto, one can say that the people in the state are largely from the same background even though you have the Fulani, Hausa, Zabarmawa, some Kanuris and other Nigerians that are here living with us. It is not the same with what you have at the National Assembly. When you talk about leading the two, where, by the grace of God and the support of my colleagues, I served as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and here that I am serving currently as governor in the last six years, they are different. First is the constitutional role and second, you are dealing with two different sets of people if I may put it that way. Yes, even here, some people are richer than me, some are more educated, but in terms of close contact and micromanaging, it is a different ball game. At the House of Representatives, you are first among equals as the Speaker, but in the state, it is not the same scenario. In the state, you are the chief executive, so it is a different scenario and not as if you are just first among equals. That alone tells you that the experiences are not the same. As governor, I can say you deal more closely with the minutest of issues. As governor, if somebody\u2019s wife has a stillbirth, they say it is you; if their tap is running, they say it is the governor. So, it is not the same experience either as a parliamentarian at that level or even as a Speaker. That is why I said they are two different worlds and experiences. That relationship, solidarity and working together like school mates exists at the House unlike here where I am the chief executive virtually; minus my deputy who was elected alongside with me, every other person is my appointee. It is part of what I am missing and, of course, the debate. Most times at the House, you are always talking about national and bigger issues.\n\nSecurity is gradually becoming an issue in Sokoto which hitherto used to be one of the most peaceful states in the country. What is really happening and what is your administration doing to curb the menace?\n\nWell, before you ask me what is happening and what I am doing to curtail it, I will give you a background of how we got to where we are at the moment. Unfortunately, Zamfara State has been the epicenter of banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest. Most of the states including Niger really are getting the heat from Zamfara. And what is the distance of Zamfara to Sokoto? Almost about 14 local governments are either neighbouring Zamfara or Niger Republic. And what is happening in the Sahel region, which of course includes Mali, Niger and Central Africa is permeating and creeping into Nigeria. Talking about banditry, ISWAP and all of that, all these agents of instability that are carrying out activities in the Sahel region have a way of finding themselves through our porous borders into Nigeria. So, one by geography as neighbours to Niger Republic is part of the problem and secondly being neighbour to Zamfara, the epicenter of banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest. And to a large extent, especially recently, the inability of the security agents or agencies to coordinate their efforts and operations in Zamfara against our own advice by governors of eight states. We have met the president several times in the last three, four years. We even advised Service Chiefs that whenever you decide to undertake this large scale operation, let it be simultaneous. Have a blocking force in parts of Kaduna, Niger, Kebbi, Katsina and Sokoto, and carry out the operations simultaneously. They did not do that. Secondly, the timing for operation at the peak of the rainy season. One is that the forest is thick; two is that the military and other security agencies do not have the equipment that can move into those difficult terrains. That also did not help matters. So, whenever they carry out an operation and attack on the bandits in the camps, they pander towards states that are close to Zamfara. Instead of the security agencies to get them and do away with them in Zamfara, they disperse them into our state. And most of those that came in to attack our people are as a result of those operations recently. Another also is the fact that as I said before, they do not have enough manpower, firepower and equipment to carry out the operations. So, it is not as if it was about the people of Sokoto State. It is more to do with the situation of our neighbours. Then when you talk about what we have done, there has been a lot of synergy among the agencies in Sokoto State. I must commend the security agencies. We have been working together with them with regards to addressing the challenges. We do the much we can and we are still doing a lot because there was never a time any of the agencies approached us for support without getting it. In the last four, five years, we had given out not less than 500 vehicles to security services in Sokoto State. It is on record. How many states have done that? And as I said, we pay them their allowances from our coffers; we are up to date in paying those allowances. I believe you can check what I am going to tell you. We have refurbished all the divisional police headquarters. We are building about 12 new ones for them. So, we have given them every support. We are not sleeping; we have a standing committee that was established under his Eminence (you know he is a retired General), that is also working on the issue of security in the state. We hold regular security meetings. Even two, three days ago, we held one when we took a decision on outlawing self-styled vigilante groups because they were part of the problems in Zamfara State. Again, you know the limitations of every governor in Nigeria. So, for everybody to imagine it as if a governor is not doing what he ought to do, nobody can do what I have told you. I have not seen any governor who has taken a matchete and not to talk of a gun and pursued a bandit or Boko Haram in the bush. At best, it is to support the security agencies and the IDPs.\n\nAre there plans for a regional outfit to contain the insecurity situation?\n\nI told you that over the years, four, five years ago, we had Northern governors meeting and we had Nigerian governors meeting and we have had sub-regional meetings. At a point in time, each of us contributed N100 million for operations to be carried out in the affected areas. And for those neighbouring Niger Republic, we have also been having meetings with our colleagues from Niger Republic; we go there and they come here. So, it is not as if we have not been having regional cooperation. On the issue of forming a regional outfit, we have not discussed that because of the perception problem associated with that. But what we have done and we are working with the security agencies is that we try to strengthen our vigilantes at every state level and allow them to work with the security services. The Amotekun or Ebubeagu are not better than the vigilante groups. They are just a similar version of the vigilantes. What we are doing is putting them under some training by the police and then supporting the security services.\n\nSouthern governors met and said that the 2023 presidency should come from the South, and we know that you may want to join the race in the next general election, what is your view on that?\n\nLet me tell you this; I think we need to get that clear. When you look at my history, I find it difficult to talk about zoning. First, when I got to the House of Representatives in 2003, the ANPP caucus was not comfortable with the leadership style of the then leader of the caucus, the minority leader of the House. Sometime in 2005, there was a change in leadership and at that time, the ANPP had zoned the four principal officers\u2019 positions as follows; Minority Leader, Kano, Kaduna; Whip, Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara; Deputy Leader, Borno, Yobo because that was where you had ANPP; and Deputy Whip to South-south. We had Etiebet from Akwa Ibom. Based on that arrangement, the leaders of the ANPP caucus emerged. When members felt they were no longer comfortable with Dr Salik Ahmed Salik and there was a change, they themselves altered the zoning arrangement. Don Etiebet, the then chairman of the party issued a statement disagreeing with members of the House of Representatives that they must go back to zoning. Meanwhile, the rules of the House provided that the leadership should emerge from among members. So, relying on that, nobody carried out the change of guard and I came; even though I came from the bloc that was supposed to be the Whip of the House by the arrangement of the ANPP caucus, I became the leader against zoning. In 2011, the PDP zoned the Speakership position to the Southwest, but members of the House of Reps came together to say look, we are looking for a Speaker with so and so qualities. They approached me and all that went on, and I emerged the Speaker of the House; not from the Southwest. Clearly from the two scenarios, based on the assessment of members, and in their own criteria the type of leader they were looking for, I enjoyed those two privileges in the past. That is why I said that based on my history, I find it difficult to talk about zoning. But when you talk about what my brother governors from the South said, they are entitled to their opinion. When the Northern governors met in Kaduna, they said their own. But it is now for the political parties to sit down, look at the issues and plan how to win elections. The bottom-line for any political party is how to win elections. When you are talking about democracy and elections, you must think about demography; where are you going to get the votes?\n\nWill you again join the presidential race in 2023?\n\nWhy are you asking me that question?\n\nYou know that in 2018, I participated in the PDP primaries that held in Port Harcourt and I thank God that I came second. Several people are talking to me to give it a trial. At this moment, what I can tell you is that very soon, I am going to commence my consultations and whatever is the feedback I get and with prayers, I will let my position be known.\n\nThe Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission has been going around to change their ratings for states; are you happy with where Sokoto is on the table?\n\nIt is not about Sokoto. No state is happy with where it is. Not even Lagos or Rivers; so, if Lagos and Rivers are not happy with where they are, how do you want Sokoto and others to feel? We are all looking for money and resources. Not even the Federal Government is happy with where it is. They have the lion share, but they are looking for resources. Go and ask them; they borrow money to pay salaries. So, it is not about Sokoto, but what people have been talking about the need for restructuring and devolution of powers in the country. We must review and restructure away all those things from the centre. I said it at the PDP retreat. It is first our pathway to stability, growth and development. The Federal Government must shed weight and devolve more powers to sub-nationals where the people are in the states and local governments. That would give less attraction to the centre. Let the Federal Government be dealing with issues of immigration and other normal issues that a federal system should be concerned about.\n\nThere are still many big ongoing projects in your state when you have less than two more years to go; do you think you will be able to finish the projects with the time available to you or will you leave some of them as \u2018abandoned projects\u2019?\n\nAre you worried about the timing or the resources? Minus any unforeseen developments, as we say in law, Force Majeure (COVID-19 was a Force Majeure as it slowed down a lot of things in the world), I can assure you by the grace of God, all of the projects you have seen and those you have not seen are going to be completed by this administration. About timelines, that is why we are committed and we have resources that we are working hard to ensure that we complete all the projects.\n\nHave you been able to improve the Internally Generated Revenue(IGR) of the state since you came in?\n\nWe have. It was very low until recently because we have introduced a lot of reforms with the state revenue services. We have new laws and rates that we are charging and the management has been turned around. And the level of awareness has been raised that you have to have more money for government to be able to carry out its responsibilities. And the confidence of the people to have a buy in, in generating more revenue is also increased because in the past, they were worried and concerned about whether people would agree to introducing rates or taxes because there was not that confidence that the resources would be judiciously used; and the prudence of management of resources we have been able to do in the past. This is a state where we do not owe salaries, pension and we are still doing what we are doing. Members of the public are aware that we are not squandering their scarce resources. We are micro-managing and managing the resources effectively. So, they are getting value for whatever taxes they are paying. The trust level of the people on the government has been increased.\n\nYou are not owing and projects are going on; people would ask, how are you getting the resources?\n\nAs I said initially, the key to the whole thing is planning; we plan how to raise money and part of it is the management of what we get from IGR and with augmentation from some loans that we have from both banks and other financial institutions. And most of it, are payable within the lifespan of this administration. You know that banks and financial institutions would not lend money to you unless they are sure that you are healthy and that you can carry it. In any case, they would do the background check to assess and even agree to endorse your request. So, it is a combination of the resources from the FAC, IGR loans from banks and financial institutions.\n\nIs there a reason that you have consistently allocated more funds to education and health sectors of your state?\n\nYou know that the indices on education development of Sokoto State are not encouraging. By the time we came in, we had about 1.6 million out of school children. Also, the indices in our healthcare are not good. So, we did that as a deliberate measure to upscale the quality, numeracy of education in the state, and to address the challenges of Almajarai and out of school. Yes, because, it is when they are out of school that they engage in all forms of criminality. It is because of this that we decided as a government that we must give priority to education and human capital development. Second, healthcare is of paramount importance. Without a healthy society, you cannot go anywhere. As I have said, the indices have not been good. At a point in time even before I came in, so many of our development partners had written us off because of their experience with the immediate past administration in terms of collaboration, partnership in working together to address some of these challenges in healthcare. By the time we came in, they saw that yes, these are people they could actually do business with. They came back and we assembled experts both in education, healthcare and agriculture. In dealing with our tertiary institutions under education, we set up a committee under Prof Attahiru Jega who advised us on the way to manage our tertiary institutions. So, the reports from these committees, guided and are still guiding our steps in the education sector; be it at basic, secondary or tertiary level. The same thing happened and is happening in healthcare and so also in agriculture. So, we saw the gaps and challenges and the need to really do more in education and healthcare. That is why we have been consistently prioritizing education, healthcare and agriculture in that order.\n\nDid the committees you set up lead to the establishment of the Child Rights Act in your state?\n\nThe Child Rights Act has been on the card and table of virtually every government, year in, year out, time in, time out, even in Sokoto State. The Child Rights Act was passed by the National Assembly in 2004. It was not passed because of certain considerations that had to do with culture, religion and belief of the people. So, we had to do a lot of sensitization with the Ulamas, religious leaders and community leaders under the able leadership and guidance of His eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto. It was for us to convince members of the public that look, nobody is trying to Westernise your child by passing the Child Rights law; that was how we were able to build the consensus for us to be able to pass it at the Executive Council level.\n\nBut do you foresee problems in enforcing it?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nAs I said during the signing ceremony, all of the concerns have been addressed by the committee. It is not as if we adopted the Act the way it was without attempting to fine-tune and domesticate it in consonance with the culture and religion of the people. So, I do not see any difficulties. By the way, before even we signed that law, I believe that Sokoto was either the first or very first states in Nigeria to sign a law that made basic education compulsory to every child. So, it is not as if Sokoto is new to it or that the whole idea is coming as a new thing to Sokoto State. We have the contributory health scheme. When you talk about health insurance like Sokoto communities especially, for those who have different understanding of it in terms of Islamic perspective, it is always difficult to convince people to do that. But we were able to do that with the guidance of His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto and other religious leaders to fine-tune the health insurance laws and make them adaptable to our own situation and we came up with the contributory health scheme. So, it is all about the approach and how you engage the people, how you sensitise and make them to understand and have a buy in of what you are trying to market to them. It also has a lot to do with their trust in the administration.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Peter Anosike\n\nAviation industry stakeholders have raised a red flag on the planned concession of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos; Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja; Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, and the Port Harcourt International Airport, Rivers State by the Federal Government.\n\nThe stakeholders are worried that the government is looking at concessioning the airports to foreign firms while there are tested indigenous firms that can do the job efficiently.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to them, besides the capital flight associated with using expatriate firms, the Federal Government may be unwittingly compromising the nation\u2019s security.\n\nThe airports, the stakeholders pointed out, are the gateway to every country, arguing that the architecture and operations of \u201csuch assets should be handled by nationals who have the security interest of the country at heart.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with newsmen, Mustapha Bello, a retired engineer with the defunct Nigeria Airways, advised that security and national interest should be the first consideration when handling national assets.\n\nHis words: \u201cNigeria should not forget the experience of Uganda during the reign of the late General Idi Amin.\n\n\u201cThe Entebbe raid was successfully carried out because the Israelis had the architectural plan of the Uganda Entebbe International Airport in their palm.\n\n\u201cSince there are some Nigerian companies who have successfully operated airports terminals like Bi-Courtney Aviation Services, who are currently running Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal 2, MMA2, Lagos, they should be considered first.\n\n\u201cThere is another successful Nigerian whose company is operating at the Gatwick Airport in United Kingdom, UK. Such companies owned by Nigerians should be considered first \u201c.\n\nAlso, another official of a Lagos-based aviation company, who pleaded anonymity, noted that indigenization of national assets is \u201cvery important in order to create jobs for the teeming population and prevent capital flight.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, it is necessary for the airports to be concessioned to local firms with track records, merit and competence, rather than foreign companies that you cannot vouch for.\n\n\u201cSome of the foreign companies being touted don\u2019t even have the required records.\n\n\u201cBi-Courtney Aviation Services, BASL, has proved to be the best private terminal manager in the last 14 years and so should be supported by government because of its antecedent in terminal management.\n\n\u201cLuckily, I was informed that they also bid for the terminals to be concessioned\u201d.\n\nWhen reminded that Bi-Courtney had been locked in legal battle with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and consequently, the Federal Government may be biased against the company in the bidding process, he said that most of the legal issues at MMA2 had been resolved in favour of BASL.\n\n\u201cThe late President Musa Yar \u2018Adua set up a reconciliation committee that resolved most of the disputed sections of the concession agreement.\n\n\u201cOn MMA2 terminal, as a stakeholder in the aviation sector, I learnt that from the outset, both parties, BASL and the Federal Government, set up a coordinating committee comprising BASL, FAAN and an independent body to address any challenge that may arise from the agreement on MMA2.\n\n\u201cOn each occasion that the committee was called to address some of the challenges emanating from the concession, judgments have been in favour of BASL,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had recently announced that at the end of the submission of interest to bid for the four international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano, some foreign companies also submitted bids.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that some of the foreign bidders in the process are said to be creating problems as they have been accused of breaching the process.\n\nAgain, Femi Falana\u2019s Chambers had written Sirika, alleging that three of the foreign bidders for the four airports to be concessioned violated the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (Est.) Act 2005 and the National Policy on Public-Private Partnership (N4P).\n\nThe law firm, therefore, called for the disqualification of the three firms from the bidding process to avoid litigation, which might derail the exercise.\n\nIn a letter signed by the legal firm to the Aviation Minister entitled: \u2018Request to Disqualify TAV Consortium, GMR Consortium, and ADP\u2019, it said it had confirmed that two consortia owned by ADP submitted an expression of interest.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cThe first consortium was led by TAV Airport Holding (where ADP owns 49 per cent) and the second submission was done by GMR Airports Limited (where ADP owns 46 per cent).\n\n\u201cWe are a firm of Legal Practitioners dedicated to the defense of human rights as well as the promotion of the rule of law and Public Accountability in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to the public notice published by the Ministry of Aviation sometime in August 2021 wherein Requests for Qualification (RFO) were invited for the Concession of four Airport Terminals in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kano in accordance with the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (Est.) Act 2005 and the National Policy on Public-Private Partnership (N4P).\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that it is expressly stated in Section 2.2 of the RFQ that no applicant single or a consortium can be part of more than one bid.\n\n\u201cSection 2.2.3 is further clarifying that the eligibility shall apply to an applicant and/or to the parties consisting of the applicant i.e. shareholders.\n\n\u201cContrary to the misleading impression that both TAV and GMR are separate entities, a search on the Internet has revealed that ADP owns 46 per cent of GMR and 49 per cent of TAV.\n\n\u201cHaving contravened the Requests for Qualification (RFO) without any legal basis whatsoever, the TAV-led consortium and the GMR submission as well as ADP as a stand alone party should be disqualified from participation in the tender.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that you will accede to our request to avoid any litigation over the proposed concession of the four airports terminals\u201d.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "*Bans non-UK, non-Irish citizens from Nigeria\n\n*FG, Afrexim Bank intensify talks on local vaccine production\n\n*Nigeria can\u2019t be ready to produce vaccine in one year, says Tomori\n\nEjiofor Alike, Chinedu Eze in Lagos and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nFollowing the 21 cases of Omicron variant of COVID-19 reported in England, which are linked to travel from Nigeria, the United Kingdom has announced a temporary measure to prevent further cases of the virus from entering the country from 4a.m. tomorrow (Monday).\n\nUnder the new measure, which would be reviewed after three weeks, the UK will tomorrow add Nigeria to the red list of countries from where people arriving must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron strain of COVID-19, Health Secretary, Mr. Sajid Javid, said yesterday.\n\nThis implies that from 4a.m. on Monday, UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nA temporary travel ban would therefore be introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents who have been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they will be refused entry into the UK.\n\nThis does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through Nigeria while changing flights.\n\nCanada had on Tuesday banned travellers from Egypt, Nigeria and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron variant.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has, however, intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next one year, according to the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire.\n\nHowever, a renowned Virologist and Chairman of the Board of the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited, Prof. Oyewale Tomori, has told THISDAY that the local production of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country may not be possible within the next one year despite the ongoing efforts to fast-track the process.\n\nSpeaking on the UK\u2019s decision, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing said:\u201cI know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year. This decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work.\u201d\n\nUK Health Secretary, Javid also stated that travellers heading to the UK would now have to take a COVID-19 test before their departure in an effort to limit spread of the virus.\n\nHe said the tightened requirements would come into force from Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, travellers would be required to submit evidence of a negative lateral flow or PCR test to enter the UK.\n\nJavid confirmed that Nigeria would be added to the red list of countries from where people arriving the UK must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\n\nBBC reported that currently travellers only need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving the UK.\n\nJavid said the government\u2019s strategy since the discovery of the Omnicron variant had been to \u201cbuy time\u201d to assess and to \u201cput in place protective measures\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve always said that we would act swiftly should new data require it\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver the recent days we have learnt of a significant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria\n\n\u201cThere are 27 cases already in England and that\u2019s growing and Nigeria now is second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron.\n\n\u201cSo today, the government has decided to add Nigeria to the travel red list and that will be effective from 4am on Monday. This will mean that only UK residents or citizens of the UK can enter the UK from Nigeria from that point onwards, and they would have to quarantine in one of the relevant hotels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also decided to require pre-departure tests for all inward travellers that will be effective from 4am on Tuesday, and they\u2019ll be required maximum of 48 hours before the departure time,\u201d he explained.\n\nUK said the new protocol does not apply to persons \u201cstaying airside and only transiting through\u201d.\n\nJavid added the government had \u201cbeen clear that we will take action if it is necessary,\u201d adding that it was important to remember vaccinations \u201care our first line of defence\u201d and calling on people to get a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine when called to do so by the NHS.\n\nThe moves come after pressure on the government to tighten the policy had been growing over the course of the week.\n\nLast week the government\u2019s scientific advisory body Sage, said pre-departure tests for those arriving in the UK would be valuable, in the leaked minutes of a meeting seen by the BBC.\n\nThe Labour Party had previously criticised the government\u2019s current testing policy and called for the reintroduction of pre-departure tests.\n\nWhile Labour has pushed for pre-departure testing to avoid Omicron spreading, travel businesses will see it as a significant setback \u2013 just when green shoots of recovery were emerging.\n\nAirlines have supported the red list re-introduction and extension.\n\nBut they view the introduction of blanket restrictions as unnecessary and ineffective.\n\nFG, Afrexim Bank Intensify Talks on Local COVID-19 Vaccine Production\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next year, the Minister of Health, Ehanire, has said.\n\nEhanire disclosed at the weekend that the federal government had been meeting with the top officials of the Afrexim Bank to secure their financial support to fast-track the process of reviving vaccine production in Nigeria.\n\nPart of the readiness for local production of vaccines is the meeting of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\nDirector-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojishola Adeyeye, had stated that the country had met the 868 requirements demanded by the WHO to qualify for the production of vaccines in the country.\n\nHowever, Adeyeye added that WHO would still send an assessment team in a couple of months to verify things before formal certification would be given to Nigeria.\n\nEhanire noted in his speech at the special session of the National Council of Health that took place in Abuja, that one of the lessons, Nigeria had learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was the need to develop a minimum level of self-sufficiency in medical infrastructure.\n\nThe minister who was referring to the difficulties encountered by Nigeria in the procurement of basic treatment tools during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and is still experiencing it with regards to vaccine procurement, said: \u201cIt has been said that COVID-19 has been an eye-opener for the country. It has its realities, which we all have to adjust to. The first is that there is no way we can rest on our oars and believe that we have won. There is no way we can believe that nothing is happening. We all must agree to strengthen our health system and be prepared to tackle any of the health challenges.\n\n\u201cAt the time we were looking items like personal protective equipment, reagents, and other commodities, we realised that when push comes to shove, most of these countries would like to take care of themselves before considering even their friends and therefore we have realised that we need some level self-sufficiency\u201d.\n\nEhanire said that the federal government was pleased that in many ways the country is responding to the challenge and that industries have sprung up to produce personal protective equipment, hand sanitisers.\n\n\u201cOur research institutes have been able to develop equipment and materials. So, we are on a good way into that and our research Institutes have developed equipment and materials They have also been able to carry out sequencing and reagents and are on the way to making vaccines.\u201d\n\nHe said his ministry is working with the NCDC, Nigeria Medical Research, in Lagos, and the Centre for Excellence in Ede, Osun State, and trying to get the best from them.\n\nConcerning local vaccine production, Ehanire said the government was determined to achieve that.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited and I met with the Managing Director of the firm today and urged him to speed up all the processes for us to use the opportunities and support we have from outside this country to enhance the manufacture of vaccines.\n\n\u201cI also received the President of Afriexim Bank yesterday to discuss a few things. Part of it is the mopping up support in the area of vaccine production and when the details are clear we will be able to announce.\u201d\n\nEhanire said that the vaccine production is not just for COVID-19 but vaccines against various diseases, adding also that the country wants to be able to tackle future health emergencies as they emerge.\n\nThe minister said that part of what the government is trying to deal with is to clear the erroneous perception that the foreign partners said that Nigeria does not have anything on the ground.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a veterinary vaccine plant in Jos,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria once had a human vaccine factory, which was shut down for maintenance.\n\nThe minister promised that the government was working to revive the vaccine production facility.\n\nHe said that it requires technical expertise and funds to pull through with the venture.\n\nBut Tomori, who is also a former President of the Nigeria Academy of Science, (NAS), told THISDAY in a telephone interview at the weekend that the country may not be ready to produce the vaccine within one year.\n\nTomori said that Bio-Vaccine Company is already taking steps to speed up the process, pointing out, however, that to get the structures and equipment ready for commencement of local vaccine production would probably exceed the one-year target.\n\n\u201cBio-vaccine is already fast-tracking steps to produce vaccines locally. Even if the buildings and structures are ready today, you will need more than a year to begin vaccine manufacturing. And the buildings are not ready yet,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Opposition party shifts inauguration of Ayu, others to Friday\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is palpable tension within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the Supreme Court will tomorrow hear the appeal filed by the sacked National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, asking the apex court to quash his removal from office, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the apex court may also decide to rule on the matter tomorrow, or later within the week.\n\nIt was learnt that the fear that the decision of the Supreme Court may affect the recent National Convention of the party has led the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of the Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) from Thursday, December 9 to Friday, December 10.\n\nThe National Chairman-designate of the party, Ayu, and other members of the NWC were elected at the October 30 and 31 National Convention of the party after Secondus was removed from office.\n\nSecondus wants the Supreme Court to interpret the PDP constitution as it concerns the power of the party to sack a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC), particularly, the national chairman of the party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, it was gathered, will hear Secondus\u2019 petitions on Monday, December 6.\n\nSecondus had filed a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court asking it to declare that he is the only one who had the legal right to preside over the last national convention.\n\nHe is also seeking an order declaring that his suspension at the ward level was not enough reason for him to vacate the office of the national chairman of the party.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, some members of the party had instituted a suit marked: PHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division, with Secondus and the PDP as defendants.\n\nThe applicants had asked the court to stop Secondus from parading himself as the PDP chairman as he had been suspended at his ward.\n\nThe court subsequently restrained Secondus from performing the functions of the office of the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nSecondus, however, filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal, demanding that his suspension be declared illegal and the party be prevented from holding its October 30 and 31 conventions unless he was allowed to preside over the exercise.\n\nBut his appeal was thrown out and the appellate court gave the PDP the green light to hold its convention.\n\nAt the national convention, a former Senate President, Ayu, emerged as the chairman-designate of the party, and his inauguration along with other members of the NWC was initially fixed for December 9, 2021.\n\nHowever, Secondus is now praying for the Supreme Court to declare that the appellate court erred in its judgment.\n\nAccording to the appeal filed by his lawyer, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), there are three grounds for appeal.\n\nSecondus said Section 222(c) of the Nigerian Constitution requires every political party to have a constitution, which shall be registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to him, Article 35(1) (b) of the PDP\u2019s Constitution confers on the national chairman of the party the right to preside over the national convention, but the appellate court gave the party the right to hold the convention without him.\n\nThe embattled chairman also argued that the fact that he was suspended at his ward did not translate to him being suspended as the chairman of the PDP.\n\nHis notice of appeal to the apex court read in part: \u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law when it held that the appellant had no legal right or interest to protect by his application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law and violated the appellant\u2019s right to a fair hearing when it held that the appellant, having been suspended as a member of the 6th respondent (the PDP), could not continue to function as the national chairman.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law in dismissing the appellant\u2019s application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\u201d\n\nSecondus subsequently sought four reliefs, including an order allowing the appeal, an order setting aside the decision of the appellate court, and order confirming that Article 35(I) (b) of the PDP Constitution confers on him the personal right to preside over the convention of the party.\n\nIt is feared that if the Supreme Court grants Secondus\u2019 prayers, the election of Ayu and other members of the NWC, as well as all other actions taken by the party in his absence will become null and void.\n\nThis fear may have informed the decision of the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of Ayu and other members of the NWC from December 9 to December 10.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Governor of Adamawa State, Hon. Ahmad Fintiri, who was the Chairman, National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC), \u201cthe swearing-in of the newly elected National Officers of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), earlier scheduled for Thursday, December 9, 2021, has been rescheduled for Friday, December 10, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cAll party leaders, stakeholders, and members nationwide are advised to note this accordingly, please.\n\nFintiri\u2019s statement was titled: \u2018Change of Date for the Presentation of Certificate of Return and Swearing-in Ceremony of the Newly Elected PDP National Officers.\u2019\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Nine-month petrol subsidy payments gulp N1.027tn\n\n*FG vows to tackle cooking gas price hike\n\n*Says PIA will boost per capita consumption of the product\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited will again make a deduction of roughly N200 billion from the joint federal, state, and local government account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets later this month to share the statutory monthly allocation.\n\nAn analysis of the document by THISDAY, detailing the presentation of the national oil company to FAAC in November, indicated that the N200 billion will be the highest amount deducted by the NNPC since it resumed payment of petroleum subsidies in February this year.\n\nIn all, it further showed that the NNPC has netted off at least N1.027 trillion from monies accruing to the three tiers of government in the country between February and October as payment for the controversial petrol under-recovery.\n\nTo encourage the use of gas as domestic and vehicular fuels, the federal government has said it was leveraging the pricing framework and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support the use of gas among vulnerable Nigerians to tackle the price hike.\n\nWhile lamenting that the North-west zone of the country consumes only four per cent of the cooking gas consumed in the country, the federal government also stated that the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) of 2021 would increase the per capita consumption of gas in Nigeria.\n\nA breakdown of the various deductions indicated that payments have increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as a subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion.\n\nIn July, the document stated that N103.2 billion was spent on what the government terms under-recovery.\n\nAugust had the year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion.\n\nHowever, this will be overtaken by the N200 billion planned deduction later this month, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion.\n\nHowever, the overall crude oil lifting by the newly rechristened company almost doubled in September, according to the national oil company during the presentation which held on the 17th of November.\n\nIn addition, the presentation signed by Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, Umar Ajiya, noted that for October, the NNPC spent over N7.7 billion on its strategic holdings and fixing of its pipelines.\n\nBesides, the NNPC stated that product losses amounted to N143.3 billion, stressing that the \u201cvalue shortfall\u201d of nearly N200 billion would be subtracted later this month when the FAAC meeting holds.\n\nPart of the presentation obtained by THISDAY read: \u201cThe overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 11.49 Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in September 2021 recorded 98.5 per cent increase relative to the 5.79 Mbbls lifted in August 2021.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas and other receipts in the month was N6.78 billion. The domestic gas in the month was N4.07 billion. Feedstock valued at $59.43 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.57 million was received during the month.\n\nOn domestic crude and gas sales, it added: \u201cThe sum of N252,968,629,898.13 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe recoveries were: strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounting to N7,757,631,778.84, product losses worth N143,386,571.87, and value shortfall of N163,709,314,928.61. This comprised of the N123,709,314,928.61 for September 2021 and N40,000,000,000.00 value shortfall deferred in June 2021.\u201d\n\nFor November operations revenues which are due for sharing in November, the NNPC indicated that almost N200 billion will be netted off or removed as it had done in the previous months.\n\n\u201cThe October 2021 value shortfall of N199,007,758,422.75 is to be recovered from the November 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the December 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d it emphasised.\n\nOn its other receipts, the national oil company noted that the sum of $95.63 million being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees as well as interest income was received in October 2021.\n\nCompared to the previous month, the overall NNPC crude oil lifting was 5.79Mbbls in August 2021, a record of 33.5 per cent decrease relative to the 8.71Mbbls lifted in July 2021.\n\nThe NNPC said that Nigeria recorded 1.417 barrels per day million production in September 2021, just like it did in August 2021, adding that while crude oil export revenue received in September 2021 amounted to $8.38 million equivalent of N3.22 billion, for October \u201cthere was no crude export revenue\u201d.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally, so almost all the revenues are spent importing petrol and paying subsidies, even for neighbouring countries where the product is smuggled into.\n\nOn November 23, the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, projected that petrol would sell for between N320 and N340 per litre from February, next year.\n\nStressing that Nigeria would be out of the subsidy regime in the first quarter of 2022, Kyari explained that subsidy would have been eliminated this year, but for certain (unnamed) factors that prevented it.\n\nTo ameliorate the impact of the petrol subsidy, the federal government said it was planning to give N5,000 each to 40 million poor Nigerians.\n\nThis proposition has been rejected by many Nigerians who believe there\u2019s no sense in replacing a lesser subsidy with a much more burdensome one.\n\nIn addition, the labour unions have cautioned the federal government against unilateral removal or stoppage of the petrol subsidy regime, warning that removing it without meeting labour\u2019s demands will be met with stiff resistance.\n\n\u201cThere will be no provision for it (subsidy) legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit most subtly and easily,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nThe NNPC boss spoke during the presentation of the November edition of the World Bank Nigeria Development Update, titled: \u201cTime for Business Unusual.\u201d\n\nIn August, Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, speaking on behalf of his colleagues in reaction to the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) signed by President Muhammadu Buhari said he didn\u2019t believe in the credibility of the subsidy figures churned out by the NNPC.\n\nFG Vows to Tackle Cooking Gas Price Hike\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government said it was leveraging the pricing framework and the CBN\u2019s gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support the offtake of gas among vulnerable Nigerians to tackle inflation.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, disclosed this yesterday during the inauguration of a 100-metric tonne LPG (cooking gas) storage and bottling plant, constructed by Butane Energy Limited in Kabukawa, Katsina State.\n\nSylva, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr. Sani Gwarzo, explained that the pricing of LPG was a major threat to gas affordability and penetration in the country.\n\nHe said the declaration of Decade of Gas by President Muhammadu Buhari, was to reinforce Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to leverage on its gas resources estimated at 206 TCF to develop the country\u2019s national industrial, commercial and agricultural base.\n\nHe reiterated that the federal government had embarked on numerous gas-based initiatives such as the Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme, the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP), and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Pipeline to accelerate economic development.\n\n\u201cI cannot conclude this speech without touching on gas pricing which is a major threat to gas affordability and gas penetration.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is leveraging on the gas pricing framework and the CBN gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support offtake of gas especially among vulnerable groups\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe deliberate focus of this administration to develop the gas sector is largely the driving force behind NCDMB commercial intervention in partnering with the private sector, to establish Butane LPG bottling plant in several northern states including Katsina, Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi, Niger, and the FCT,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister averred that the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021 by President Buhari has reinforced the government\u2019s commitment to transform the oil and gas industry by creating an enabling environment for accelerated investment in exploration and field development projects.\n\nThis, he said, would pave the way for the integration of host communities into the benefit plans of the industry and entrenchment of local content as the driving philosophy for oil and gas transactions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the PIA and the intensive investment in gas transportation, storage, and marketing infrastructure will no doubt increase per capita consumption of gas in Nigeria which currently stands at 80 cubic meters per capita consumption despite our huge gas reserves\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, said despite the utilisation of 1,000,000 metric tonnes of LPG in 2020, Nigeria has one of the lowest per capita LPG consumption in Africa.\n\nHe affirmed that available data from the office of the National Gas Expansion Programme revealed that LPG utilisation in the North-west was four per cent compared to 14 per cent in the South-west and 15 per cent in the South-east.\n\n\u201cThat is why we chose to partner Butane Energy to increase the level of LPG utilisation in the North as they understand the market in the region, possess the technical capability and the determination to embark on such a venture,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of Butane Energy Limited, Mr. Isa Inuwa, said by September, the company would have five gas plants with a total storage capacity of 820 metric tonnes.\n\nHe noted that the five gas plants would be located in Kano, Katsina, Kaduna,

          "text": "* Investors commit N412bn to 35 Nigerian startups in 10 months\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared that Nigeria remains the most viable and attractive investment destination in Africa.\n\nBuhari also said Nigeria is on the path of becoming Africa\u2019s leading industrial and trading nation.\n\nThis is coming as some foreign and local investors have invested a total of N412billion ($992million) across 35 Nigerian startups in the first 10 months of 2021.\n\nThe president, who stated these in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) while addressing a trade and investment forum at Dubai Expo 2020, said Nigeria is reaping from the efforts his administration has made to consciously improve the investment environment.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria\u2019s pavilion at the Expo 2020 clearly shows why we remain the most viable and attractive investment destination in Africa. Our location, our natural resources, our population, and our regulations are there for all to see.\n\nNigeria is on its way to become a leading industrial and trading nation in Africa. To achieve this, our government focused on policies, projects and programs that support private sector investors.\n\n\u201cWe introduced numerous fiscal incentives and infrastructure projects aimed at enhancing the viability of investments.\n\n\u201cDespite the adverse global economic environment of recent years, Nigeria\u2019s investment environment has greatly improved both at the national and sub-national levels,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari assured captains of industry, and entrepreneurs, who have shown interest and commitment to further enhance trade and investment relations with Nigeria, that his administration would continue to work with them to improve the business climate especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) comes into full effect.\n\n\u201cJust last month at the Intra Africa Trade fair in Durban, I reminded business leaders that most of Africa\u2019s challenges, whether security, economic or corruption, can be traced to our inability to domesticate the production of our most basic requirements and provide jobs to our teeming and dynamic youth population.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that this Forum focuses on \u2018Unveiling Trade and Investment Opportunities in Nigeria,\u2019 and will encourage you all to keep an open mind and look beyond the challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this room, we have governors, ministers and heads of government agencies that can address all your questions and concerns.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are here to support you and I hope you will all take this opportunity to move your investment decisions forward,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also used the occasion to express profound gratitude to his hosts, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates and the Emir of Abu Dhabi, for their unwavering commitment to strengthen trade and investment relations between both countries through various initiatives, partnerships and support.\n\nInvestors Commit N412bn to 35 Nigerian Startups in 10months\n\nMeanwhile, some foreign and local investors have invested a combined sum of N412billion ($992million) across 35 Nigerian startups in the first 10 months of 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Google has pledged to invest $1billion in Africa over the next five years aimed at promoting digital transformation and innovation across the continent.\n\nThe Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), which disclosed this in its monthly economic report for December, described the rising interest in Nigerian startups as a good omen for the Nigerian economy.\n\nStartup traditionally refers to a company still in its early stages of operations.\n\nThe report noted that on its part, the federal government has developed the Nigerian Startup Bill, which is on its way to the Senate for approval, adding that if passed, the bill will empower the Nigerian tech ecosystem by fostering cooperation between stakeholders in the startup space and Nigerian regulators to ensure that subsequent laws and regulations are in line with the best interests of the sector.\n\nAccording to the report, the development is an indication that Nigeria, in recent years, has witnessed the advent of a new type of company, one more forward-looking and technologically savvy than those of the past.\n\n\u201cThese companies typically leverage technology to disrupt already established industries and offer a new standard of value to consumers,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt explained that these companies, apart from obviously creating employment opportunities, bring huge swaths of foreign capital and investments into the country. A number of them also help to solve burning societal and economic issues that impede the living standards of many Nigerians.\n\nFDC believed that \u201cThe copious amount of startup firms with decent value propositions, and the availability of a large market with active demand for their service offerings, coupled with the large in the flux of foreign capital, all illustrate the fact that we are at the genesis of the golden age of startups in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the global boom in startup popularity is not exclusive to Nigeria or the West, Africa currently has about 577 registered startup companies.\n\nNigeria is said to have accounted for the second-highest number of these at 144, just behind South Africa which has 154 startups.\n\nBy far the most popular startups in Africa are the tech startups, consisting of fintech, e-commerce, e-health, ed-tech, and agri-tech among others.\n\nIn 2020, African tech startups raised a combined sum of $701.41million; $625.66million (89.2 per cent) of that went to the \u2018big four\u2019 African technology investment destinations \u2013 Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt.\n\nThe FDC said that the number of Nigerian startups that secured investments in 2020 represented a 77 per cent increase from the number recorded in 2019, which was 48.\n\nIt added that the Nigerian startup funding has risen every year since 2016, with 2020 representing a 22.8 per cent increase from funding secured in 2019.\n\nThis trend is projected to continue as estimated funding secured in the third quarter of 2021 alone ($248million) surpassed the totality of funding secured in 2020 by 64.89 per cent.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, certain Nigerian startups distinguished themselves from the pack by raising prodigious amounts compared to the rest of the startup industry. For example, Flutterwave, a fintech company, raised $35million in its series B funding round. Flutterwave would later go on to raise $170million in its series C round in 2021, which would elevate the company to Unicorn status. Fintech company Bitfxt and e-health firm, 54gene secured $15million each in 2020,\u201d the report said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "FG refuses to restrict inbound travellers over Omicron, approves vaccine booster jabs\n\nPCR test now to be done 48hrs before departure\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nWith the global surge in COVID-19 and its new Omicron variant, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday emphasised the urgent need for world leaders to work together and reinforce partnerships to limit the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, during Nigeria\u2019s Day at Dubai Expo 2020, the President declared that the theme of the global event, \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the Future\u201d, had placed a moral burden on all relevant stakeholders, across national boundaries, to urgently work together for a better and brighter future, by stemming COVID-19.\n\nOn the same day, amid the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the global audience at Dubai Expo 2020, said: \u201cThe concerted efforts by world leaders, working together, enabled us to limit the catastrophic consequences of this pandemic.\n\n\u201cSuch level of continuing understanding and pragmatic partnership are needed and must be reinforced to ensure that our world is a better place that addresses humanity\u2019s common challenges to guarantee sustainable development and progress for the global community.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the distinguished audience that Nigeria, like other countries in the world, was impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding national efforts in addressing insecurity, fighting corruption and diversifying the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that the present administration in Nigeria had registered significant progress within a short period of time \u201cand is still making headways\u201d in key sectors of the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, the Nigerian delegation is participating in this Expo with great prospects for positive outcomes, while assuring the world of our determination and readiness to partner with relevant investors in our bid to tackle a number of challenges to make Nigeria a better country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is participating in this epoch-making event in order to explore opportunities that are capable of unlocking the huge potentials that abound in our country, as it makes conscious efforts to be a strategic partner of choice for the global community.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure, therefore, to invite all participating countries, organisations and other private sector operators to take full advantage of opportunities being provided by the EXPO 2020, by linking up with the Nigerian team, to collaborate with us in diverse areas of interests for our mutual benefits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for inviting him to the Expo and especially to attend Nigeria\u2019s Day event, which offers a great opportunity to show-case the potential of Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nHe described Dubai Expo 2020 as the single most important global event of its kind to take place in the Middle East, Africa and the South East Asian regions in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be a part of this dynamic evolution of pragmatic partnerships that are both creative and innovative for the progress of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nFG Refuses to Restrict Inbound Travellers over Omicron\n\nNotwithstanding the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government yesterday unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nOmicron, identified as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, was recently detected by South African scientists.\n\nThe National Incident Manager of the presidential task force on COVID-19, Mukhtar Muhammad, had last Monday announced that the government would release a new travel protocol to prevent the Omicron COVID-19 variant from entering Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) later announced on Wednesday that three cases of Omicron had been detected in the country.\n\nIn the new Nigerian travel protocol dated December 1 and signed by Boss Mustapha, Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, all in-bound passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure and post-arrival day two COVID-19 PCR test.\n\nAlso, all unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals are to observe self-isolation for seven days.\n\nIn addition, there will be day seven post-arrival exit PCR test for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals.\n\nAll out-bound passengers are also required to provide either a valid evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 or negative PCR test result within 48 hours from the time of boarding.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said the revised protocol \u201cis aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\u201d\n\nThe SGF added: \u201cThe review of the protocol is based on science, national experience, and global developments. The PSC assures Nigerians, that it shall continue to monitor global and specific country situations with a view to taking necessary measures to safeguard the health of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PSC calls on all Nigerians to ensure that they have taken their full dose of COVID-19 vaccinations and to continue to observe compliance to public health social measures.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation said Omicron had been detected in at least 23 countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong.\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK, US and Germany have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from Southern Africa.\n\nLast Sunday, the Indonesian government said it would ban travellers from eight African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nFG Approves Booster Dose\n\nThe federal government has formally endorsed the administration of booster dose of the COVID19 vaccine for Nigerians.\n\nA statement by the Head, Public Relations Unit of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Mohammad Ohitoto, said: \u201cThe Presidential Steering Committee, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency has approved the administration of booster doses for persons that have completed two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or 1 dose of Johnson and Johnson.\u201d\n\nHe said that there must be time interval of six months or more after receiving the second dose of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech.\n\nHe also said that the time interval of two months or more after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine should be observed before taking the booster dose.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the above, eligible Nigerians are advised to visit the nearest health facility or mass vaccination site for their booster doses as from the 10th of December, 2021 across all states of the federation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the DG, NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaib, a COVID-19 booster dose gives greater protection against the virus and urged all Nigerians to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the federal government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BREAKING: Secret Police, DSS Invite Ex-Kogi Commissioner Over Comment On Sheikh Gumi's Visit To Okunland",
          "text": "A former commissioner for education in Kogi State, Oluwayomi David Atte, has revealed that the Department of State Services (DSS) invited him over his recent comment on the visit of\n\nIslamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, to Okun land.\n\nAccording to him, the secret police asked him to show up at its office in Lokoja, the state capital, on Tuesday.\n\nAtte said his decision to inform the public about the invitation was to keep people abreast of happenings, given the DSS's record of hounding those with views that oppose the President Muhammadu-led administration.\n\nButtressing his point, the ex-commissioner recalled the experience of Obadiah Mailafia, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who died not long after his encounter with the DSS.\n\nAtte wondered why the DSS did not invite Gumi, who has been holding meetings with armed bandits and foreign Fulanis in various states across the country.\n\nThe former commissioner said the secret police and other security agencies ought to have dissipated similar energy they are using to invite him to deal with issues raised and tackle the insecurity in Okun land.\n\nAtte recounted that in the past few years, Fulani people from foreign countries have taken over several communities in the state, killing people and displacing several others.\n\nThe former commissioner said his comment on Gumi's visit to meet with foreign Fulani in the state was based on grapevine sources.\n\nHe said: \"I have been invited to the DSS State office in Lokoja slated for Tuesday, 7th December 2021 at 10 am\n\n\"The DSS has not formally accused or charged me for anything. The issue of my statements about Gumi's visit to Okunland and our insistence that we need to rise and defend ourselves came from the grapevine.\n\n\"I made the decision to inform Okun people and relevant stakeholders of the invitation by the DSS as a precautionary measure. The nation is not as it used to be, and organs of government in Nigeria tend to show more loyalty to regimes than to the Constitution and the People.\n\n\"They have shown over and over that the survival of a regime is paramount to them, hence, the lives and welfare of citizens of Nigeria have become secondary. So anybody, perceived to even just think differently from the powers they serve, can be wasted or destroyed in the line of duty of security forces. Fresh in my memory is the hounding of my personal friend, the late Obadiah Mailafia, by security agents, soon after which he died.\n\n\"Could this happen to me? Possibly, but not necessarily. With Nigeria's security agencies, one can no longer be sure.\n\nSo I decided to let stakeholders know, just to be aware that they asked me to come.\n\n\"Since I have not been charged or accused, please let us keep calm and hear what they say. It has to concern what Okun People say about their safety and welfare, which I echo.\n\n\"Okun People have lived peacefully with Fulanis for generations. In the last six years, an influx of foreign Fulani into Okunland has taken place with disastrous consequences for our People. We watched with bated breath as they swept through Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, Benue, Kaduna, leaving behind a trail of bloodshed, massacres, destruction of farms, properties and communities. It is in public view that no concerted effort to stop them was made by the government.\n\n\"Then they came into Kogi and Southern Nigeria causing unprecedented insecurity. In Okun land, many areas have been occupied illegally by foreign Fulani, (foreign to us and Nigeria. We encountered them in Okun land and they confessed to coming from Mali in one instance). They have settled on our land, without our permission. From there they kill our people, machete them on their farms, destroy their crops, kidnap them and make us pay a ransom.\n\n\"Our land is unsafe to move about. Chief Osadumo is dead, kidnapped from a church. Hon. Serebe was shot dead by Fulanis on the farm, a vigilante officer was shot and killed near Okedayo. Our Commissioner Omofaiye was shot and Fulanis kidnapped people in Ikoyi last week. The last three regained freedom three days ago after ransom was paid for them.\n\n\"Last Thursday, Elder Ologun was shot dead in Mopa. Widows and farmers have been driven from the farms in Okun land by Fulanis. These are just a few samples. Our very peaceful life in Okun land has been disrupted. On top of all these, Sheikh Gumi came on a solidarity visit to the Fulani people in Okun land who are illegal occupiers of our land. He did not visit our key traditional rulers. Who can do that in the North? It was a slap on our face and a declaration that they can do what they want on our land.\n\n\"Now the numerous statements of Gumi about bandits, his clear sentiments of support for bandits, visiting them in their secret camps and taking photographs with them, heavily armed, are all in the public domain for Nigerians to see. And the government gives him free rein. Which community in Nigeria hears that Gumi is coming to visit Fulani (or bandits?) in their area that will not be alarmed?\"\n\nThe former commissioner said if opportuned during his visit to the DSS office, he would ask probing questions about his invitation and the secret police's seeming support of Gumi.\n\nHe added: \"Which is of more concern to them, the suffering, killing, kidnapping and destruction of Okun people's means of livelihood or their discomfort that we complained of being unprotected by the government we elected?\n\n\"Is the protection of Gumi's image more important to the government than the safety of Okun People?\n\n\"In all the deaths, injuries, kidnappings, etc. inflicted on Okun People in the last 6 years, where were the Police and DSS to help rescue and defend our People?\n\n\"Will the security agencies in the State and each local government area say they do not know where the killer and kidnapping Fulanis are? Have they sought information from the communities and have they acted on such information to thwart killings, kidnappings or even rescued the kidnapped in Okun land?\n\nAnswers to these questions will shed light on the priorities of our security agencies who are charged with protecting us.\"",

          "text": "A former commissioner for education in Kogi State, Oluwayomi David Atte, has revealed that the Department of State Services (DSS) invited him over his recent comment on the visit of\n\nIslamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, to Okun land.\n\nAccording to him, the secret police asked him to show up at its office in Lokoja, the state capital, on Tuesday.\n\nAtte said his decision to inform the public about the invitation was to keep people abreast of happenings, given the DSS's record of hounding those with views that oppose the President Muhammadu-led administration.\n\nButtressing his point, the ex-commissioner recalled the experience of Obadiah Mailafia, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who died not long after his encounter with the DSS.\n\nAtte wondered why the DSS did not invite Gumi, who has been holding meetings with armed bandits and foreign Fulanis in various states across the country.\n\nThe former commissioner said the secret police and other security agencies ought to have dissipated similar energy they are using to invite him to deal with issues raised and tackle the insecurity in Okun land.\n\nAtte recounted that in the past few years, Fulani people from foreign countries have taken over several communities in the state, killing people and displacing several others.\n\nThe former commissioner said his comment on Gumi's visit to meet with foreign Fulani in the state was based on grapevine sources.\n\nHe said: \"I have been invited to the DSS State office in Lokoja slated for Tuesday, 7th December 2021 at 10 am\n\n\"The DSS has not formally accused or charged me for anything. The issue of my statements about Gumi's visit to Okunland and our insistence that we need to rise and defend ourselves came from the grapevine.\n\n\"I made the decision to inform Okun people and relevant stakeholders of the invitation by the DSS as a precautionary measure. The nation is not as it used to be, and organs of government in Nigeria tend to show more loyalty to regimes than to the Constitution and the People.\n\n\"They have shown over and over that the survival of a regime is paramount to them, hence, the lives and welfare of citizens of Nigeria have become secondary. So anybody, perceived to even just think differently from the powers they serve, can be wasted or destroyed in the line of duty of security forces. Fresh in my memory is the hounding of my personal friend, the late Obadiah Mailafia, by security agents, soon after which he died.\n\n\"Could this happen to me? Possibly, but not necessarily. With Nigeria's security agencies, one can no longer be sure.\n\nSo I decided to let stakeholders know, just to be aware that they asked me to come.\n\n\"Since I have not been charged or accused, please let us keep calm and hear what they say. It has to concern what Okun People say about their safety and welfare, which I echo.\n\n\"Okun People have lived peacefully with Fulanis for generations. In the last six years, an influx of foreign Fulani into Okunland has taken place with disastrous consequences for our People. We watched with bated breath as they swept through Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, Benue, Kaduna, leaving behind a trail of bloodshed, massacres, destruction of farms, properties and communities. It is in public view that no concerted effort to stop them was made by the government.\n\n\"Then they came into Kogi and Southern Nigeria causing unprecedented insecurity. In Okun land, many areas have been occupied illegally by foreign Fulani, (foreign to us and Nigeria. We encountered them in Okun land and they confessed to coming from Mali in one instance). They have settled on our land, without our permission. From there they kill our people, machete them on their farms, destroy their crops, kidnap them and make us pay a ransom.\n\n\"Our land is unsafe to move about. Chief Osadumo is dead, kidnapped from a church. Hon. Serebe was shot dead by Fulanis on the farm, a vigilante officer was shot and killed near Okedayo. Our Commissioner Omofaiye was shot and Fulanis kidnapped people in Ikoyi last week. The last three regained freedom three days ago after ransom was paid for them.\n\n\"Last Thursday, Elder Ologun was shot dead in Mopa. Widows and farmers have been driven from the farms in Okun land by Fulanis. These are just a few samples. Our very peaceful life in Okun land has been disrupted. On top of all these, Sheikh Gumi came on a solidarity visit to the Fulani people in Okun land who are illegal occupiers of our land. He did not visit our key traditional rulers. Who can do that in the North? It was a slap on our face and a declaration that they can do what they want on our land.\n\n\"Now the numerous statements of Gumi about bandits, his clear sentiments of support for bandits, visiting them in their secret camps and taking photographs with them, heavily armed, are all in the public domain for Nigerians to see. And the government gives him free rein. Which community in Nigeria hears that Gumi is coming to visit Fulani (or bandits?) in their area that will not be alarmed?\"\n\nThe former commissioner said if opportuned during his visit to the DSS office, he would ask probing questions about his invitation and the secret police's seeming support of Gumi.\n\nHe added: \"Which is of more concern to them, the suffering, killing, kidnapping and destruction of Okun people's means of livelihood or their discomfort that we complained of being unprotected by the government we elected?\n\n\"Is the protection of Gumi's image more important to the government than the safety of Okun People?\n\n\"In all the deaths, injuries, kidnappings, etc. inflicted on Okun People in the last 6 years, where were the Police and DSS to help rescue and defend our People?\n\n\"Will the security agencies in the State and each local government area say they do not know where the killer and kidnapping Fulanis are? Have they sought information from the communities and have they acted on such information to thwart killings, kidnappings or even rescued the kidnapped in Okun land?\n\nAnswers to these questions will shed light on the priorities of our security agencies who are charged with protecting us.\"",

          "text": "A Nigerian man, Osagie Aigbonohan, was on Friday convicted by the Southwark Crown Court, United Kingdom over his involvement in a romance scam in which he conned several women out of thousands of pounds.\n\nThis was made known in a statement issued on Saturday by the National Crime Agency.\n\nThe 40-year-old Nigerian was said to have used a number of aliases to contact women online through dating and social media sites, and in one case cheated a woman out of nearly \u00a310,000 (about N7.5million at the parallel market).\n\nAccording to the statement, Aigbonohan used the name \u2018Tony Eden\u2019, after which he struck up a ten-month relationship with the victim in 2020, via a dating site and persuaded her to lend him money to buy machinery for his business overseas.\n\nThe victim reportedly made nine transfers into various accounts operated by the Nigerian under fake identities, with the money eventually being sent into a personal account held by Aigbonohan, which he used for everyday spending.\n\nAlso, data recovered from Aigbonohan\u2019s phone showed that he received money from at least eight other victims and had been in contact with over 670 people in total.\n\nThe statement said one of the victims was terminally ill, but Aigbonohan continued to pursue her even after she had passed away.\n\nHe was arrested in July 2021 and a false driver\u2019s license was found on him at the time. Also it was discovered that he had no legal right to be in the UK, having overstayed his visa from two years ago.\n\nRecords showed that despite living in Abbey Wood, London, the Nigerian will spend victim\u2019s money in locations across London, Manchester and Glasgow.\n\nNCA officer\u2019s conducted a search on the culprit's residence where they found a footwear he had purchased with store vouchers that could be linked back to one of the victims.\n\nAigbonohan was said to have appeared before Southwark Crown Court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to charges relating to fraud and money laundering.\n\nHe will remain in custody until he is sentenced at the same court on 14 January 2022.\n\nDominic Mugan, NCA Operations Manager, said: \u201cRomance fraud is a particularly cruel crime that impacts victims both emotionally and financially, with victims often feeling like they\u2019re the ones to blame.\n\n\u201cAigbonohan showed total disregard for the victims in this case and was happy to commit further fraud by moving money between various fraudulently held accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that he contacted more people than we know about, if you think you may have been a victim, or may be a victim in a similar case, we would urge you to report the details to Action Fraud.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving with disabilities means several things to different people. Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The Herconomy story: Instagram page to fintech raising $600k in 24 hours",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology? Did Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s story inspire you? Then, we\u2019d love to hear your story. Kindly reach out to me (emmanuel@techpoint.africa) or my colleague, Oluwanifemi (oluwanifemi@techpoint.africa).

Oui Capital and other angel investors also participated in the round.\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work: Interestingly, Herconomy closed the funding round in just 24 hours. A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics.\n\nAn awareness campaign that the stigma attached to people living with AIDS can be just as deadly as the disease.\n\nIn a press statement by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the world \u201ccould face 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next ten years\u201d if inequalities are not addressed.\n\nToday\u2019s insight on AIDS is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here.\n\nOctamile raises $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctamile Founder, Gbenro Dara\n\nOctamile, an African insurtech startup, has closed a $500,000 pre-seed round to simplify access to insurance for Africans.\n\nThe funding round was led by EchoVC. Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team.

Joubert told TechCrunch that over 1,000 companies and 100,000 developers from South Africa, the Netherlands and some parts of Europe use the marketplace.\n\nHowever, its expansion to the Netherlands has been a big part of its growth in 2021, recording a 29% increase in placements.\n\nThis is perhaps why the funding will be used to deepen its expansion into Europe.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nMilitants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt\u2019s Deadliest Terrorist Attack.

          "text": "Nigerians have been advised to get involved in the electoral process in 2023 and not to adopt the past lackadaisical attitude that has not helped the country.\n\nA number of politicians, analysts, groups and observers who spoke to our reporters and correspondents said that the next round of general election was critical to the survival of Nigeria as a country.\n\nFor some years now, it is usual to see many Nigerians fold their arms, saying it does not concern them whosoever wins a general election.\n\nOn the election day, many Nigerians prefer to sit in their cozy parlors watching the proceeding on the their television screens and making all manner of analyses.\n\nBut those who spoke with BusinessDay said if Nigeria must move forward, every hand must be on deck.\n\nIn a subtle sensitisation campaign recently, a concerned Nigerian posted on the social media a challenge to the educated members of the society who, despite their exposure have refused to take part in the electoral process.\n\nThe individual said: \u201cThe Almajiri has a PVC; Mai shayi has a PVC; Mai barrow has a PVC; Mai Debino has a PVC; Mai Gworo has a PVC; Gateman has a PVC; Onion & Tomato sellers have PVCs; Shoe shiner has a PVC; Sugar cane seller has a PVC; Bus Drivers/Conductors have PVC, and Motor park Agberos have PVC, but you (a student or a graduate with BSc or MSC holder) with all your education and exposure still don\u2019t have PVC.\n\nThe worst thing is that you even try to justify why you don\u2019t have one \u2018my vote won\u2019t count.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor the sake of those who paid your school fees and fed you through school, please don\u2019t make all your education/exposure useless with statements like that. If votes don\u2019t count, politicians won\u2019t bribe/pay people to vote them.Go and get your PVC!\u201d\n\nEnough-is-Enough (EiE) Nigeria, a non-for-profit organisation, in a recent release contained in its Newsletter, urged all Nigerians to arm themselves with their permanent voters\u2019 cards (PVCs), urging those yet to get theirs to make all necessary effort to do so.\n\nEiE Nigeria said: \u201cWe recorded a 22.13percent increase in Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in 2019. 2023 is now up to us! Remember that the final lap towards carrying out your civic duty as an electorate starts from getting your PVC so you can vote on election day.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Abuja, Ibrahim Shekarau said that the political future of Nigeria depended on the interest of the citizens.\n\nIn an interview with BusinessDay recently, the former governor of Kano State said: \u201cToday, people still don\u2019t have trust in government. And some of us in the political arena only see the people around in the name of party members. If you add all the 18 registered parties and all their members carrying their cards, they constitute a very insignificant percentage of Nigerians. So, why are we thinking only of patronage of party people? We must restore the confidence of the people. And this failure of confidence has led us to electing people that are not representative enough; all of us.\u201d\n\nThe serving senator and former Education minister, further said: \u201cOn INEC record, we have over 82million registered voters. But from 1989 to date, at no time have we had up to 40 million people voting. We end up electing a president with 15 million people. There is therefore, that apathy to election. When we are doing the voter registration, the religious leaders, the traditional leaders will mobilise voters, some will even say unless you show your voters card you won\u2019t go into the church; you won\u2019t go into the hospital; etc., all in an effort to mobilise people to get registered.\n\n\u201cBut what are we doing to encourage people to come out and vote? This is a challenge to the political parties, political leaders, to the electoral commission, civil societies, it\u2019s a challenge to the media. Let everybody pose and ask this question; where are 50 million people when the election comes? Only 30 or 35 million people will vote and yet it is real in a register of 80 million. It is real it is not fake. So, then what are we doing to bring out these people? And if all of these millions will come out, you\u2019ll discover that no elected government will take people for granted.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cRegarding thuggery and electoral malpractices, if in a polling unit you have 500 registered voters and all of them come to vote, no thug will dare come there to snatch a box. But when they realise that only some few people will come out, maybe 10, 20 or 30 to vote, this gives the polling clerk the opportunity to do some fraud. This gives the opportunity to the thugs to come and snatch the ballot box. So, one of the steps is not a creation of the tribunal for election offenders. The question is what do you do to even stop the offence? It is more important. If I say we are getting election malpractice because we are not prosecuting people, yes that is true but what are we doing to even stop those who attempt to do fraud? If a large number come out, then you find that nobody will dare engage in malpractice. For instance, 400 people come out, no young man will think of coming to foment trouble.\u201d\n\nRead Also: 2023 elections: Nigeria back to pre-1999 era\n\nNo democracy without voters\n\nOf all the various definitions of democracy globally, the most universally famous is the one that refers to it as the \u201cgovernment of the people by the people and for the people.\u201d\n\nSo, the meaning of the definition is that, it is the people that give impetus to democracy, and without people\u2019s participation such a system cannot be referred to as democracy.\n\nIn such a system, it is the people that determine, through their votes, who occupies public office. But in Nigeria in recent decades, the reverse has been the case; voter turnout for election has increasingly become abysmally low.\n\nAccording to the record from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the situation appears to have worsened in recent elections and has undermined the credibility of the election and the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\nIn Nigeria, voter apathy is a national trend that is perhaps, more worrisome in Southern Nigeria, irrespective of whether the election is a local or national election.\n\nFor instance, the recently concluded council election in Lagos State vividly captures the danger the trend poses to democratic processes in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, only 18percent of the total voters registered actually voted during the election. A Similar situation had existed in 2017 LG polls, which was also marred by voter apathy, with only 17 percent of the total registered voters voting.\n\nAlso, for the first time in history since the return to democracy in 1999, Nigeria recorded the lowest rate of voter turnout of 34.75 percent at the last presidential election held in 2019.\n\nThat figure of voter turnout in the 2019 election in Nigeria is said to be the lowest of all recent elections held on the African continent, according to the data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (I-IDEA).\n\nSimilar situation happened in the federal legislative by-election that was held in March this year in Aba North/Aba South federal constituency of Abia State, in which the election witnessed only 3percent turnout; it meant that only about 3 in 100 registered voters showed up to vote at that particular election.\n\nObservers say that the growing trend has serious implications on the prospect of deepening democracy in the country. In essence, it ensures that leaders who attain political power via the votes of the minority rule over the majority.\n\nAlthough stakeholders have deduced several reasons for the trend, however, pundits say that part of the reasons is the increasing loss of confidence of the Nigerian voters in the electoral process and the political elite running the affairs of the state because of decades of bad leadership.\n\nThey are of the view that this also indirectly affects voter behaviour which leads to voter apathy.\n\n\u201cThe current ruling elite have not really done much in changing the narrative because voters\u2019 confidence has continually gone down the drain since the government has failed to yield to its campaign promises.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that this may further affect voters\u2019 behaviour in future elections if the government or ruling elite do not rebuild public confidence in them and the electoral process,\u201d Kunle Okunade, political analyst said.\n\nOkunade added that the situation could likely change if elected public office holders become more responsive, fulfilling their campaign promises to the electorates, while stakeholders should embark on massive voter education.\n\n\u201cThey can do this through following the dictate of the Electoral Act to the letter and change in the leadership behaviour. The ruling elite need to change their leadership toga from public fund exploiters to public goods providers.\n\n\u201cWith this, voters would have belief and trust in the political elite and thereby change their political behaviour from apathy to participatory. INEC should also carry out voter education across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nTunde Daramola, a former national Secretary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, said years of bad governance and leadership failure was a major reason for voter apathy in Nigeria, adding that Nigerians had lost confidence in the electoral system.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPeople are not happy with the way things are done here; I mean Nigerians are hungry and you want them to vote. Governments have failed at all levels, the apathy is because of the belief that their votes would not count.\n\n\u201cPeople are refusing to vote because they are not happy with the system, so there must be a holistic change in the way we do things.\u201d\n\nHowever, political analyst, Kehinde kayode, said the problem is caused by several factors in the country that must be tackled for the trend to change.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cVoter apathy in Nigeria is tied to three important factors which include an increased uneducated population; second, a huge disconnect of the peoples\u2019 trust in the electoral process and government, and third, common scenario of electoral violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf all of the above factors are not addressed and reduced to the barest minimum possible, the case of voter apathy will forever linger on in Nigeria and continue to endanger our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe question we necessarily need to ask is to what extent we have as a country addressed these issues when we are putting out programmes or projects to address apathy?\u201d\n\nThe analyst also pointed out that \u201cWe must know that a solution to one of the factors causing voter apathy is dependent on the other. For Instance, even when we have an increase in the number of people who are educated, do we have a corresponding increase in ensuring the safety of voters during elections? And to what extent has the government- people trust improved with electoral result transparency?\u201d\n\nLike in 1993, free, fair poll still possible\n\nMany observers of Nigerian politics will easily agree that the June 12, 1993 general election was very successful and unarguably, the freest election in the history of Nigerian democracy.\n\nWell, credit goes to the electorate for the massive turnout, which even the international observers commended and acclaimed to be the highest in any election in Africa then.\n\nThe massive turnout was probably because Nigerians were tired of the long years of military rule and were out to unseat the junta through their votes.\n\nSadly today, subsequent elections have been having very poor turnout across the country, especially in the Southern part of the country.\n\nThe voter apathy is even alarming in the last two general elections won by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBut most political observers blame the apathy on the unfulfilled campaign promises of the politicians, hence, making voters doubt whatever is promised and even refusing to vote again.\n\n\u201cOur votes do not count,\u201d many aggrieved voters always lament.\n\nRecall that APC, the ruling party, which used \u2018Change\u2019 as its campaign slogan in 2015 when it was in opposition, asked Nigerians to vote for them as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the then ruling party, according to APC, has failed to fulfil its campaign promises.\n\nToday, many, even party members are more aggrieved as their party hardly fulfil the smallest campaign promise, observers noted.\n\nDecrying the growing lack of interest among voters, Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, said it is the expression of anger by the voters, who have discovered that their votes do not count, though it is the worst way to go about it.\n\n\u201cThough I am now based in Belgium, I still follow our politics. My father and many other aggrieved voters did not vote in the last general election because the candidates everybody wanted for the Senate and House of Representatives were rigged out during the primaries. For him, their votes will not count as the machinery that rigged the primaries will also rig the main election in the favour of the candidates who many distaste for their arrogance, ill-gotten wealth and intimidation of locals,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he regretted that such actions only made them disenfranchise themselves, giving the politicians opportunity to rig.\n\nAs bad as voter apathy is, Chijoke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, said that it is a reflection of realities for the voters, who always see their efforts on Election Day being fruitless with questionable election results.\n\nSpeaking from experience, the former Abia lawmaker said he has several witnessed imposition of candidates at ninth hour, resulting in the people sitting back, yet huge results were announced in such areas and the people wonder if spirits were the ones that voted as they did not come out.\n\n\u201cIn one of the elections in Ihechiowa in Arochukwu, a party bigwig and moneybag told the people that whether they vote or not that their party candidate is going to win the House of Representative. The people did not vote and the candidate won without votes\u201d, he said, lamenting that such situations make voters sit on the fence.\n\nBut sitting on the fence comes with a huge cost.\n\nThe lawyer-turned politician decried that voter apathy is the bane of poor governance as the informed voters sit at home and allow touts and those bought with mere N1000 to decide their collective future.\n\nGoing practical, Umelahi explained the risk of voter apathy saying, if three candidates are contesting for an electoral position and one is favoured by the people but does not have money, the people should support him at all cost to win because if the others use touts to get to power, they will continue with their touts, intimidation and no development.\n\nMaking reference with the advice given to Rivers youths by Chibuike Amaechi, minister of transportation, during one of the presidential campaigns in Rivers State, Magnus Okpeti, a Political Science lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, said that the former governor charged the youths to go for power as politicians will not relinquish power to them without fierce challenge.\n\nConsidering that advice, the aggrieved Ogoni-born Okpete said sitting at home on Election Day is giving up on oneself and change cannot come by doing the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe need to go beyond coming out in mass to vote, to defending our votes and sacking our tormentors. But voter apathy will not guarantee any change in voters\u2019 favour,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that many blame the growing voter apathy on rigging and especially intimidation by security operatives before and on the Election Day, but that such are expected and voters should know better and counter such intimidation with mass turnout.\n\n\u201cWe all saw what happened at the Anambra election recently. Before the election, there were killings, insecurity everywhere and fear that the people would not come out to vote, but some stakeholders went underground to tell the people that the only way to fight the enemies of the state and gain their common interest is to come out and vote. Things changed dramatically. People understood the game plan and countered it,\u201d Okpeti said.\n\nIn the same vein, Umelahi insisted that votes will count if people are determined to change the situation.\n\n\u201cThere is an extent you can rig or intimidate the people. With what is happening, the ruling party cannot win an election in the East and South South. So, the only option is rigging and intimidation, which the people are resisting fiercely now. If we say no to their policies or candidates, the ruling party and its government cannot kill all of us because this is democracy, it is only fear that is making people chicken out,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nFor Onikoyi, there is no need to fear again because the voters have not benefited from the dividends of democracy and if this gets into the consciousness of the voters, they will resist intimidations and turnout in mass to vote out the bad eggs.\n\nMaking emphasis on the need to turnout in mass to cast their votes, Onikoyi warned voters, saying, \u201cDo not fear that your votes will not count, vote first and defend your votes. June 12, 1993 general election is being lauded today because the voters are still insisting that their votes must count even after over two decades of its annulment.\u201d\n\nMy worries with Nigeria\u2019s brand of electorate \u2013 Sonaiya\n\nOluremi Sonaiya, a professor, panellist at AELEX law firm\u2019s webinar session titled \u2018The Nigeria We Want, Economic, Political, and Social Justice\u2019 on Wednesday, December 1, 2021, said: \u201cWe all know that \u2018stomach infrastructure\u2019 matters a lot, and people sell and purchase votes; you\u2019ll also hear things like, you know this guy is from my neighbourhood, or you know this person shares my religion during elections.\u201d\n\nNigerians may also choose a candidate based on the size of the party. The fact that the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) received the larger chunk of votes in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections resulted in the conclusion that voting for candidates from other parties may be a waste of time or may have little or no impact.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we are not making well-informed choices,\u201d Sonaiya admitted, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though we\u2019re the ones who put our necks in the loops and demand that they be tightened. Nigerians persuade themselves that they do not want to squander their votes by voting for someone who is unlikely to win.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that about 10 percent of the population is responsible for electing those who are in power. \u201cThat leaves us with 90 people to work with; imagine if they all resolved to do things differently; things would start to shift,\u201d she said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s first female presidential contender further said: \u201cI believe it is past time for us to genuinely begin to be analytical, to scrutinise people, and to begin to be rational in our election choices. Why do we keep voting for people who have clear records of either fraud or even a criminal past, and so on, when we know so much about them and their character? Are those the ideals we want to see in those who will lead us? As a result, these are critical challenges for us. We must be unbiased when it comes to ethnicity, religion, and other factors. We need people with character, we need people with competence, and those should begin to be the prerequisites that we consider before we make our choices.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has urged international donors to support the government in executing sustainable agricultural programmes to check food security.\n\nThe governor made the call during a courtesy visit by the Joint Mission of the Federal Government of Nigeria, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) led by the IFAD Country Programme Manager, Dr. Patrick Habamenshiin, at the Government House in Benin City.\n\nWhile commending IFAD on its impactful role across Africa, Obaseki said the assistance provided by the Fund can help leapfrog systems and institutions in Nigeria and Edo State.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe have failed to create the real market for agricultural produce, economic culture, subsidizing agricultural produce and mixed pricing of exchange rate. These are some of the fundamental macro economic issues, which is not taking us anywhere. Agricultural business is a serious business in the country. Some of the macro economic situations are changing.\n\n\u201cAs a government, our focus is how to be serious and help address the challenges. 50 to 60 years ago, our communities, society, and the economy were driven by agriculture. Commodity boards, farm institutions were well-organized, and people had a culture, but not anymore.\u201d\n\nObaseki said, \u201cAs a governor for five years, I have not really seen the impact as I try to measure the impact by asking what has really changed? Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) Office carry a lot of signboards with all sorts of assisted programmes but yet no much impact or difference has been made in agricultural production and output. This is the major challenge, amongst other problems.\n\n\u201cSome assistance you are providing is to help us re-enact agriculture again because that is the only thing that can sustain us. Maybe the young ones don\u2019t want to go into agriculture but technology has made things easy. Working together, we would like to deal with serious issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you will not solve all our problems for us but help and assist us to accelerate our development and look at specific areas and be clear on the expectations and deliverables.\n\n\u201cSome of our institutions are so weak. That is why you can\u2019t implement some of the programmes. We should look at how to strengthen some of these institutions to take advantage of what you are bringing to the table,\u201d he added.\n\nThe IFAD Country Programme Manager in Nigeria, Dr. Patrick Habamenshi said the delegation are in Edo State to carry out an implementation support mission, focusing on the state as it has one of the most dynamic programmes in Nigeria.\n\nHe commended Governor Obaseki for the counterpart funding he made to the programme which contributed to the success of the programme, noting, \u201cWe understand that the programme needs to get aligned with the strategy of the state government and we can\u2019t implement a programme in the state that is disconnected from what the state government is trying to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe would work with your team to see how to remodel and make the programme have its developmental objectives aligned to yours.\u201d\n\n...",

As we continue to watch this case closely, we extend our prayers and support to the Oromoni family.\n\n\u201cAs they mourn the loss of their young son, I pray that Almighty God gives them the strength that they need at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the umbrella body of Ijaw Youths worldwide, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) has joined in demanding for justice for the Ikaw born student.\n\nIn a statement signed by Comr. Ebilade Ekerefe National Spokesman, Ijaw Youth Council and made available to newsmen in Warri, the group said,\n\n\u201cWe watched with awe and shock the reported circumstances surrounding the death of a 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe have read to our chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe supposed injuries from the beatings led to his death, according to a Twitter user with the handle\n\n@perrisonoromoni, the boy\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the school\u2019s statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u201cLate Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbeh-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil. We are thankful to them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the\n\nschool management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by\n\ntrying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the Ijaw Youths worldwide wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester\n\nOromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe also call for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death. They have shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder. The fake story about the hip injury from a game of football shows in clear language that they are complicit in the crime!\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating license of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity showed by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commiserate with Sylvester Oromini Snr and the entire Ogbeh-Ijoh Royal family on this royal blood that has been spilled in a most dastardly manner.\n\n...",

          "title": "Dowen College Killing: Cultism, drug addiction wreck schools",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nCultism, with its attendant violence and brutal deaths, has been a sad feature of of Nigeria\u2019s school system since 1952 when a group of university students in Ibadan, notable of among whom is Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, decided to form a campus confraternity, National Association of Sea Dogs, a group that would later be known widely as Pirates Confraternity.\n\nThe initial objectives were perhaps noble; just a group boys who wanted to feel different; to distinguish themselves from the crowd. But as the days passed, school confraternity evolved into violent drug gangs intimidating, harassing and murdering fellow students on campus.\n\nStill, while cult violence reaped through Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions, primary and secondary schools, and indeed neighbourhoods were somewhat immune from it. Not anymore. Gradually, it permeated, and today it\u2019s become an epidemic, one, once again highlighted by killing last week, of 12-year-old Sylvester Oromoni, allegedly by fellow students at Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos State.\n\nOromoni, named after his father, so was called Junior, was the last of 10 children and his only offence, it\u2019s said, was his refusal to join a cult group at the college. His fellow students, five in number, were alleged to have bullied him severally until they eventually beat him so bad that he died of his injuries, before the very eyes of his parents who had spent a fortune to send him to an elite school with a view to grooming him to be the best he could be.\n\nToday, he lies stone dead, in a hospital mortuary while his alleged killers, teens like himself, are on the run, with some said to have been flown abroad already.\n\nIn trending hospital footage, the unclad Oromoni Junior was seen writhing in pain, legs and belly swollen, and mouth swollen, red from severe injury, and bleeding, while he struggled until he breathed his last. But before then, he had confessed that contrary to initial account that he sustained injuries while playing football, he was actually beaten by the fellow students for refusing to join their cult, and that the same boys had threatened to even visit him with more harm if he told anyone.\n\nAt his side, while he cried in pain was his mother who wept and cursed those who mutilated her son\u2019s body. \u201cIt shall not be well with them who did this to my son,\u201d she said. \u201cFor them to hit my son like this, it shall not be well with them. The God I serve will not forgive them.\u201d\n\nThe school, weary of the negative publicity the tragic incident could attract, allegedly tried to hide the truth. Indeed, the Nigerian populace only became aware because Perry Oromoni, the diseased boy\u2019s nephew, took to social media to share his account of what transpired, explaining that the young Oromoni was attacked for vehemently declining to join what he termed the secondary school\u2019s \u201ccult group\u201d dominated by older boys at the institution.\n\nBut dismissing the dying boy\u2019s account of what happened to him, Dowen College in a statement said one of it\u2019s hostel officials had informed the management on November 21 that Junior was injured while playing football with his colleagues. The school also claimed that he was given first aid by a resident nurse and returned to his hostel after he expressed relief. It said Junior started complaining of pain in his hip the next day.\n\n\u201cPreliminary investigation showed that there was no fighting, bullying, or any form of attack on the boy. He made no such reports, neither to his sister who is also a student, nor any other students, prefects, house parents, medical staff, or any of the management staff. The school has 2 regular nurses and a qualified medical doctor that promptly attends to students. [We] will not tolerate any acts of cultism which is why there is nothing like that,\u201d the school had said.\n\nThe family, however, insisted that their son\u2019s account on his dying bed was indeed, what happened to him. And indeed, many agree that the nature of the boy\u2019s injury is not what can be sustained on the football field.\n\n\u201cMy son suffered. The boys they mentioned were also reported to the school last term when they bullied Junior and collected all his foodstuffs; clothes. I have two daughters, one of whom earlier graduated. I had to remove the second after this incident. They asked this boy to describe the sister\u2019s privates and this got to us,\u201d his father Sylvester Oromoni (Snr), told online medium, The Cable.\n\nHe noted that Dowen College temporarily suspended the boys involved and Junior was also taken to a new hostel, but the bullying and intimidation still continued into the new term.\n\n\u201cThey put fear in him so much so that, when you ask him, he might keep to himself and say, \u2018they will kll me\u2019. I considered removing him but reconsidered since his sisters were still in the school.\n\nMr. Sylvester told the medium that he got to know about the new incident on November 21st, after the school called his wife to inform her that their son was injured and was in the school clinic.\n\nHe added that his son couldn\u2019t stand because his waist was bent and one side of his belly was swollen. His mouth was black and he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\n\nHe also revealed that Junior told his mum that he didn\u2019t play football, neither did he fall. Thus, countering the school\u2019s claim that he got injured while playing football, according to the Cable.\n\n\u201cThey kicked him, matched his waist. Other students ran off. They threatened to kill them all if they spoke a word to the school staff. They warned Junior to say he sustained injuries while playing ball. They threatened him. If you ask the roommate, they\u2019d all lie. They matched his ribs and waist. All that pain for a 12-year-old.\u201d\n\nOromoni said Junior suffered liver enlargement due to congealed blood. It was also claimed that Junior was fed with a chemical-like liquid substance for refusing to join the cult, but regretted that because the parents of his killers were wealthy, they were withdrawn from school.\n\n\u201cThe parents of the boys are wealthy. They withdrew them. Some of the parents are planning to fly the children out of the country. The boys are five in number: four are in SS2 while one is in SS1,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the boys were said to have been flown abroad by their parents who obviously want to escape the consequences of their actions. Among those identified as the errant bullies on social media, which is yet to be confirmed by police, are Michael Kashamu, Angel Temile, Favour Benjamin, Edward Brown and Agboro Emmanuel.\n\nOromoni further said the principal of the college took exception to his decision to release the deceased boy\u2019s picture to the press, while noting that he looks forward to an autopsy, arguing that Dowen should be more concerned about going after the boys Junior had named as his assailants before death.\n\n\u201cThey even released a press statement. Was the principal there when the boy played the said football game? Can they identify who he played with? Where was the housemaster when he was playing it? The woman too is confused. Clearly, she\u2019s trying to protect the school\u2019s image. But a mother of children wants to hide the truth?\u201d he wondered.\n\nOutrage Over Killing\n\nSeveral Nigerians, including celebrities and Amnesty International, have continued to express outrage over the boy\u2019s death, while demanding justice for him using #JusticeForSylvester.\n\n\u201cToday, 4 Dec. 2021, Sylvester Oromoni would have been celebrating his birthday. The Lagos State authorities must investigate the incidents leading to Sylvester\u2019s death and ensure no child goes through what he endured. Schools must be places of safety,\u201d Amnesty International Nigeria tweeted via its handle, @AmnestyNigeria at the weekend.\n\nMusic star and actor, Bankole Wellington, @BankyW, noted on his part, that \u201cSylvester\u2019s death is the most heartbreaking story I\u2019ve heard this year. This is every family\u2019s worst nightmare. No parent should ever have to bury their child. I can\u2019t imagine the intense pain his family feels right now. Justice must be served.\u201d\n\nTo commemorate the boy\u2019s birthday, which would have been on Saturday, and which his parents celebrated even in his absence, actress Tonto Dikeh, delivered flowers to the college.\n\nMany have also called out Dowen for not doing enough to protect students.\n\n\u201cA colleague of mine reported that her daughter was being bullied by a senior, the school said she should endure that the senior will soon graduate, said a Twitter user, @Signora_Larissa. \u201cHer daughter fainted and the school didn\u2019t notify her until her daughter called 3 days later. YES, same DOWEN.\u201d\n\n\u201cI served in Dowen College and the problem mostly is parents don\u2019t want their children scolded by a teacher, teachers don\u2019t want to lose jobs, school don\u2019t want to lose money! Business for schl, jobs for teachers and spoilt brat for parents,\u201d said a another user, @shelleofficial.\n\nPolice Order Investigation as Lagos Orders Closure of College\n\nAmid the outrage and controversy over the boy\u2019s death, Lagos State Government on Friday, ordered the indefinite closure of the college.\n\nThe announcement was contained in a statement issued by the state\u2019s ministry of education on Friday and signed by an assistant director, public affairs unit of the ministry, Ganiu Lawal.\n\nAccording to the statement, the state\u2019s commissioner for education, Folasade Adefisayo, made the announcement \u201cafter a meeting with the School Management and Staff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government has ordered the indefinite closure of Dowen College, Lekki , pending the outcome of an investigation into the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, a student of the school,\u201d the statement said in part. \u201cThe commissioner called for calm, saying no effort will be spared in getting to the root of the incident.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Lagos police command said it has launched an investigation into the death of Oromoni.\n\nSpokesperson for the police in the state, Adekunle Ajisebutu, in a statement disclosed that the case will be handled by Homicide Section of the Lagos State Criminal Investigation Department.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to inform the public that, although no formal report of the incident was made to the police, the Commissioner of Police upon hearing about it instantly directed the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Division, under whose jurisdiction the place of incident is to immediately visit the school to carry out an initial investigation into the incident,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThis directive has been carried out as an investigation into the case has since commenced. However, in view of the seriousness of the case, the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, has also been directed to take over the investigation of the case immediately.\u201d\n\nRising Menace\n\nOromoni\u2019s death, tragic as it is, is not isolated incident, and speaks to rising rate cultism and cult related deaths in Nigerian schools, a phenomenon increasingly occurring in elementary schools.\n\nIn June, 14-year-old Karen-Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher, a student of Premier Academy, Lugbe, Abuja, was allegedly raped in her school by students suspected to be cultists. She died from complications resulting from the rape few on June 22 June.\n\nAn NGO, Exams Ethic Marshall International (EEMI), said recently that no fewer than 10,000 people have been killed in cult-related violence within and outside school campuses between 1996 and 2019.\n\n\u201cDowen is a tip of the iceberg,\u201d said human rights lawyer, Abdul Mahmoud, who blamed the Lagos State government for not setting up structures to check cult activities in schools.\n\n\u201cDowen College death and the response of LASG highlight everything that is wrong with Nigeria. Where\u2019s the Children\u2019s Care Department of the LGA that Dowen is located? Where\u2019s the Schools Inspectorate? An apparent crime has been committed, so where\u2019s the police in all of this?\n\n\u201cA modern country (including the subnational states) should\u2019ve framework for addressing issues arising from schools\u2019 deaths. Lagos, they say, is the Centre of Excellence; but it can\u2019t make dedicated lines available to the public.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, 12 elementary and secondary school pupils of a public school in Lagos were caught being initiated into the AWAWA confraternity group.\n\nBefore then, in May 2017, seven pupils from four public secondary schools in the were arrested and arraigned before an Ebute Meta magistrate court.\n\nStill in September same year, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Ikeja, arraigned 12 pupils of another public Junior Secondary School in Lagos before an Ikeja chief magistrate court, for the scourge. This was followed up still, by the arrest of 17 pupils for cult activities by Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC).\n\nBut it\u2019s not a Lagos only problem. It\u2019s nationwide menace. In October this year, a High Court in Maiduguri, Borno State sentenced 19 students to six years imprisonment each for cultism.\n\nEarlier in March, four suspected cultists of Government Secondary School, Akim, in Calabar Municipal Local Government Area of Cross River State were arrested by police.\n\nFew years ago, the Ministry of Education in Bayelsa State expelled seven pupils found to be cult members, from a community school.\n\nIn 2016, Delta State police apprehended 28 primary and secondary pupils aged between 13 and 16, for cultism.\n\nIn 2014, Police in Ondo arrested four students for cultism. In 2013, 18 children in Abeokuta, Ogun State were arrested for being cult members. In the same year, 11 other students were arrested.\n\nWorried by the evolving trend of cultism in schools, particularly in Lagos, the state police command in 2018, appealed to the state government to declare a state of emergency on cultism in its primary and secondary schools.\n\nIt\u2019s a menace that has eaten deep into the system, even as local communities are afflicted by it.\n\n\u201cJust to give a glimpse: One day, while I seized one of the boys phone in order to get him focused\u2026 I decided to go through his chats\u2026 I came across a a series of chats where he and some other students where talking about how they enjoyed an orgy that one of them organised, narated Tamuno of Lagos, @PragmaticTammy\n\n\u201cReading further down, they also talked about how the school suspended some of their classmates for suspected cultist activity in their boarding school.

          "text": "Zenith Bank\u2019s Group Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, has emerged CEO of the Year for a second consecutive year at the Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility (SERAS) CSR Africa Awards held at the weekend in Lagos. According to the judges, he was selected for a number of reasons, including engendering a culture that promotes the continued investment in social initiatives in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under his leadership, the Zenith Bank\u2019s social investments totalled NGN3.285 billion in 2020, representing nearly 2% of the Bank\u2019s profit after tax.\n\nThe judges found him worthy for his commitment to promoting sustainability and responsible business practices in Nigeria, by his frontal leadership of sustainability in Zenith Bank, thereby enabling best industry practices in the banking sector, and for his passion for reducing carbon emissions in the Bank\u2019s operations.\n\nZenith Bank Plc also emerged winner in four other categories at the SERAS CSR Africa Awards, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa\u201d.\n\nZenith Bank was adjudged the Most Responsible Organisation in Africa, winning the overall best sustainability award, for its continued commitment to the tenets of Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, within its immediate community and in the society at large.\n\nThe Bank also emerged as the winner in the category for Reporting and Transparency for its consistency in disclosing and communicating its sustainability journey and progress annually vis-a-vis environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, in line with the guidelines and protocols set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Nigeria Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP), NigerianExchange (NGX), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The Bank also ensures the assurance of its sustainability report by reputable independent third parties. In 2021, the Bank\u2019s 2020 sustainability report was assured by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and disseminated through the Bank\u2019s website for the public and sent to all relevant stakeholders, including the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\nIn the infrastructure development category, the Bank was voted winner for its nation-building initiatives and investments, including supporting efforts towards establishing basic services and functional security, governance, and economic and infrastructure systems, especially in Nigeria. As a testament to this and in demonstration of its commitment to the development (often referred to as reform, restructuring and rebuilding) of the Nigeria Police Force for the preservation of law and order, protection of life and property, and law enforcement in Nigeria, the Bank supported the Lagos State Security Trust Fund with N500,000,000.00 for the provision of security-enhancing facilities and infrastructure. This is in addition to contributions to other state security trust funds.\n\nZenith Bank was adjudged winner in the category for the Best Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment for its Z-Woman initiative, which offers credit facilities to women-owned businesses at a single-digit interest rate and for a gender-balanced workforce (Women make up about 50% of employees). During the reporting period, the number of women and women enterprises supported by the Bank, through the Z-Woman initiative, grew by 88.7%, from 391 in 2019 to 738 in 2020.\n\nThe Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility Awards (SERAS) is an initiative of TruCSR which celebrates and promotes investments by corporate organisations in the society through CSR and sustainability initiatives. It made its debut in 2007, and participation was opened to other countries of Africa in 2016.\n\nThe 2021 awards featured 387 projects by 97 organisations across Africa. The SERAS Jury Board consists of global thought and best-practices leaders from around the world such as Maria Sillanpaa (Finland); Nyasha Gwatidzo (Zimbabwe); Adesuwa Onyenokwe (Nigeria); Amjed Achour (Morocco); Charles Ojei (Nigeria); Ellen Gunning (Ireland); Gina Din-Kariuki (Kenya); Indira Kartallozi (England); Lampe Omoyele (Nigeria); Paul Kapelus (South Africa); and Scott Walker (England).",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State has said that the Senate chief whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has no plan to leave the party just as it maintained that it would be sucidal for him to attempt defection.\n\nThe party was reacting to reports making the rounds that Kalu, who represents Abia North senatorial district in the Senate, was making moves to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis was contained in a press statement issued by the publicity secretary of the APC in the state, Mr. Okey Ezeala, a copy of which was made available to LEADERSHIP in Umuahia on Sunday.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, the Senator representing Abia North on our party platform is going no where. This is authoritative.\n\n\u201cWhat is playing out is that Kalu and his supporters are finding it very difficult to swallow the humble pie, and accept the fact that they have lost out in the 2021 congresses of our great party.\n\n\u201cTheir expectation that the state party structure will fall into their hands has become a bridge too far. They have refused to display the spirit of sportsmanship and queue behind the winners.\u201d\n\nIt added that Kalu was suffering from excess hubris, sying that what the party wants the general public to know is that he is merely flying a kite, perhaps to attract the attention of its national leaders to beg him not to leave.\n\n\u201cAnd if that eventually works to his plan, his primary objective would be to extract some concessions.

This is authoritative.\n\n\u201cWhat is playing out is that Kalu and his supporters are finding it very difficult to swallow the humble pie, and accept the fact that they have lost out in the 2021 congresses of our great party.\n\n\u201cTheir expectation that the state party structure will fall into their hands has become a bridge too far. They have refused to display the spirit of sportsmanship and queue behind the winners.\u201d\n\nIt added that Kalu was suffering from excess hubris, sying that what the party wants the general public to know is that he is merely flying a kite, perhaps to attract the attention of its national leaders to beg him not to leave.\n\n\u201cAnd if that eventually works to his plan, his primary objective would be to extract some concessions. Unfortunately for him, no winner in the congress is ready to concede his position,\u201d the APC spokesman said.\n\nIt noted that every Abian knows that he lacks the courage to pursue his political ambition outside the party as \u201con the two previous occasions he tried it, he failed woefully until he eventually found refuge in APC.\n\n\u201cFor sure, if for any reason he should leave the party that engendered his political rehabilitation, we can guarantee that he would sink deeper into the doldrums from where he will never rise again.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the statement, the Senator has no political clout of his own and that the party is what sustains him politically.\n\n\u201cWe in Abia APC are calling on our national leadership to call his bluff.\n\n\u201cThe risk of quiting the ruling party is too great for him to take.

          "text": "Senator Ibrahim Shekarau on Sunday joined the growing number of chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, who have visited the former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his Bourdillon Ikoyi Lagos home in the past few weeks.\n\nShekarau, also a former governor of Kano State, reportedly held a closed door meeting with his Lagos host during the visit.\n\nHowever, no statement has been issued on the purpose of the former Kano governor visit to the Lagos chieftain of his party at least as at the time of writing this story.\n\nBut Shekarau\u2019s visit to Tinubu, who has obviously started consultation with prominent individuals and stakeholders across the country on his interest to run for the presidency in 2023 came against the background of his ongoing battle with Abdullahi Ganduje, the incumbent governor of Kano for the control of the state chapter of APC.\n\nThe Kano chapter of APC had been factionalised with one faction tagged G7 led by Shekarau and the other faction led by Ganduje before the recent congresses of the party.\n\nJust like in other APC states, the G7 faction and the Ganduje faction of the party had elected two parallel executives at the congresses of the party, including the 18 October state congress.\n\nWhile the G7 faction elected Haruna Danzago as the chairman of its executive, Abdullahi Abbas was elected to lead the Ganduje faction of the party.\n\nThe G7 faction had consequently petitioned the National Headquarters of APC.\n\nBut the APC National Appeal Committee had recognized Abbas as the authentic chairman of the party in the state.\n\nShekarau challenged the decision in court, asking for the nullification of the congresses at the ward, local government and state levels conducted by the Ganduje faction while his own should be recognized.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on Tuesday, a Federal High Court in Abuja granted the Senator\u2019s request while also restraining the Ganduje faction from appointing a new executive.\n\nMembers of the Ganduje faction had vowed to appeal that judgment while arguing that the Federal High Court in Abuja lacks the jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nKano Commissioner for Information, Mohammed Garba, in a statement, also said the court ruling only affected the ward congress of the party.\n\nBut members of the Shekarau faction have been rejoicing over the court judgment.\n\nAnalysts have also been pontificating on its implication for the 2023 presidential ticket of APC, especially if the judgment was not upturned.\n\nFor one, Kano has played pivotal roles in presidential election in Nigeria because of its huge population.\n\nThe state, with the high number of political appointee and party members will even play a crucial role in determining who emerges the presidential candidate of APC because of the huge voting strength it will bring to the table regardless of whether direct or delegate system is used for selection of its flag bearer.\n\nGanduje and members of his faction of APC are believed to be strong supporters of the presidential ambition of Tinubu.\n\nMembers of Kano House of Assembly who are mostly loyalists of Ganduje had also, at various times, pledged to work for Tinubu presidency.\n\nThe former Lagos governor has also paid several visits to Kano.\n\nAnd for the first time in a decade, the annual Tinubu Colloquium was held in the ancient city this year, a move believed to be arranged by Ganduje to popularise the former Lagos governor\u2019s presidential ambition in the Northern part of the country.\n\nThe expectation was that Ganduje will bring in the strength of Kano APC to support Tinubu when the push comes to shove on the selection of APC presidential candidate.\n\nBut with the court judgment which at least for now, effectively put the control of the structure of Kano APC in the hands of Shekarau, such expectation seemed to be in jeopardy.\n\nIndeed, a national newspaper had on Saturday reported that the judgment giving control of Kano APC to Shekarau was a setback for presidential ambition of Tinubu.\n\nBut Senator had not at any time indicated that he is opposed to the former Lagos governor\u2019s speculated presidential ambition.\n\nAt an event at Bayero University Kano on Saturday, Governors Kayode Fayemi and Abubakar Badaru of Ekiti and Jigawa states respectively addressed Ahmadu Haruna Zago as Kano APC\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe recognition of Danzago as Kano APC Chairman by Fayemi, who is also said to be interested in the 2023 presidential ticket of APC was widely reported in national newspapers.\n\nSo, was Tinubu\u2019s meeting with Shekarau a move to get the court sanctioned Kano APC overlord to his side or a trouble shooting effort in a troubled chapter by a concerned party chieftain? Only time will tell.",

          "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden\u2019s infectious disease adviser has punctured the global alarm about the new Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Sunday, Fauci described the disease caused by the variant, as not severe.\n\n\u201cThus far it does not look like there\u2019s a great degree of severity to it,\u201d he said.\n\nFauci added that it was too early to draw definitive conclusions and that more study is needed.\n\nFauci said he also hoped the United States would lift its ban on travellers from southern African countries in a \u201creasonable period of time.\u201d\n\nThe South African government has complained it is being punished \u2013 instead of applauded \u2013 for discovering the new variant and quickly informing international health officials.\n\nFauci praised South Africa for its transparency and said the U.S. travel ban was imposed at a time \u201cwhen we were really in the dark\u201d and needed time to study the variant.\n\nThough the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread to about one-third of U.S. states, the Delta version remains the majority of COVID-19 infections as cases rise nationwide.\n\nAt least 16 U.S. states have reported Omicron cases: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nMany of the cases were among fully vaccinated individuals with mild symptoms, although the booster shot status of some patients was not reported.\n\nDespite several dozen Omicron cases, the Delta variant still accounts for 99.9% of new COVID cases in the United States, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe are everyday hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,\u201d she said.\n\nThe United States over the last seven days has averaged 119,000 new cases a day and lost nearly 1,300 lives to COVID each day, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nLouisiana currently has one Omicron case from an individual who traveled within the United States, its health department said on Sunday.\n\nThe emergence of the new variant has sharply curtailed the number of energy executives and government ministers planning to attend the four-day World Petroleum Congress in Houston this week, which had already been rescheduled from 2020.\n\nBut travel restrictions and worries over the new variant saw energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Argentina, Equatorial Guinea, Greece, Turkey and Romania \u2013 bowed out, WPC officials said on Sunday.\n\nGovernors of two states with reported Omicron cases \u2014 Connecticut and Colorado \u2014 said they hoped their higher-than-average vaccination rates would blunt the impact.\n\n\u201cWe want to see how well the vaccinations hold up,\u201d Colorado\u2019s Jared Polis told ABC.\n\nAs U.S. Omicron cases emerge, COVID-19 vaccine makers aim to quickly tweak their shots to target the variant and U.S. regulators have vowed speedy reviews, but that could still take months.",

We are not interested in the grassroots. Once it\u2019s a few months to elections, Igbo politicians will start visiting churches in remote villages, that is the sense of a trader, not a politician.\u201d\n\n\u201dLet me be very frank with all on why Igbos may never produce a president but play second fiddle by asking who is coming out in Igbo land? You\u2019ll tell me it\u2019s Rochas Okorocha, Anyim Pius Anyim, Sam Ohuabunwa among others but since Pius became the Senate President, how many times have you seen him and others in Imo State. The presidency is not a local government election .\u201d\n\nHe said,\u201d Today, people are talking about the 2023 presidency and I ask those Igbo politicians claiming to be interested in the race what have they been doing to galvanize the grassroots.\u201d\n\nHe further queried,\u201d Why is it that an Igbo man is only interested in meeting people only when it\u2019s a few months to any election. It\u2019s arrant nonsense. If the program organized by Mezie Imo Clergy Forum today was held in Yoruba land or the North, this place will be filled with great personalities but here the reverse is the case\u201d\n\n\u201d A good politician works before he shows his ambition. A good politician works before galvanizing for election, that is why I said an Igbo man is a trader, not a politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a presidential aspirant, you need to move around, increase your horizon and coordinate with other zones even before now.\u201d",

We know, for example, that there have been no fatalities.\n\n\u201cThere have also been no reports of very severe illness. Actually, the rationale for being so hasty in putting countries on the red list is not something that is very helpful.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO\n\nCOVID-19: Nigeria Confirms First Cases Of Omicron Variant\n\nAngola Shuts Borders To Regional Neighbours Over New COVID-19 Variant\n\nOmicron Variant: Canada Bans Travellers From Nigeria, Egypt And Malawi\n\nAccording to the minister, the move was ill-advised as he noted that it would have multiple impacts on commerce, and disrupt activities during the Christmas and New Year festivities.\n\n\u201cIt is going to disrupt commerce,\u201d he added. It is going to disrupt family reunions.\u201d\n\nBan List Not \u2018Helpful\u2019\n\nHe explained that while Nigeria has detected the COVID-19 virus on travellers from the UK, the cases have not been confirmed to be the Omicron variant.\n\nWhile reiterating that the placement of countries on the red list will not help in the global fight against the pandemic, Ehanire said Nigeria is anticipating the fourth wave of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf every country were going to put other countries on the ban list, very soon you would have a large number of countries on your red list,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cSo, I do believe there are other ways of going about it. We in Nigeria do not regard banning flights and movements of people as particularly helpful and supportive.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s move, which came a few days after Nigeria detected the new strain, followed a similar decision by the Canadian authorities.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals who have transited or stayed in these 10 countries cannot enter Canada if they have been in those countries in the last two weeks,\u201d Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos told a press conference.\n\nAside from Nigeria, Egypt and Malawi were the other countries recently added to Canada\u2019s travel ban list.",
