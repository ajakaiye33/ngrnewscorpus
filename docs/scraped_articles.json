          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\n\n\u2026 Spotlight on 84 completed life torching projects in Eket Senatorial District\n\nBy Emmanuel Sam\n\nIt is not for fun that the Akwa Ibom State Government decided to provide a whopping #1 billion to overhaul the physical infrastructure of our educational institutions under the 2021 interministerial direct labour jobs. Research has found that learning environments play a crucial role in student success.\n\nSeveral factors can affect learning ability, including seating, light, noise, and even colour. Students who study in a positive learning environment have been shown to be more motivated, engaged, and have a higher overall learning ability. On the other hand, students learning in poor environments \u2013 those that are uncomfortable, loud, or full of distractions \u2013 will find it far more difficult to absorb information and stay engaged.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Government is conscious of the fact that a positive classroom environment helps improve attention, reduce anxiety, and supports emotional and behavioural regulation of students because when educators foster a positive learning culture; learners are more likely to acquire higher motivation that leads to wonderful learning outcomes.\n\nThe developmental torch of the Deacon Udom Emmanuel led administration arrived Oron where twelve life touching projects were commissioned. In Methodist Primary School, Akanobio, the government reconstructed a four Classroom block, a four Classroom block was constructed at Methodist Senior Science College, Oron, a Girls Hostel at Methodist Science College Oron was renovated, a four Classroom block reconstructed at Government Primary School, Uya Oro Junction 1 and another four Classroom block reconstructed at Government Primary School, Uya Oro Junction 2.\n\nSimilarly, the Headmasters Quarters at Government Primary School, Uya Oro Junction was reconstructed, Mary Hanney Secondary School, Oron today has an eight Classroom block constructed and another four Classroom block, a four Classroom block renovated at Government Primary School, Uko Oyukim, Oron, Community Secondary School, Eyo-Abasi Oron was blessed with a four Classroom block renovated, a four Classroom block renovated at Government Primary School, Ukpata Afaha Eduok while Senior Science School, Oron witnessed the reconstruction of a four Chapel block.\n\nAlso read:\n\nIn Mbo LGA, twelve projects were commissioned which include, the renovated three Classroom block at Central Primary School, Akai Ebughu, a reconstructed four Classroom block at Primary School, Uko Ital, a renovated four Classroom block at Government Primary School, Ewang, an Administration block at Comprehensive Secondary School, Ewang, and a reconstructed four Classroom block for Central Primary School, Akai Ebughu 2.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.

A positive environment is one in which students feel a sense of belonging, trust others, and feel encouraged to tackle challenges, take risks, and ask questions. This explains why the focus of the 2021 Interministerial Direct Labour Jobs is on the education sector and why the Government deserves commendation for the #1billion fund injected into the sector in this regards.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nOur May 29 Special Report explains\n\nBy Babajide Komolafe\n\nAs the nation marks the 22nd year of democracy rule, the economy is still marked with poor macroeconomic performance with pockets of improvement in some sectors.\n\nIn terms of improvement, most notable is the telecommunication sector, which again, recorded the highest growth rate of 6.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year (Q1\u201921). This is due to the full liberalisation of the sector and entrance of the mobile telephone companies. As a result, the country now has 216 million connected telephone lines at the end of March 2021. This is a country that could only boast of less than 500,000 lines before the year 2000 when the telecommunications sector was liberalised.\n\nNext is the banking sector, where a combination of recapitalisation exercises, introduction of varying reforms measures including cashless policy, Biometric Verification Number (BVN) has led to increased adoption and geometric rise in the use of electronic channels for payment of goods and services. As a result, the value of electronic payment transactions rose to N21.9 trillion in 2020 from less than N200 billion 2006.\n\nAnother pocket of improvement in the story of Nigeria\u2019s economy is the emergence of the pension sector. Thanks to the Pension Reform Act of 2004, which was amended in 2014, Nigeria now has a pension industry comprising 25 Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs), four Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs), with pension assets of N12.3 trillion as at the end of March 2021.\n\nWeak Economic Growth\n\nNotwithstanding these laudable improvements, the economy is still characterised by weak Gross Domestic Growth (GDP) growth amidst steady population growth.\n\nThough the average GDP growth rate during the 22 years of democracy stands at 5.1 per cent, average growth for the past six years (2015-2020) is 0.68 per cent, far below the average population growth rate of about 2.5 per cent per annum since 1999.\n\nThe impact of this growth trend on the populace is rising unemployment and poverty levels. The rate of unemployment rose to 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 (Q4\u20192020) from 3.79 per cent in 1999.\n\nThe result is the persistent high level of poverty incidence in the country. According to the NBS, 40.1 per cent of Nigerians are living below the poverty line of N137,430 per annum in 2019. Further more, the country became the World Poverty Capital in 2018. According to the World Poverty Clock compiled by Brookings Institute, United States, Nigeria in 2018 overtook India as the country with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty, with an estimated 87 million Nigerians, or around half of the country\u2019s population, estimated thought to be living on less than $1.90 a day.\n\nCauses of Weak Economic Growth\n\nA major cause of Nigeria\u2019s weak economic growth is the mono-product nature of the economy in terms of revenue source.\n\nIn spite of various pronouncements, policy measures and efforts to diversify the revenue base of the country, crude oil has continued to dominate government revenue and foreign exchange income.\n\nCBN data shows that oil revenue accounted for 48 per cent of total revenue into the federation account in 2020.\n\nConsequently, Nigeria\u2019s economy is continuously exposed and has suffered severely from sharp decline or fluctuations in prices of crude oil as experienced in 2008, 2014 and last year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNaira depreciation\n\nAnother fall out of the country\u2019s over dependence on crude oil is the unending trend of naira depreciation.\n\nDuring the three periods of sharp decline in crude oil price indicated above, the nation recorded sharp decline in dollar earnings and also in the external reserves, leading to dollar scarcity in the economy and hence rise in the exchange rate.\n\nThus from N89 per dollar at the end of 1999, the exchange rate rose steadily to N410 per dollar. This implies the 360 per cent depreciation of the naira during the 22 years of democracy.\n\nInflation and deficit spending\n\nResulting from the unending trend of Naira depreciation as well as the heavy import dependent nature of the country, the economy has been characterised by rising prices of goods and services, with the inflation rate mostly in the double digit zones (above 10 per cent). For example, the annual inflation rate has been above 10 per cent since February 2016.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the economy has been characterized by rising fiscal deficits and public debt due to the over reliance on oil for revenue and export earnings worsened by the spells of sharp decline in crude oil prices.\n\nAccording to data by the Federal Ministry of Finance, the FG recorded deficit spending of N6.1 trillion in 2020. This represents a 5,765 per cent increase from N104 billion in 2000.\n\nAlso due to increased borrowing to fund the fiscal deficit, total public debt rose to N32.9 trillion in Q1\u201921 from N7.55 trillion in 2012. This represents an increase of 336 per cent.\n\nParlous infrastructure\n\nAnother major factor that contributed to the weak performance of the economy during the 22 years of democracy is the continued parlous state of the nation\u2019s infrastructure be it electricity, road and railway.\n\nEven after 22 years of democracy and privatisation of power distribution companies and generating companies, power supply is mostly below 5,000MW, while the average Nigerian home enjoys less than nine hours daily power supply.\n\nFurthermore, businesses still rely more on trucks to move goods across a network of roads mostly characterized by potholes, irritating police road blocks even amidst threat of kidnap and armed robbery attacks.\n\nInsecurity\n\nThe country has been facing serious security challenges that have badly affected investments, agriculture, education and human lives lately. It has been a sad commentary from the northeast to the northwest. North central has not been spared. And now Southwest, southeast and south south have all been battling serious security conditions that government\u2019s policy to diversify the economy has remained unaccomplished. Terrorism, Kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery have made many parts of Nigeria unsafe, denying the economy investors and tremendously cutting down on food production which has contributed to inflation.\n\nWay Forward\n\nStressing the necessity of economic diversification while highlighting measures needed to tackle the challenge of weak GDP growth and over dependence on crude for revenue, analysts at Financial Derivatives Company, said: \u201cThe Nigerian government needs to intensify its revenue generation efforts and step up measures towards economic diversification to reduce its vulnerability to oil price shocks.\n\n\u201cThe current focus on the development of the agriculture sector is commendable. However, there is the need for an effective monitoring process to track the progress of several agriculture interventions schemes and areas requiring improvement.\n\n\u201cThe government should also adopt business friendly economic policies to encourage growth in other sectors of the economy such as manufacturing, mining, trading and ICT.\n\n\u201cThis will help broaden the government\u2019s revenue base and reduce reliance on oil. Moreover, the government needs to be committed to fiscal discipline to prevent an increase in the country\u2019s debt burden and the risk of a credit rating downgrade.\u201d\n\nCredible election challenge\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nSince the return to civil rule in 1999, one of the challenges Nigeria has been trying to surmount is that of conducting credible elections.\n\nBeginning from the first series of elections on December 5, 1998 when the first local council polls of the Fourth Republic were conducted to the 2019 general elections, balloting has been characterised by ballot snatching, falsification of figures, fielding of unqualified candidates, malfunctioning of card readers, intimidation and harassment of voters, and violence among others.\n\nConsequently, the outcome of many elections have been nullified by the courts, a reason we now have staggered governorship elections in eight states.\n\nSo far, transmission of election results is still an issue. Diaspora and electronic voting is far from sight. Already, future polls and the 2023 general polls are being threatened by insecurity, and burning of Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC offices and electoral materials by arsonists. In less than 24 months, the commission has suffered 41 attacks across the country.\n\nAttempts by the National Assembly to give Nigerians an amended Electoral Act that will take care of some of these challenges did not hit the bull\u2019s eye because President Muhammadu Buhari did not assent the bill and the lawmakers could not veto him with two-third majority.\n\nLess than two years to the 2023 polls, it is uncertain if a new electoral act will be in place.\n\nSpeaking on these issues, Chief Chekwas Okorie, founder of the United Progressives Party, UPP, and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, lamented that Nigeria\u2019s democracy has been roundly manipulated, occasioning socio-economic, developmental and political set backs.\n\nHis words: \u201cYes, Nigeria has been in a democratic governance for an unbroken period of 22 years but our democracy has been mostly checkered, manipulated and exploitative.\n\n\u201cAt the commencement of the present democratic dispensation in 1999, the outgoing military administration led by Gen Abdul salami Abubakar, in conspiracy with some retired military Generals decided who they preferred to become elected President of Nigeria. They settled for retired General Olusegun Obasanjo who was then serving prison terms for purported accessory to a failed coup d\u2019etat. Processes were quickly put in place for his eventual victory at the polls, which was largely manipulated and contrived.\n\n\u201cThat election marked the beginning of the continuous short-changing of the Nigerian electorate of their inalienable right to choose legitimately elected leaders at all the strata of our elections.\n\n\u201cThis fundamentally flawed process of leadership recruitment instituted in 1999 and consolidated over the years has been largely responsible for the poor and corrupt political leadership that has adversely inflicted Nigeria and Nigerians with retarded and scandalous political, economic and social development and growth.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigerians began to recover albeit slowly their right to elect their leaders democratically, beginning with the 2015 general election. Again in 1999 the outgoing military government foisted on hapless Nigerians an obnoxious Constitution which concentrated political powers at the centre and denied the federating units the latitude to explore and exploit their comparative advantages for economic growth and expansion.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cThe constitutional amendment process currently embarked upon by the 9th National Assembly provides the country with a last ditch window to address the several ills of our federalism. A comprehensive amendment of our Constitution including the Electoral Act is about the only hope we have for the sustainability and stability of Nigeria as a sovereign nation.\u201d\n\nEducation: Reeling under serious threats\n\nBy Adesina Wahab\n\nThere is no doubt that since the start of the Fourth Republic in 1999, a lot has been happening in the education sector. More schools have sprung up at all levels, the government and the private sector doing the show. For instance, with one private university, the Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State being licensed as at 1999, the nation now has 99 licensed private universities and many more are still waiting in the wing. The Federal Government has 43 degree awarding institutions, while the various state governments have 48. The number of public and private primary and secondary schools runs into thousands.\n\nHowever, with a population put at about 200 million, the nation cannot be said to have enough schools at all levels, even though the figures have gone up.\n\nHas access to education improved?\n\nAn education expert, Mr John Akinleye, opined that while there are more schools than before, access to education has not really improved.\n\n\u201cStarting with primary school level, despite the implementation of free primary education in states across the country, many children are still not in school. We all know some of the factors responsible for this. Moreover, is it not surprising that some state governments are denying their citizens free primary education by not paying the counterpart funds to give their State Universal Basic Education Boards access to funds from the Universal Basic Education Commission?\n\n\u201cA number of states have been suspended from accessing funds by UBEC because some are in the habit of using the funds for other things. If it is at secondary school level, the number of public secondary schools is not growing to meet up with the population growth rate and not all parents can afford to send their wards to private schools.\n\n\u201cThe tertiary education system is hard hit. Over 2,000,000 candidates would sit for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, less than 500,000 would be admitted. Also, not all parents and guardians can afford to send their wards to foreign universities, \u201c he noted.\n\nMisery Index factors\n\nMisery Index simple means how the rate of unemployment and inflation affects the well being of the citizens of a country. The Head of Department of Economics, Lagos State University, LASU, Prof. Ibraheem Bakare, in a recent interview with our corespondent, said unemployment and high inflationary trend in Nigeria have not only affected the well being of the people negatively, but also eroded some of the gains made earlier in the education sector.\n\n\u201cThere is no way the number of out-of-school children, OSC, would not increase. Parents and guardians that are supposed to cater for the need of the children are barely surviving. Many have lost their jobs and unfortunately, in this clime, there are no social safety nets to cushion the effects of such happenings on the people.\n\n\u201cEven some palliative steps the various governments are taking or promising such as school feeding programme, how effectively are they being implemented? Most government policies are not implemented to favour the average citizens, \u201c he noted.\n\nPoor funding of the sector\n\nAccording to the National President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities ASUU, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, only God knows when Nigeria would comply with international standards of allocating enough funds to education. \u201cSince the beginning of the current democratic dispensation, Nigeria has not allocated up to the recommended percentage to the sector. In fact, we barely have 10 percent. In the last few years, it has been worse. If we don\u2019t have the funding that is necessary, how do we progress and compete with other nations?\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, if we are even able to maintain the level we were in the 1970s to the 1980s when we had foreign students and lecturers in our universities, it would be good. We have agitated endlessly for a better funding of the sector, \u201c he said.\n\nInsecurity, a novel hindrance\n\nWhen in April 2014, school girls from Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State were abducted, it was a novel way of hammering education and creating fear in students, teachers and parents.\n\n\u201cNow, our innocent children have become objects of merchandise. They have become what some criminal elements now use to make illicit money. We now have to begin to bargain how much to pay or not to pay to secure their release, \u201c said Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, the National President of the National Parent Teacher Association of Nigeria, NAPTAN.\n\nAfter the Chibok experience, another set of school children were kidnapped in Dapchi, Yobe State in 2015. Between last December and April, this year, no fewer than 800 students have been abducted from schools across some states in the Northern part of the country.\n\n\u201cWhere is the Safe School Initiative? asked the National Secretary of the Nigeria Union of Teachers, NUT, Dr Mike Ene. According to him, some people simply wanted to dissuade others from going to school. \u201cOur government knew from previous experiences that schools have become soft targets for criminal elements, but what steps have they taken to prevent a recurrence? This is a great setback to education, \u201che said\n\nThe most painful aspect of attacks on educational institutions so far has been the kidnap of students of Greenfield University in Kaduna. Five of the students have been killed and some are still kept at an unknown destination as at press time.\n\nHave we done well?\n\nGoing by submissions by various stakeholders in the sector, it appears that the country has rather taken some steps backwards while taking one forward. This is evident in the country becoming the global capital of out-of-school children, about 15 million.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has warned Nigerians to be wary of IGVM, a file-encrypting Ransomware infection.\n\nThe IGVM, according to the agency, restricts access to data (documents, images, videos) by encrypting files with the \u201cigvm\u201d extension.\n\nThe warning was contained in a statement signed by Mrs Hadiza Umar, Head, Corporate Affairs and External Relations of NITDA and made available to reporters in Abuja on Saturday.\n\nNITDA explained that IGVM attempts to extort money from victims by requesting for \u201cransom\u201d, in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrency in exchange for access to data.\n\nThis crypto-virus, according to the agency, spread in different methods like web injectors, pirated software, spam emails, malicious software bundles, fake software updates, and deceiving online ads.\n\nNITDA explains that the primary task of the crypto-virus is to check the users computer system for target file formats and encrypt them using a private RSA key.\n\nThe agency further explained that once virus locks the files, it then runs several commands via CMD.exe to delete Volume Shadow Copies from the system.\n\nThe virus can also stop the victims from restoring their file copies for free, using Windows tools and can also modify Windows HOSTS file by adding a list of domains to it.\n\nAccording to NITDA, these domains are mostly computer or IT-related websites, so the attackers capitalize on this measure to prevent the victim from seeking help or information online.\n\nThe agency hereby urged the general public to follow these recommendations:\n\n\u201cEnsure regular data backup and recovery plan for all critical information.\n\n\u201cUse application whitelisting to help prevent malicious software and unapproved programs from running.\n\n\u201cKeep operating system and software up-to-date with the latest patches.\n\n\u201cMaintain up-to-date anti-virus software, and scan all software downloaded from the internet before installing.\n\n\u201cDo not follow unsolicited web links in emails. Do not download or open suspicious email attachments.\n\n\u201cDo not open emails from suspicious recipients.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, if paying up seems like the only reason to get your files back, we strongly advise against ransom payments.\n\nNITDA added that various cybersecurity experts do not recommend paying up due to the following reasons:\n\n\u201cThe criminals might stop responding as soon as you transfer money to their virtual wallet address.\n\n\u201cThe so-called decryption tool can be faulty or fail to work due to data modification on your end avoiding funding this illegal business model.

          "text": "The Zamfara State Government has commented that following the recent escalation and the wave of attacks by bandits in some parts of the State, it has become necessary for the State Government to further explain its previous and current position as well as additional measures being taken to contain the situation.\n\nThis was stated in a press statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on media and publicity, Hon. Zailani Nappa which he made available to newsmen in Gusau, the State capital.\n\nAccording to him, the administration of Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle accords security a topmost attention, saying that since its inception precisely two years ago, it has carefully examined the situation and evaluated the available options.\n\n\u201cIt consequently decided on the best way to address the lingering crisis that was increasingly assuming inter communal and ethnic dimensions through dialogue and reconciliation with the feuding parties. This is in consideration of the fact that no meaningful development company would be achieved if decisive and workable steps are not taken to address the problem at hand\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to the dialogue and reconciliation programme, the administration of Governor Bello Matawalle provided all the needed support required by our security agencies to enable them carry out their statutory responsibility more effectively. As you may recall, one of these is the procurement and distribution of 200 brand new vehicles to the security forces. There are a host of other supports being extended to the security forces by the administration\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spite of employment of both kinetic and non \u2013 kinetic strategy to defeat this nagging problem, the recent escalation in attacks by bandits in most parts of the State is a serious source of concern. It appears, or even certain, that some forces are bent on frustrating the efforts of this administration to address the security challenge. It is inconceivable that these attacks have been conducted despite the effective deployment of troops across all the black spots in the State\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the above light, the Hon Commissioner of Security and Home Affairs, Alh. Abubakar Muhammad Dauran, had observed that part of the hurdles hindering the success of the fight against banditry in the state is the lack of quick response by the Security forces in the wake of attacks by bandits. Hence, all commanders deployed in the state are enjoined to take necessary measures that will ensure rapid response to distress calls\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, government is aware of the challenges faced by security commands especially as they seemed obviously overstretched.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the obvious shortfall, Government requests that special consideration should be given to Zamfara State in terms of the deployment of more forces for quicker response to all security threats\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle commends the overall assessment of gallantry and commitment of our troops and other security operatives in the state, the Government and good people of Zamfara State will always thank and appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari for the concern and total support he shows on the plight of Zamfara citizens in the ongoing fight against banditry and other criminalities\u201d",

          "title": "MAY 29 SPECIAL: Nothing has changed under Buhari \u2013Gen. Ishola-Williams",
          "text": "Renowned anti-corruption crusader, Maj. Gen Ola Ishola-Williams (retd) has declared that imposing a state of emergency on the nation will not solve insecurity and other challenges currently facing the nation. Making the assertion in an interview with TUNDE THOMAS, the retired General regretted that nothing has changed in the polity under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. Noting that those in charge of the nation\u2019s security are incompetent, Gen Williams asserted that insecurity and other socio-economic challenges can only be surmounted if President Muhammadu Buhari takes timely political decisions on the issues so as to prevent them from festering.\n\nThe present state of insecurity in the country has become a source of serious concern. How would you react to the ugly development and what is the way out?\n\nI don\u2019t think we have a problem of insecurity in Nigeria. What we have mostly is problem of public safety. We don\u2019t have insecurity because no nation is engaging us in war. All these problems of kidnapping, and abductions are not that of insecurity but that of public safety. What we have is that the people are not safe. The South West went ahead and created Amotekun, and with the creation of the outfit, security is improving in the South-West. The South East have also created their own which they call Ebubeagu. Some states in the north created Hisbah long time ago. And in every state, there are vigilantes. So there is confusion all over the place as to who is responsible for the public safety. It is for the National Assembly to have a look at the situation and say, with the situation we have in this country now, do we not need to have a law that will remove all these confusions or reduce the confusions to the minimum and remove the issue of vigilantes?\n\nNow that they have set up Amotekun by law in each South-West state, what is left for the National Assembly is to regularise the situation. And for those who are shouting about Amotekun, what is the meaning of Hisbah? Is Hisbah is not a government agency like Amotekun? So why are they crying about Amotekun and they are not talking about Hisbah?\n\nBut I also want to emphasise the importance of community policing. Without community policing, we can\u2019t solve most of these problems. If we don\u2019t have community policing, there is going to be serious problems because the Nigeria Police as presently constituted can\u2019t solve the security challenges facing the country. Again because of the corruption going on in the security agencies, they don\u2019t want any change in the status quo, and it is not their fault. The fault is with Mr President.\n\nBuhari should have given a marching order to those in charge of the nation\u2019s security architecture, giving them an ultimatum on the security issues, especially kidnapping, and banditry. The nation\u2019s present security architecture is not working. Those in charge of our security system are not working. They are incompetent.\n\nAnytime kidnapping or abduction happen, the President will address Nigerians and give assurance that the situation is under control but the situation continues getting worse. They keep on holding security meetings but nothing is improving. They keep on spending billions of naira on security but nothing is improving. This is why I\u2019m happy about the recent Southern governors meeting. I\u2019m happy that they eventually met and took far reaching decisions at the end of their meeting. Looking at the situation of things in the country, at times it appears as if nobody is in charge. Buhari has refused to take decisions, often crucial decisions that can help to move the nation forward. As the Commander-in \u2013chief, Buhari has enormous powers to make things happen but he seems not to be keen on doing the needful. We need to re-organise the nation\u2019s security architecture, if we do this, we will see positive results manifesting. But only Buhari knows why he is not taking the right actions.\n\nAre you saying President Buhari is not doing what he supposed to do?\n\nIf he has done what he was supposed to do, are we going to be in this kind of situation now? We will not be. There is no doubt about that. Everybody all over the country has told him and even if he doesn\u2019t read newspapers, somebody must have told him about what is happening in the country. So the issue is, he knows what is happening and if you tell him something is happening, he would say we are going to deal with them but that is the end of the story. There is no strategy at all.\n\nThis is what is very funny about the presidential system. The people turn the president to a semi-god, who has answers to all the problems. It is a big mistake. That is why he has advisers but unfortunately one single man will take responsibility. If he is old and sick what do you expect and if he has bad advisers and he cannot sack them, then that man is compounding problems for himself. If you are the president and there are so many problems going all over the place, it means your advisers are not in touch nor are they well informed enough to be able to advise you on what action to take. What do you do? You change them for some other people who can do a better job. But he did not and the problem keeps compounding itself and he continues to fill the same people and there is more problem.\n\nOn the lingering Boko Haram war, how do we win the battle against the insurgency which has been going on for almost 20 years?\n\nIt appears Buhari\u2019s government is no longer keen about the war. They will just continue like that until they hand over to another government in 2023. They are no longer giving the insurgency the attention it deserves, and that\u2019s why they are not tackling it with all the seriousness it deserves. Buhari\u2019s government is more bothered about handing over the war against the insurgents to another government in 2023.\n\nBuhari inherited Boko-Haram war, and so he also wants to pass it to another government. Buhari\u2019s government is not serious about defeating Boko Haram. If this government is keen on winning the Boko-Haram war, the military needs to be re-organised. It is also obvious that the morale is very low among the troops. The military has enough equipment and enough men to be able to defeat Boko Haram but they also need to deploy the right tactics. Secondly, the military are dissipating all their energies on the job which the mobile police should be doing .It is not their business to be fighting bandits and kidnappers. It is not their business to be protecting the highways. The military should focus primarily on fighting the insurgents in the North-East. They should be re-organised properly and focus on the war against Boko Haram. Intelligence gathering is also key to winning the war against the insurgents. Our military should be involved in more of intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence. I believe that with the right strategies, and the morale being high among our troops then taming the insurgents should not be a problem.\n\nOn 2023, where do you stand between merit and zoning?\n\nMy position is this: we should retain zoning as it has been in practice since 1999. Merit is okay but for equity and justice, and for the sake of the nation\u2019s unity, we should not jettison zoning. My take is that the two political parties \u2013 APC and PDP -should zone the Presidency to the South, and when they do that they should take it to the South-East. It should be the turn of the South-East, having being the only zone yet to have it since 1999. The people of the South-East should now ensure that they pick people of integrity as candidates.\n\nFears are being expressed that the 2023 elections may not hold as a result of the present state of insecurity. Do you harbour such concerns?\n\nFor those expressing fears about whether 2023 elections will hold or not, I don\u2019t see any reason for that. Although there have been attacks on INEC offices across the country, especially in the South-East, I don\u2019t think the situation is dire enough to warrant a postponement. Even with on-going war against insurgency in the North, that is not enough an excuse to postpone the polls.\n\nSome have expressed fear that recent agitations for self-determination by some groups could lead to the break-up of the country. What\u2019s your take?\n\nThere is nothing new or strange about people talking about self-determination. That happens all over the world. There is nothing new about that. There is no country in the world where people are satisfied with the status quo. People always clamour for change. As for Nigeria breaking up, I don\u2019t believe in it. What we need to do is to address various challenges confronting us as a nation. I don\u2019t believe in secession. What we need to do to stop all these agitations here and there if for us to restructure.\n\nRestructuring will go a long way in addressing bottled grievances among the various ethnic groups across the country. We should return to the true practice of federalism as practised in the First Republic Constitution. I don\u2019t know why this government appears to be foot-dragging on the issue of restructuring. The point is this, there is no alternative to restructuring. Even the President\u2019s own party, APC set up a committee on the issue headed by Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai which recommended restructuring. Almost everybody is now clamouring for it. Even at the recent meeting of the Southern governors, restructuring was one of their key demands for moving the nation forward. Whether we like it or not, there is no alternative to it, and running away from it is like postponing the evil day.\n\nThe APC came to office promising to transform the country, but some Nigerians are saying that nothing has actually changed. Do you agree?\n\nThe whole system has not changed at all. So when the president is talking that there has been improvements, nothing has changed for Nigeria under Buhari\u2019s leadership. And then you look at the case of corruption. Look at the EFCC, look at the ICPC, they have a backload of cases. They were told by so many people to establish a corruption tribunal, a special corruption tribunal. That has been over two years ago. They have been talking about it but the National Assembly has kicked against it. Nobody is fighting corruption. Corruption has been on the increase, and there is nothing Buhari can do about it. Forget about anybody saying Buhari fighting corruption. There is nothing Buhari can do about it. It is not the same Buhari that Nigerians used to know in the days of the military that is the Buhari that we have today.\n\nConcerns are being expressed over the high rate at which the Federal Government is taking foreign loans. What\u2019s your reaction to that?\n\nIt is alarming, and very worrisome. They are mortgaging the future of coming generations. But the point is this: we can never develop. We will continue to borrow money and part of this money will be going to private pockets and people\u2019s accounts all over the world. People are running away from Europe now, but they are putting their money into accounts in the Middle East, Dubai and all those places in the United Arab Emirates. Look at disciplined services like the Armed Forces. They changed the Head of the Armed Forces and those who came after them say the money you gave our predecessor to buy weapons, we can\u2019t found the weapons now. And what did they do? They appointed them as ambassadors! Where in this world can you see that? And the same people now and the same corrupt National Assembly is now asking us to set up a Public Trust Fund for the Armed Forces like they have done for the police. They give out mobile policemen to guide individuals. They pay the police for the services of the mobile police. Is that money part of the police budget? It is not. Where does the money go? It is shared. Or where does the money go if it is not shared and they are not part of the police budget? And when you ask the police, they will say they have no money. But I have not seen any Inspector General of Police or head of any agency that is poor.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former Ambassador to Ukraine, Ibrahim Kasai, has charged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the 2023 presidency to the South in the spirit of common sense, fairness, equity and justice. Kasai, a member of the Board of Trustees, Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Organisation, also lamented that President Muhammadu Buhari has not rewarded many people who worked hard to actualise his emergence as president in 2015 and 2019. He spoke with GYANG BERE in Jos.\n\nAre you satisfied with the way the president has been running the country?\n\nWell, I am happy with the infrastructural development, but I am not satisfied with the security problems that we are having in the country. It is disturbing and part of it was when the president changed the service chiefs. We had some ray of hope that maybe the security architecture will change the style of their assignment. We are hoping that good results would be achieved. We know that there is a general economic problem, but many politicians, including myself are not too happy because of neglect. Compensation is an important embodiment of politics. There is no need to pretend about it. The Buhari administration should look for people that have been left out. The President needs to look for a way of reaching to certain people that have been neglected out of this government. You can\u2019t give everybody job but there is much job to be done, some people are there telling the President that there is no money, but wealth is created using creativity. Even jobs for our youths. It is the brain that creates the jobs.\n\nHow much are other tiers of government doing to complement the Federal Government in terms of generating internal revenue? We don\u2019t need to fold our arms and wait for allocation from the federation account. Look at the IGR of states for instance. How much do you think states should be generating? Everybody should hold his constituency and say, let me do my best in revenue generation. If that is done, we will move somewhere. But it looks as if since there is oil money, everybody is folding his arms to wait for it. We should know that the days of oil have gone. So the question of abandoning people for lack of money to pay allowances is not fair. There are some agencies that you can\u2019t run them without board members. It is a crime to run an agency without a board. It is not in the architecture of government to run universities, polytechnics and some agencies without boards. Somebody must supervise. Why was Balarabe Musa removed as governor? He didn\u2019t commit any crime, but that he used Permanent Secretaries to take decisions instead of appointing commissioners. So for that breach of the constitution, he was removed from office. Many people have been waiting since 2015 and they have not been appointed. I am one of them, I am not saying this because I am affected but so many people are out there waiting to be appointed.\n\nNone of the major political parties, the APC and the PDP have come out to say the presidential seat should be zoned to any zone. But based on the principles of common sense, where do you think the presidency should be zoned in 2023?\n\nI do much believe in the theory of common sense and I saw on social media recently that the APC has zoned the presidential seat to the South, although I don\u2019t know how authentic that is. But if that is true, it is a good development. That has been my advocacy. By common sense, presidency should go to the South. For PDP, they have an instrument that alternates the zones between the North and South. When we were in PDP, we know of that but if they are changing now, it is okay for them. It is my idea that such zoning arrangements should come to play. If it is true that APC has zoned the presidency to the South, it is a step in the right direction. It will be fair that presidency should go to the South in 2023.\n\nBut we have seen Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, North Central moving round the country to solicit support for his presidential ambition?\n\nIf it is true that the presidency has been zoned to the South, then it will be wrong for him to come out because that will contradict that zoning arrangement. He is not a small member in the party. A governor is respected in the party and I think he should know better. Although I have not seen any document or heard a pronouncement from the leaders of the party that the presidency has been zoned to the South, but if what I saw on the social media is true, then it will not be right for anybody from the North to come out. Some jokers can come out, if they want to test their popularity. You cannot stop him. He can print posters and start campaigning, but I don\u2019t think he can be screened to contest by the party.\n\nWill you advise the APC constitution review committee to make zoning an official policy of the party?\n\nThat might be outside the constitution. I don\u2019t think it should be a constitutional matter. Certain decisions are taken by the Board of Trustees, because their main function is to give directive to the party and to hold in trust the property of the party. That is usually done after exhaustive consultations so that the country will move in the right direction. I also don\u2019t know if that is part of the scope of the assignment of the committee. And if that is part of it, fine, they can go ahead and incorporate zoning in the APC constitution.\n\nWhat should be done to encourage internal democracy and fairness within the APC ahead of 2023?\n\nYou will recall that in our previous engagement, I have always talked about the constitution of the party. A constitution is a working document that guides likeminded individuals. And as a political party like the ruling APC, it needs a solid and enduring constitution because a political party in Nigeria that has produced a president is not a small group. When I heard that a committee has been set up to review the party\u2019s constitution, I was the happiest person because that is what I have been talking on. If you look at the existing document, you will laugh and wonder whether the party has been serious at all because there are so many flaws and definitely the construction needs a review. We are getting to another election and you can\u2019t face the national convention of the party without a fresh, reviewed party constitution for the people to be approved. A national convention is a gathering of party members where critical and very important decisions are taken for the party. I was impressed when I heard of the composition of the committee, which is made up of very important legal luminaries and I believe they will do justice to the assignment and to Nigerians. I believe they will come up with a very solid party constitution.\n\nWhat sections of the constitution will you advise them to review to ensure fairness in the party?\n\nFirstly, in membership, and secondly on sustainability of the party on power. There are so many other aspects, but majorly the methodology of handling critical aspects of the party, that is the congress and engaging candidates on contesting election. A selection process is very critical to a political party. If you don\u2019t have a very good selection process, you will spend the whole of your time on litigation. The party will be taking its members to court and the members also taking the party to court. The leaders with be dishing out sanctions against misdeeds if the party is not firm on a matter. For instance, when it comes to the selection of the president or a governor of a state, the primaries that will produce a presidential candidate, governorship candidate or senatorial candidate, if the decision is not firm, there will be problem. The present constitution says candidates can be selected through direct or indirect primaries and that is too ambiguous. Some people can explore that and do what they want. A state chapter can decide to influence a decision to go the way of those who have money in the party. If you say indirect primaries, if you don\u2019t have money, you can\u2019t win that type of election. But if you say direct primaries, it means the entire congress and every party member can participate in the selection of who represent them as president, governor or in other elective positions and that promotes internal democracy. If you don\u2019t promote internal democracy, there is no way democracy will grow in Nigeria and that is what many members of the APC are saying.\n\nAre you saying that APC should produce the 2023 presidential candidate of the party through internal democracy by allowing Nigerians to participate in the primaries?\n\nOf course, that is what I am advocating. Let the people participate in the selection of who will represent them as president, governor, senators and so on. That makes the system participatory and that will show that democracy is at work. That is what we call political engineering. You say indirect primaries, those who are going in are nominated by somebody sitting down somewhere. Either he is in a position of influence, or because he is rich or for other reasons, they will give directives that, go to that local government, get five persons. You move to another and get the same and you will have a gathering of handpicked individuals and they will select who they want. And that will produce corruption, nepotism and all sorts of things and you will come up with a candidate not representing the people. Indirect election is better done when selecting the leadership of the National Assembly. The people don\u2019t go there to do it for them. The 360 of them are already elected by the people and the members can select who lead them and if they hold election and whoever becomes speaker, deputy speaker and so on, that is their business. They understand the language better. Nobody will be there to guide them on what to do. But for a common man to be excluded from the selection of the president he wants from the grassroots is not fair. And the body language of people in the party is towards direct primaries. If you consult any APC member who knows what he is doing, he will tell you that direct primaries are the best for the party.\n\nBut some would say they prefer indirect primaries?\n\nThat process is fading out. Indirect primaries are becoming archaic. People are disenchanted with that. Nigerians can attest to it that either in APC or PDP, wherever they say indirect primaries, you will see people going with bags of money to buy delegates. There is no point hiding it. The issue of buying delegates is what corrupts our political system.\n\nMinister of Communications, Isa Pantami, who reportedly made certain provocative statements in the past, is still serving in Buhari\u2019s cabinet. What is your take?\n\nI also read that in the social media. But sometimes, if you are not sure of the source of information, for you to just comment on it might not be good. But let me say generally that anybody who is linked with such groups should be investigated. No information of such nature should be covered up for any reason.\n\nHow will you advise the president as regards banditry, negotiating with bandits, and so on?\n\nI do know that Mr. President is doing his best in terms of eliminating this banditry and the security agencies are there and they are being attacked and killed. But there are stories of insiders. Sometimes, if you keep things in your house and you discover they are being stolen, if you check well, you will discover that some of the thieves are in your house. What you need to do is to search your house and fish out those bad elements. I am of the view that the various forest reserves that we have should be cut down and new trees planted to replace them. Let\u2019s see where those criminals will be hiding. The Sambisa Forest is large. Let\u2019s see how government will begin to bring down the trees for security reasons.",

          "title": "Lamentation greets 22 years of democracy",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya, Vincent Kalu, Sunday Ani, Oluseye ojo Chukwudi Nweje, and Lukman olabiyi\n\nTwo decades and two years of uninterrupted democracy since 1999 have been largely disappointing for most Nigerians, hardly leaving any cause for celebrations.\n\nThat is the position of a number of prominent Nigerians and groups as the nation\u2019s Fourth Republic clocks 22 years today. The predominant verdict is that despite pockets of achievements, there is nothing much to cheer about Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nFor elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, the apex Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the democratic journey is certainly not a blessing to all those who fought for the nation\u2019s independence in 1960.\n\nHe blamed the military for imposing a unitary government on Nigeria, which has a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-national background.\n\nChief Adebanjo said that Nigeria would never move forward or be in peace until the constitution is changed to accommodate the wishes of the people.\n\nHe cautioned that the nation is currently on a precipice and insisted that the constitution by the military remained the worst plague haunting the country.\n\nThe President of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus declared that the journey had been a mixture of blessing and curse.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have mixed feelings on the issue of democracy. As a way of government, it is a good thing but we have mismanaged our democracy to the extent that we are becoming more autocratic because we are not running things the way they should be run. And that is what has tainted our democracy\u201d.\n\nHe noted that when democracy returned in 1999, Nigerians had high expectations but regretted that not much has been achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWhen the country returned to civil rule in 1999, we thought it was going to usher in all the goodies. Of course, during the Obasanjo period, there was real growth and Nigerians were happy. There was peace. The kind of nepotism we see today was not there visibly. There was balancing; every part of the country was getting its share to some extent. But today, things have changed. The insecurity in the land has worsened to the extent that people don\u2019t feel a sense of belonging. So, the democracy which we have been running has had negative effects on our lives; our psyche and on the way we do things.\u201d\n\nHe said however that there have also been glorious days along the journey. \u201cIt is unfortunate that 22 years after democracy, we are still not out of the woods simply because things are not being done well. But, I can confidently say that it has brought in development in some periods, while in some other periods, we have experienced unnecessary hardships.\u201d\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohaneze Ndigbo, Mr. Alex Ogbonna, said the journey cannot be described as a curse because of the good times that have existed at one period or the other within the entire stretch of 22 years\n\nHe said: \u201cIt cannot be a curse; it is an evolutionary process and we want to believe that future trials in democracy will be far better than the previous ones.\u201d\n\nHe hailed the early days of former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s administration, saying it was a time when democracy flourished, though with pockets of military dictatorship.\n\nHe said: \u201cObasanjo was equitable and fair to all sections of the country to a great extent. But it was still a militarized society, going by the number of impeachments in the Senate, House of Representatives and state Houses of Assembly. It was a militarized society and polity,\u201d he said. He described late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua as a calm president, whose gentle mien calmed down militancy in the Niger Delta. He stated that even with Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s democratic disposition, there was still a silhouette of the military during his time.\n\nHe lamented that even President Muhammadu Buhari who emerged as a president at a time when Nigerians felt disenchanted with former President Goodluck Jonathan is still not living up to the democratic expectation.\n\nHe argued that in the last 22 years of the country\u2019s democracy, what is visible is what one could aptly call democratic dictatorship as a result of the military influence in the polity. Prof Anthony Kila, Director at Centre for International Advanced and Professional Studies (CIAPS) and Publicity Secretary of Yoruba Global Alliance (YGA), a forum of Yoruba professionals said the last 22 years of democracy has been a manifestation of the good, the bad and the ugly. He charged Nigerians to learn to distinguish between democracy and governance and avoid lumping the two together.\n\nBut for an elder statesman from the North, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, the mere fact that Nigeria has sustained 22 years of uninterrupted democratic rule calls for celebration. He berated the media for painting the nation\u2019s democracy in a bad light and criticized them for exaggerating events in Nigeria.\n\nPublicity Secretary of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Emmanuel Yaweh, said the democratic journey has been rough, but also a worthwhile experience.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t gone as smoothly as we expected; hopes were raised. It\u2019s as if democracy was the magic wand to everything we wanted \u2013 good life, freedom, plenty of food, and improved economy, etc. We had a lot of dreams of what democracy was bringing because most of the years since independence we were under military rule and we never really experienced democracy continuously for ten years.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we are having that experience. So we raised our hopes to the extent that by the time it came, it was as if it was all we were asking for. We were somehow let down, hopes dashed by the conduct of our so-called elected leaders. Some of them didn\u2019t conduct themselves in a better way than the military dictators; some even looted the treasury or wanted to loot the treasury.\n\n\u201cCorruption is still there; the tendency of elected leaders to behave as if they were dictators is still there. Somehow, we are disappointed, some even tried to perpetuate themselves in office; we had experience of struggle against Third Term,\u201d Yaweh said.\n\nPresident of Southern Kaduna People\u2019s\u2019 Union, Hon Jonathan Asake, described the 22 years of unbroken democracy as \u2018good\u2019. He said: \u201cThe fact that we have been able to sustain it and it has not be truncated by military or otherwise is a very big victory for the Nigerian people. However, the way I expected it to have developed, isn\u2019t what it is been. Unfortunately, that is my pain and the disappointment that I have.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to have gone beyond this level, especially our national institutions, like INEC, the police, judiciary and other national institutions that are supposed to be strong and give us viral democracy, where leaders will emerge on merit and where votes count.\n\n\u201cWe have found ourselves today where votes don\u2019t count, where we have leaders that just emerge, they ignore the people and continue in rascality, believing that they win elections without the people\u2019s votes. That is where we are actually lacking.\n\n\u201cWe need to strengthen our national institutions either by restructuring or convoking a constitutional conference, where we would abolish this constitution, which was fraudulently introduced to the people of Nigeria by the military. It has caused some serious, unfair and unjust, inequitable treatments of other citizens; where we have master- servant relationship in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary, Agbekoya Farmers Society, Adegbenro Ogunlana said Nigeria would have been better than this if not for the poor leadership and the constitution on ground which he described as a military constitution\n\nExecutive director, Rule of law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), Okechukwu Nwanguma regretted that the expectations of Nigerians for progress and development has been cut short by lack of good governance under successive governments.\n\nRights activist and legal practitioner, Kabir Akingbolu said democracy had not fared well in the country because Nigeria runs an extremely expensive kind of democracy where over seventy per cent of the budget goes for recurrent expenditures which has made growth and development impossible.\n\nFormer Publicity Secretary, Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Lagos Branch, Emeka Nwadioke said: \u201cWhile progress has been made in some sectors, the results have at best been woeful in others. The security situation is especially worrisome. A state of emergency should be declared in that sector. The Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) and the apex self-determination group in Yorubaland, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) have also said there is nothing to celebrate in May 29 2021, which marks the 22nd year of uninterrupted democracy in Nigeria and six years of President Muhammadu Buhari in office. Secretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, and spokesperson for IOO, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, made the assertion in separate interviews with Saturday Sun. They said the day should be one of introspection rather than celebration.",

          "text": "\u2022Predicts critics will give a resounding applause by end of tenure in 2023\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nAs the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration clocks six years today, the Presidency has reeled out major achievements of the regime, with a prediction that even known critics of the President would give a resounding applause to the administration when it finally ends on May 29, 2023.\n\nA statement titled: \u201cThe Buhari Administration At Six: Counting The Blessings One By One\u201d, issued yesterday by the Media Adviser to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, captured the President\u2019s score card under 26 subheads, including extension of over N2 trillion to the 36 states as bail out to pay workers\u2019 salaries and issuance of nine executive orders, as well as assenting to 14 legislative bills.\n\nThe Presidency stressed that the six years of Buhari\u2019s administration afforded it an opportunity to reflect, and recount the impact that had been made, \u201cand is being made on different sectors of national life.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Presidency, the administration is recording giant strides, from infrastructure, to finance, education, healthcare, sports, anti-corruption moves, human development, housing, oil and gas, foreign relations, and many others, enough to make Nigerians proud, \u201cthat is, those who are dispassionate and fair-minded, not beclouded by political partisanship and undue cynicism.\u201d\n\nThe sector by sector breakdown of the achievements of President Buhari from 2015 to 2021, as listed by the Presidency, showed that under infrastructure category, came the Presidential approval, in 2020, for the establishment of InfraCo Plc, a world class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, and managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\nOther efforts under this category include the establishment in 2020 of the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), with more than $1 billion in funding so far.\n\nOn investment committed to rail transportation in the country, the statement listed the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail nearing completion; the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail which was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began.\n\nOthers are the Abuja Light Rail, which was completed in 2018; the ground-breaking for construction of Kano-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail, and revamp of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow Gauge Rail.\n\nIt also listed ongoing financing negotiations for Ibadan-Kano Standard Gauge Rail project.\n\nOn road projects, the statement listed the PIDF, the investment of over a billion dollars on three flagship projects: Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano expressway.\n\nOther efforts in this regards included the Executive Order 7 to mobilise private investment into the development of key roads and bridges like Bodo-Bonny in Rivers and Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota in Lagos.\n\nThe Buhari administration, according to the statement, has done well in boosting the capacity of the nation\u2019s ports.\n\nAdesina cited such efforts as the completion of new terminals for International Airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt; Construction of New Runway for Abuja and Enugu International Airports and the Presidential approval for four International Airports at Special Economic Zones: Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt.\n\nOthers include, the approval for new private-sector funded deep sea ports: Lekki Deep Sea Port (construction already well underway, for completion in 2022); Bonny Deep Sea Port (ground-breaking done in March 2021); Ibom Deep Sea Port; and Warri Deep Sea Port. The list includes the development of capacity at the Eastern Ports.\n\nIn the power sector, Adesina listed President Buhari\u2019s effort to include the implementation of Energising Education Programme, which involves taking clean and reliable energy (Solar and Gas) to Federal Universities and Teaching Hospitals across the country. Projects in four Universities have been completed and commissioned: BUK (Kano), FUNAI (Ebonyi), ATBU (Bauchi) and FUPRE (Delta). Others are ongoing.\n\nHe listed another achievement to include the National Mass Metering Programme, which involves the nationwide rollout of electricity meters to all on-grid consumers, launched in August 2020.\n\nListed as achievements were the ground-breaking on 614km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Project, successful completion of Nigeria\u2019s first Marginal Field Bid Round in almost 20 years, expected to raise in excess of half a billion dollars.\n\nThe achievements also included the Policy, Regulatory and Funding Support for the establishment of Modular Refineries across the Niger Delta.\n\nOn agriculture, the administration maintained that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion loans to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish), cultivating over 3.8 million hectares of farmland.\n\nIt noted that the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has helped anti-corruption agencies devise clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been acquired fraudulently, mainly from State coffers, before prosecuting suspected culprits.\n\nThe Presidency noted that the administration had been able to secure billions of dollars in concessional infrastructure funding for critical road and rail projects. It noted, for instance, that President Buhari\u2019s April 2016 official visit to China has unlocked billions of dollars in infrastructure funding, primarily for road, rail and port projects, as well as the implementation of a Chinese Yuan (CNY) 15 billion Currency Swap Agreement between the Peoples Bank of China and the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nIt noted that the administration had been able to secure international recognition within the period of six years and this include the designation of President Buhari as the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion for 2018, and by ECOWAS Heads of State as West Africa\u2019s COVID-19 Champion in 2020.\n\nIt also listed the appointments of eminent Nigerians into international posts. These include, Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), appointed 2017;\u2019 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) (first African and first woman to hold the position, elected 2021; Akin Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, elected in 2015 and re-elected 2020;; Benedict Oramah, President of African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), re-elected for a second term in 2020; and \u2013 Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); elected 2016, re-elected 2019, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned President Buhari to use the May 29 speech to accept his lapses in his administration and avoid exasperating Nigerians with his usual prepared text of false performance-claims and empty promises.\n\nIn a statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said the President and the All Progressives Congress (APC) \u201cmust know that Nigerians are no longer interested in their stage-managed Presidential addresses, as well as the circus show of their so-called APC Legacy Awareness Campaign, particularly in the face of the horrendous situation they have plunged the nation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says he was selected based on national interest, not on ethnic, religious sentiments\n\n\u2022New COAS resumes, Irabor charges him to build on Attahiru\u2019s legacy\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nweze in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday defended its choice of Major General Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), while also revealing plans to immortalise the former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and others that perished in a plane crash about a week ago in Kaduna State.\n\nDefending its choice, the government insisted that contrary to public opinion, the appointment of Yahaya, who resumed duty yesterday, was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash on Friday, May 21.\n\nThe appointment of the new COAS on Thursday had elicited fierce criticisms from a wide spectrum of Nigerians who alleged that other more qualified senior army generals were denied the position because they hailed from the south-eastern part of the country.\n\nCritics also argued that the office of Army Chief had been restricted to Northerners in the six years Buhari has spent so far as President and that the President ought to have shifted a bit by picking the new Army Chief from among Southern Generals in the Army, so as to give the rest of the country a sense of belonging.\n\nApparently reacting to the criticisms yesterday, the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi said the appointment of Yahaya was strategic and was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nThe Minister, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mohammad Abdulkadri, described the new Army Chief as \u201can organic infantry general who is tested and trusted to actualise the national aspirations to restore peace in the dark spots and areas of insurgency, kidnapping, and banditry, as well as other allied threats to the nation\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nMagashi commended President Buhari \u201cfor the well thought-out strategic appointment of Yahaya as a replacement for the late Attahiru.\n\n\u201cWith the appointment of General Yahaya, President Buhari has expediently put national interest above ethnic and religious chauvinism by fulfilling all requirements necessary. These include his unblemished track records of service, professional, command, and operational competencies among other yardsticks that culminated into his emergence as most suitably qualified new Army boss.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Minister expressed optimism in the professional pedigree of General Yahaya, the former theatre Commander Operation \u201cHadin Kai\u201d, in sustaining the trajectory of taking offensive and aggressive campaigns to the camps, corridors, and cells of the adversaries to obliterate them.\n\nWhile pledging the support of the Ministry of Defence under his watch to the new Army boss in carrying out his mandate, the minister said plans were in the pipeline by the federal government to immortalise the late General Attahiru and others who died in the plane crash.\n\nYahaya is from Sokoto State and he was a member of the 37th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy.\n\nThe choice of Yahaya, according to independent analysis, means Nigeria would lose heavy investments made on about 60 army generals from the Army Regular Courses 35 and 36, who, by army tradition, have to proceed on summary retirement as a result of the choice of the new COAS, who belongs to the course 37 set.\n\nYahaya Resumes\n\nMeanwhile, General Yahaya formally resumed duty as the nation\u2019s Chief of Army Staff yesterday.\n\nHe took over during a ceremony held at the Army Headquarters in Abuja, where on arrival, he inspected a guard of honour at the sentry, thereafter, he proceeded to the conference room.\n\nBefore the commencement of the programme, he led others to observe a minute silence in honour of his late predecessor and 10 others, who died in the plane crash.\n\nA statement by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff was received at the Army Headquarters by the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP) Army, Maj Gen BI Ahanotu and thereafter inspected a quarter guards mounted in his honour and the symbolic lowering and hoisting of command flag to signify the end and beginning of a new command in line with army traditions.\n\n\u201cGeneral Yahaya later held a brief meeting with principal staff officers after observing a minute silence in honour of former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 others. He requested maximum cooperation of the senior officers in order to achieve the mandate of safeguarding the country from the multifaceted security challenges facing the country\u201d, the statement said.\n\nThe COAS further stressed \u201cteam work and synergy as the way forward for the Nigerian Army and the nation as no single individual or agency can make it alone\u201d.\n\nBuild on the Legacy of Attahiru, Irabor Charges New Army Chief\n\nMaking a point of what he expects, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, yesterday charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, describing his appointment as well-deserved.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Acting Director Defence Information, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, Irabor gave the charge when he hosted the new COAS at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Abuja on resumption of duty.\n\n\u201cI urge you to build on the legacy of your predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and armed banditry,\u201d declared the CDS.\n\nThe statement from the DHQ continues: \u201cThe CDS also wished him a successful tenure in office as he assumes command. General Irabor further urged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and banditry.\u201d The COAS was accompanied on the visit by the Chief of Policy and Plans Headquarters Nigerian Army, Maj Gen Benjamin Ahanotu.\n\nHighlight of the visit was the presentation of Nigerian Army flag to the new COAS by the CDS, Brigadier General Nwachukwu said in the statement.\n\nPresident Buhari appointed Gen.

          "text": "Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the appeal of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the alleged certificate forgery against Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe APC and one of its chieftains, Williams Edobor, had appealed the judgment of the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal, which had dismissed their case of certificate forgery against Obaseki on the grounds that the allegations were not proved.\n\nHowever delivering judgment in the appeal, the apex court just like the appellate and trial courts held that the appellants failed woefully in their case having not provided any disclaimer from the school that the said result was not issued by it.\n\nThe apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, also agreed with the lower courts that the appellants did not meet sufficient requirement of the law in proving their allegations.\n\nThe court accordingly upheld two judgments of the Court of Appeal Abuja and the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier dismissed the case of the appellants for lacking in merit.\n\nThe court in addition awarded a cost of N1 million in favour of Obaseki.\n\nReacting to the judgment, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) hailed the judgement of the Supreme Court which upheld the election of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, describing it as the inevitable triumph of the will of the people over anti-democratic forces.\n\nAlso, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, described the Nigeria Judiciary as the referee of Nigeria\u2019s democracy through enforcement of the rule of law, to protect the minorities from the power of the majority, despite their attempts to tilt the playing field against the rules.\n\nThe Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had on March 18, dismissed the appeal of the APC seeking to upturn the judgment of Justice Ahmed Mohammed of a Federal High Court, Abuja which dismissed the case of the plaintiff on grounds of abundant evidence that the certificates Obaseki tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were genuine and issued by relevant authorities.\n\nAPC in the suit was seeking the sack of Obaseki as governor on grounds that he forged documents he submitted to INEC in aid of his qualification for the 2020 governorship election in Edo State.\n\nThe 3-man panel did not only dismiss the appeal of the APC for being incompetent and lacking in merit but went ahead to award the sum of N250, 000 as cost in favour of Obaseki.\n\nJustice Stephen Adah had in the judgment held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusion in the APC suit.\n\nThe appellate court also upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, Mr. Abayomi Ajayi who confirmed that Obaseki attended University of Ibadan in 1976 and fulfilled the requirement for admission into the institution.\n\nAdah added that the evidence of the Deputy Registrar was direct in showing that Obaseki did not forge his University of Ibadan certificate submitted to INEC and as such fulfilled all requirements to contest for the governorship position of Edo State.\n\nThe trial court had on January 9 this year dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Obaseki, on grounds that the party failed to substantiate its claim of forgery.\n\nBut not satisfied APC approached the Appeal Court to challenge the judgment of the lower court.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the verdict of the apex court in throwing out the petition of APC was a resounding reinforcement of the popularity of the PDP and Governor Obaseki in Edo State, as firmly established in the election.\n\nThe party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Governor Obaseki to continue in his commitment towards the development of the state and the well-being of his people in line with the manifesto and ideology of the PDP; the very reason he was overwhelmingly re-elected as governor of the state.\n\nThe PDP said that it was proud of Governor Obaseki for the empowerment of the people as well as massive infrastructural development of Edo State in critical areas of healthcare, education, agriculture and food production, oil and gas, industrialisation among others.\n\nThe party also commended the judiciary for its courage in upholding justice and the will of the people in the Edo governorship election.\n\nShaibu while reacting said, \u201cThe ruling of the Supreme Court today has shown that the judiciary does not lack teeth. The rule of law is the strong pillar and rock on which Nigeria\u2019s democracy stands. Every other foundation is made of sinking sand because the judiciary is no longer bound by artificial limitations.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary constitutes the most important vessel in the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria, even as he reminded politicians that the Supreme Court is not a systematic instrument for the acquisition of political power.\n\n\u201cThe final judgement today has demonstrated to the World that the Nigerian Judiciary is not a pawn in the hands of desperate politicians to realise their ambition. The rule of law has prevailed and this has demonstrated further that no one can sit above the law. Justice is the greatest interest of man and the ligament which binds civilised people together. Today\u2019s judgement has reinforced this saying due to the celebration all over Edo State and other parts of the World.\n\n\u201cThe extent to which the Nigeria Judiciary is free to perform it\u2019s roles and efficiently too, will determine how developed and how deep rooted our Democracy will be.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nokia X20 Review \u2013 Dualsight Camera, 2-day battery life, and more",
          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",
          "summary": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country.\nIt has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects.\nBut the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook.\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria.\nKaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "Care homes for the elderly present untapped investment opportunities",
          "text": "For investors seeking green fields that harbour opportunity for good yields, retirement and care homes offer such opportunity and it is largely untapped in Nigeria, according to a new report.\n\nThe opportunity in this market arises mainly from the lack of functional national policy on the care and welfare of older persons in Nigeria. Also, changing demographics in the country coupled with the breakdown in family structure and absence of a social security system, present unique challenges to the elderly in Nigeria.\n\nThis means an investment opportunity for investors ready to deliver fit-for-purpose homes and other facilities that will address the current challenges that the aged community in the country faces.\n\n\u201cThere is a general lack of adequate enclosed retirement communities for the elderly. Opportunities in the retirement/care homes which are largely untapped also arise from the 2014 reform in the Pension Fund Administration (PFA) scheme.\n\n\u201cThis scheme guarantees stable retirement income for the elderly and provides the necessary cash flow to fund this lifestyle,\u201d Olumide Osundolire, Partner at Banwo & Ighodalo, confirmed.\n\nRead Also: Economy still awaits FG\u2019s 300k-unit housing intervention 12months after\n\nIn the report, \u2018New Investment Opportunities\u2019 Osundolire listed three basic types of retirement/care homes, each depending on the range of its services. They include independent living apartments; nursing homes and home health care. The first type is the current destination for investors with its encouraging return on investment.\n\nThough Nigeria\u2019s population aged 65 years and above fluctuated substantially in recent years, it tended to decrease through the 1971 \u2013 2020 period, ending at 2.7 percent in 2020 which is about 5.4 million.\n\nWith the largest population in Africa, estimated at 200 million, Nigeria has an elderly projected population growth rate of 3.2 percent and this rate has been estimated to double by 2050.\n\nThe implication of this is that the size and value of this market are encouraging enough for investors to go for the opportunities which will be increasing as years pass by.\n\nBut investment considerations here should favour facilities and amenities that enhance the lifestyle of the middle-class retirees from 60 years and above. Again, the gated communities are developed with a needs-driven approach to meet the lifestyle needs of the residents from housing design, shopping, exercise and fitness, mobility, health home services, entertainment and community activities.\n\nThe expectation is that opportunities here are to be nurtured by a significant rise in the population of the aged going forward. Osundolire noted that the ageing population is a global trend, quoting a UN report which estimates the world percentage of persons over 60 years old at 13 percent.\n\n\u201cSub-Saharan Africa, which has the smallest proportion of elderly and which is ageing slower than the developed regions is projected to see the absolute size of its older population grow by 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2030,\u201d he said.\n\nTokunbo Ajayi, CEO, Propertygate Development and Investment Company, affirmed that opportunities exist in this market and residential developments generally, pointing out, however, that much of the opportunities in residential real estate are in small-size residential family units.\n\n\u201cThe reason developers and investors opt for these small-size units such as one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments is that luxury housing units hardly find buyers as they are no longer in high demand.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that even with the switch to smaller family units, developers\u2019 challenges remain as funding is not coming easily from traditional lenders such as banks.\n\nJide Odusolu, CEO, Octo5 Real Estate, shares this view, stressing that since the pandemic, banks do not fund real estate development, noting that very few of them invest or support the middle market, which is the source of the bulk of true demand.\n\n\u201cTo further complicate the situation, agencies such as Family Homes Funds (FHF) and Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Corporation (NMRC), which are trying to avoid the mistakes of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and fund real demand, are hampered by inadequate supply, which is the proverbial chicken and egg situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, there are better opportunities now for demand-side support, but very little support for the supply-side, lamenting that government institutions erroneously assume that most developers are fronts, which is not true and rather than provide support, end up choking the industry.\n\nTo remain afloat, he said, many developers now rely heavily on syndicated private bonds to source take-off capital and thereafter bundle their off-take to mortgage facilitation entities.",

          "title": "Customer loyalty in the shadows of scepticism",
          "text": "An average customer is a sceptic, and that should not be surprising because people are constrained to be careful. They have been lied to by almost everyone\u2015government, politicians, service providers, marketers, manufacturers, etc. They are constantly bombarded by companies trying to grab their money and when they contact a company with an issue, they often have to battle to get the company to make it right.\n\nEven companies that claim to be customer-obsessed usually think of customer obsession only in terms of how it can maximize Return On Investment (ROI) and increase the bottom line. It is more of an obsession with the customers\u2019 wallets than the customers themselves.\n\nThe problem with customer satisfaction\n\nTo maximize their share of customers\u2019 wallets, most brands spend large\u2014if not the largest\u2014portion of their data collection budget on monitoring customer satisfaction. They attempt to use these measures to outpace their competition and get their customers to spend more. They rarely care about making the customer experience the best it can be. Instead, they only concern themselves with being a bit better than the competition, so that the customer is more likely to spend money at the \u2018better\u2019 experience.\n\nAnd, this is where the problem of customer satisfaction metrics lies. This is a relative measure; it does not reflect how well a company is creating the experience a customer really wants. Customer satisfaction measures what researchers call \u2018The Expectancy-Disconfirmation Paradigm (EDP)\u2019. Customer satisfaction is an evaluation of how well something performs relative to how the customer thinks it will perform. This is why focusing on customer satisfaction can be dangerous. Satisfaction is only relative to past experiences with your business and similar companies\u2014who are also likely only doing an objectively average job at it.\n\nCustomers and companies are usually in broken relationships\n\nThis desire to treat customers as an object whose resources are to be maximally mined has also led most companies to spend more time and resources in acquiring new customers instead of taking care of existing customers.\n\nRead Also: Relationship Marketing: Key to Brand Loyalty\n\nJust look at the number of companies offering great incentives to new customers but offering little or no appreciation to customers that have been with them for years, and it becomes obvious how little effort is put into maintaining relationships. Customers end up being treated like numbers instead of people.\n\nThis is no different from what erodes personal relationships. The main reasons relationships go south are selfishness, narcissism, a lack of balance, the relationship not being a priority, and issues of trust. When customer relationships are treated as one-sided\u2014when there isn\u2019t an effort to try and benefit the customer at least as much as the company benefits from the customer\u2014there\u2019s no reason for customers to view a company with anything but scepticism and a lack of trust. You can\u2019t build loyalty without trust. Yet, many companies start to try and build \u2018loyalty programmes\u2019 without fixing the broken relationships and building trust.\n\nThe problem with loyalty programmes\n\nMost loyalty programmes aren\u2019t truly about loyalty. They\u2019re based on an outdated idea of loyalty that focuses solely on behavioural loyalty. Currently, loyalty research has gone beyond thinking of loyalty in this one-dimensional way and instead conceives of loyalty as encompassing attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions.4\n\nIn other words, loyalty isn\u2019t just how people behave towards a brand, it\u2019s also about how they think and feel about it.\n\nA customer can be loyal from a perspective of behaviour because they currently see no other option\u2014the same reason they may say they\u2019re satisfied\u2014but are quick to switch if someone meets their deeper human needs better. Instead of trying to build great relationships by understanding what motivates customers to do business with them at a deep, human level and then doing more and more of that to build trust and ultimately create loyalty, most companies skip these attitudinal and cognitive dimensions of loyalty and focus solely on programmes to encourage behaviour.\n\nCompanies reward their customers in the same monetary and monotonous ways, instead of doing what they should be doing: rewarding the best customers in ways that reflect why they love the brand in the first place. But, that requires deeply listening to customers. And, when companies act like narcissists for their own benefits, it becomes hard to listen. These companies are essentially trying to trap their customers in bad relationships.\n\nFinding true loyalty\n\nLoyalty begins with trust and trust doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nTrust is built up over time by customers seeing that you have their best interests in mind over and over again. They don\u2019t mind that you have your own interests\u2014just like in any relationship\u2014but they want to see that you care about them in an equal way.\n\nLoyalty happens when they develop cognitive and emotional attachments to a business as a result of trust being built up over time. These cognitive and emotional attachments reinforce their behaviours and get them to both think of you first and purchase from you frequently.\n\nLast line: Loyalty requires being proactive instead of reactive. It\u2019s not about being slightly better than the competition or waiting until enough customers complain before you fix it. It is about understanding your customers\u2019 tensions and desires better than they do and constantly trying to push further towards those ideals. These start with deeply listening to and understanding your customers and caring about their needs as much as you do your own.",

I see this victory as a renewed call by God Almighty to rededicate myself to His service and that of the people of Edo state.\n\n\u201cFrom the statement by the Supreme Court Justices, it is clear that they align with what Edo people knew all along, which is that there was no merit in the case. The controversy was diabolical and ill-willed. It is reassuring that the Judiciary has upheld the wishes of the masses once again.\u201d\n\nObaseki dedicated the victory to Edo people, noting that their resolve to stand by him despite the campaign of calumny was inspiring.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for supporting him and holding steadfast in his belief and vision for a better Edo.\n\nThe governor also hailed His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), for ensuring that the judiciary remained impartial.\n\nRecall that the Federal High Court, Abuja, had on January 9 dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Governor Obaseki.\n\nThe judge, Ahmed Mohammed, had described the APC\u2019s allegation as strange, saying it was like an outsider telling a man in his house that he is not the father of a child.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, the APC approached the appellate court to challenge the judgment.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal had in a judgement, on March 18, held that the case the APC brought to vacate the January 9 verdict of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which authenticated Obaseki\u2019s University of Ibadan degree certificate, lacked merit.\n\nThe appellate court panel which was led by Justice Stephen Adah, upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, University of Ibadan, Abayomi Ajayi, who had earlier confirmed before the trial court, that Obaseki attended the University and fulfilled all the requirements for admission into the department of Classical Studies.\n\nDelivering judgment in the appeal, the judge held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusions.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has encouraged all patriotic Igbo people across the globe to observe the May 30 Biafra Remembrance Day, as according to it, the day remained an important part of the history of Igbo nation.\n\nThe ADF which made call in a statement signed by its president, Professor Uzodinma Nwala and spokesperson, Chief Abia Onyike on Friday, argued that May 30 has become an official Igbo Remembrance Day, which cannot be wished away.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra had called for a candlelight procession on May 30 and sit-at-home on May 31 in honour of those killed during the Biafra war.\n\nHowever, opposing the call, the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, yesterday asked residents to go about their activities without fear.\n\nThe governor said his administration said had finalised arrangements with security operatives to contain any eventuality\n\nBut throwing its weight behind the decision the May 30 commemoration, ADF maintained that the event is deeply rooted in the heart of Igbo people and which nobody can wish it away or ban it by force of Law or prevent it by force of arms.\n\n\u201cEvents in Alaigbo on May 30, each year show that May 30 has become an official Igbo Remembrance Day not only within Alaigbo but throughout the entire world where Igbo citizens live. Each year from London to Johannesburg, to several cities in Europe, Asia, America and Canada, the story is the same with various activities organized by Umuigbo and their friends to mark the occasion,\u201d ADF said in the statement.\n\n\u201cBack home the entire Alaigbo have often been shut down; markets, shops, schools and offices closed while streets are deserted to mark the Remembrance Day.\n\n\u2018The Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) is fully aware that May 30 is a day in the history of Alaigbo, deeply rooted in the heart of our people and which nobody can wish away or ban by force of Law or prevent by force of arms.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of this that the ADF fully supports observance of May 30, this year as Igbo Day Celebration. We urge all Igbo patriots to celebrate this year\u2019s event on Sunday, 30th May, 2021. Let Ndigbo celebrate it as a solemn occasion by going to Church, wearing of black bands and fasting including peaceful activities lined out for the day by different Igbo organizations.\u201d\n\nThe ADF said May 30 is day the defunct Biafra Republic was declared, and no conscious Igbo person would deny that Biafra is part of their history.\n\n\u201cMay 30 marks the day Biafra was declared in 1967 and no patriotic Igbo son or daughter can pretend that Biafra is not part of the history and indeed the major water-shed in the history of the Igbo nation,\u201d the group noted.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is in doubt let him recall what has often happened on May 30, especially in 2017 and 2018 when our sons and daughters under the aegis of IPOB, MASSOB and other Pan-Igbo organizations declared a SIT-AT-HOME to commemorate Biafra Day as a historic day in the life of Ndigbo, while other forms of memorial activities take place to mark the historic day.\n\n\u201cThe total compliance of that call throughout the length and breadth of Alaigbo was not because these pan-Igbo and pro-Biafra organizations had become their supreme authority. No! That call evokes intense yearning in the innermost recesses of the hearts and minds of Umuigbo.\n\n\u201cConsequently, whosoever provoked the observance is welcome as a lover of the Igbo nation. BIAFRA evokes intense longing for freedom for our people. Biafra is indeed more than a state of the mind. It is also a material force that moves our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, Biafra has remained in the mind of Igbo people because it symbolizes their longing for freedom.\n\n\u201cWhy will Biafra not symbolize their longing for freedom, when their predicament since the Amalgamation in 1914 up to the Biafra Declaration on My 30, 1967 and ever since Biafra has been a continuous state of estrangement, brutal attacks and punitive measures against their spiritual, economic, political and physical survival?\n\n\u201cThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), therefore, proposes that Umuigbo should turn May 30 every year to be observed as a REMEMBRANCE DAY \u2013 a day to remember our history, to review our successes and failures, to remember those who have died fighting for the Igbo cause and also think of our future,\u201d the statement concluded.",

          "title": "Any PDP tour of Osun without resolution chairmanship tussle a waste of time \u2013 Adagunodo",
          "text": "The embattled chairman of Osun State Chapter of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Hon. Soji Adagunodo recently met with some selected journalist where he bare his mind on some sundry issues. SUNDAY OGUNTUYI was there.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since an Appeal Court sitting in Akure decided that you are no longer the Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of PDP\u2026?\n\nNo! no!! no!!! The Appeal Court never ruled that I am no longer the Chairman. Go and read the judgment very well. It did not say that. There was a prayer by the appellants to the court that the November 3, 2020 High Court Ikirun Division Interim/Interlocutory Order be vacated which was granted. Meanwhile my Chairmanship position that hinges on November a 9, 2020 Preservative Order was not appealed against, which means it still subsists. The Court of Appeal ruled that the substantive case be determined at the lower court.\n\nMind you, there is nowhere in the judgment where Sunday Bisi was pronounced Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Go and get a copy of the judgment and read it very well. I\u2019m waiting for the resumption of the courts to straighten this out.\n\nOkay, what are your prayers before the court?\n\nMy prayer is that my removal is illegal, null and void, based on the 2017 Constitution of our party as amended, which incidentally was signed into law by both the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus and the National Secretary of the Party, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri. Section 2 of our Party Constitution is very clear on its supremacy, so I am praying the Court to reaffirm me as the rightful chairman, with all privileges to function and serve out my tenure, without hindrance.\n\nIncreasingly, party members are articulating that you should settle out of court. How are you going to pursue the next phase of the court case against PDP on your removal?\n\nOn the two occasions that the High Court, Ikirun Division gave an Interim order on the 3rd and 9th of November last year, I called for political solution, but those that do not have the interest of the party at heart did not allow those, who are supposedly, concerned to listen. What I believe is that there are certain elements that are feeding party members with fabricated lies, to actualize their illegal position, but by God\u2019s grace the case will reopen when the courts resume sitting. I will exploit and execute every known legal means available to clear my name and pursue same to a logical conclusion.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the party crisis and what is the way forward since some observers of the happenings in the party believe that the solution lies with your reinstatement?\n\nFor peace to reign in any society, which our party belongs, there must be justice. My removal from office illegal, it is injustice of the highest order and quite unexpected from a party I hold so dear. Suffice it to say, that political parties aggregate the destiny of citizens in trust and, therefore, should be seen to obey its own laws and constitution. That is what gives the populace the confidence to cast their votes, in trust for the party to take charge of their affairs and destiny as a people and without fear of being manipulated as being presently experienced by APC, especially at the Federal level.\n\nAre you aware of a proposed tour of the state by the Sunday Bisi led Working Committee beginning from June 1, 2021? If yes, what does this mean to you?\n\nI am aware that a group of people in the party, otherwise known as the Ademola Adeleke group, codenamed The Pathfinder Team, proposed that and also made a release about the tour which clearly indicates that it is not a party programme but a group\u2019s programme. That\u2019s what our party has been turned into.\n\nIt is not an official programme of the Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Interest groups within a political party are allowed to consult but this should not be misconstrued as an official programme of Osun PDP. No, it is not. It is a group of supporters that want to do that for their preferred aspirant. There is a difference between OSUN PDP AND PATHFINDER TEAM. Many of such will still take place.\n\nAs for the party, when it is ready to move and consult with members of the party and the good people of Osun State, you will see the who-is-who that will be involved. There\u2019s no way the party will consult round the state, whether with members and or the public, without me as the party chairman being involved.\n\nOur party will never embark on state wide consultations without our revered leaders like Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola; Alhaji Shuaib Oyedokun; Dr. Olu Alabi; High Chief Dele Faseru; HE, Erelu Obada, CON; Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi; Chief Segun Odekunmi; Our National Ex-Officio, Hon. Paul Olakunle; Chief Olaoye Oyelayo; Alhaji Sule Oyedeji; Aremo Kunle Alao; Engr. Jide Adeniji; Barrister Kayode Oduoye; Dr. Oluomo Daisi Aina; Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, CON; Hon. Busayo Oluwole Oke; Hon. Taofeek Abimbola Ajilesiro; the Southwest Zonal Officers; Members of the State House of Osun State House of Assembly who are members of the party and many other leaders across the state that are too numerous to mention. So any arrangement or movement that does not have the inclusion of these people, to me, is a mere jamboree that we should discountenance\n\nIn addition, even in the so called Adeleke Group, the few that are planning the movement are in their minority. Others in the same group are still eagerly waiting for the court pronouncement on our case because they don\u2019t want to be caught in the web. More importantly, there is no serious minded group that will be planning a tour on behalf of an aspirant without the aspirant being physically present to meet the people. Are they going to be consulting for him by proxy?\n\nWill you consider your removal as the genesis of the Osun PDP crisis?\n\nSee, our endless journey in the wonderland of political quandary and party leadership quagmire is due to one reason: TRUTH. The same truth we all love to hate. My removal was premeditated and hatched by some Fifth Columnists within our party, who fed Dr Deji Adeleke with many lies about me. I have, on several occasions, explained to him through personal contacts and letters to clear myself of the many falsehoods and allegations they raised against me. You see, isn\u2019t it funny that I was accused of anti-party activities when, as a matter of fact, I delivered my unit, ward, state and federal constituencies in all elections? I also delivered my senatorial and Governorship votes during elections just as I did in respect of the Presidential Election for the Party\u2019s candidate. Now tell me how they want to justify my loyalty to the party and her candidates in those elections? I did everything humanly possible for the success of the Party even to the extent of putting my life on the line .Those feeding fat from the crisis are the ones who want to subjugate the supremacy of the party and our collective will, with intent to disallow free, fair and credible internal democratic processes under me, to elect the party flag bearer for Osun 2022. They prefer to select, rather than elect, a candidate so that they too can enjoy the same selection because many of them have ambition and they know they can never emerge as candidates of the party in their various domains and constituencies. Funny enough they all lost in all past and previous elections except for a few of them.\n\nWho are those few?\n\nThe few ones know themselves and those who lost, who have been serial losers, also know themselves. They are many that do not have records of electoral success or victory for themselves or for the party from time immemorial. They are now the ones in charge that want to control the party machinery at all cost, for the sake of their selfish interest , pecuniary gains and personal political ambition.\n\nBarring all obstacles, if you\u2019re back in office fully today, what will you do as the Party Chairman to chart a new course for the party?\n\nI\u2019ll renew and increase my efforts that was deployed in 2017 and which gave us the needed maximum victory in 9 out of 10 local government areas during the Osun West Senatorial bye-election. In 2018 same efforts gave us another victory at first ballot despite the fact that manipulators crept in and destroyed the lofty relationship between the party leadership and the family of our candidate. I will also ensure that we evolve new strategies to bring in more disenfranchised members. Some have distanced themselves from the party due to the lingering crises. I will bring them back in order to strengthen the party. As it is today, the advantage of the impeding implosion in APC will be fully utilized to bring PDP back to governance in Osun State in 2022.\n\nIt is everywhere that Dr Deji Adeleke solely sponsored the Congress leading to your emergence as Chairman. How true is that?\n\nNo, It\u2019s a lie. The Adelekes participated in only 1 out of the 4 congresses that we had. I appreciate Dr Deji Adeleke\u2019s contributions. Anything, or every money, he spent was after the Party had successfully installed his brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as Senator. They were the first, and the highest, beneficiary of our struggle. Please, don\u2019t forget that we had two formidable, qualified and acceptable Senatorial candidates, Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi and Col. Olayiwola Falabi, before the leadership of the Party directed them to withdraw for Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nOn the Governorship primaries, Osun PDP had many aspirants before the Adelekes joined our Party, only Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi and Adeleke came into the Party later and almost at the same time. There were aspirants before them, like Rt. Hon. Rafiu Adejare Bello (now in APC); Akogun Lere Oyewumi; Dr Kayode Oduoye; Senator Kola Ogunwale; Dr Ayoade Adewopo; Senator Olasunkanmi Akinlabi; Oluomo Gbenga Owolabi; Barrister N.O.O. Oke (SAN); Alhaji Fatai Akinbade and others. All these gentlemen stood with the Party. They all did everything possible to reshape and reposition the party. And they did not cry about their lofty efforts like what we are witnessing from the greatest beneficiary of our struggle when they lost the bid to emerge as the Party\u2019s candidate.\n\nFor record purposes Hon Oluwole Oke; Baba Shuaib Oyedokun; the National Secretary of our party at that time, Prof. Wale Oladipo; Sen (Dr) Olu Alabi; Erelu Olusola Obada CON; at a later date Senator Francis Fadahunsi, CON; and Rt. Hon. Albert Adeogun with the aforementioned foremost aspirants and Dr Akin Ogunbiyi also contributed immensely to the struggle, not to mention my personal involvements and contributions.\n\nOne of the allegations against you is that you were involved in anti-party activities?\n\nIt\u2019s laughable and insulting. I am a founding member of the party. I can never be involved in anti-party activities against the PDP. The party is in my blood. No matter what happens, I see PDP as my investment. I won my Unit with over 300 votes , my ward with over 1000 votes, an uncommon occurrence in the state. I won my Ward, Local Government, Federal Constituency and Senatorial district, Governorship and presidential elections as I said earlier. So where does the issue of anti-party activity come in?\n\nDuring the 2018 Governorship election, I was in my ward when I received security information that APC was trying to rig the election in Ward 4 and Ward 5 in Osogbo local government and no single leader was responding to their distress calls from Osogbo. Immediately I got that message, I left my unit in Obokun Local Government and joined our people in Osogbo to prevent the rigging and it was God that saved my life. I was attacked by APC two times that night during that election. I almost lost my life. All active members in Osogbo local government reading this interview will bear me witness. Is it possible for APC to attack someone that was working for them? I didn\u2019t engage in anti-party activities and I can never be. I will never do that against my beloved PDP as long as I remain a member.\n\nCan you confirm to us when the next Ward and Local government congresses of your party will be taking place? We heard it\u2019s October this year.\n\nThat cannot be correct. It is a misinformation. The congresses will come up anytime from March next year according to the term and years of office. If you remember, the resolution reached by the present National Working Committee of our party under Prince Uche Secondus in Abuja sometimes around February 2018 was that we should go and conduct a fresh congress from Ward to State when the attempt to install Dr. Bayo Faforiji by the Omisore group failed. They had complained that the existing Partial Ward congress conducted in October 2017 favoured me and that it was going to be an easy win for me. Despite that, we went to Ejigbo High Court and there was a judgment that was delivered on March 22. We got clearance from Abuja to go ahead with the congress in compliance with the court judgment. The fourth and last congresses that ushered us in took place on March 23, 24 and 25, 2018. Therefore, the four year tenure will lapse on those dates in 2022.\n\nAs at today, how many gubernatorial aspirants have declared their intention to contest the gubernatorial ticket of the party?\n\nThe fortune of the party depends on the ongoing leadership tussle in the court of law, Osun PDP is blessed with personalities who are well equipped in providing lasting solutions to the plight of the people. We have a few who have expressed their wish to run, but no candidate can emerge without a valid Party leadership and primaries. You can\u2019t build something on nothing. I know immediately the leadership crises is over we will have qualified and competent aspirants from our party that will become our candidate.\n\nOn a final note, what are your party\u2019s chances in 2022?\n\nThe chances of any political party to win elections depend on its stability, capacity and capability to handle internal criss that are always inevitable. Any political party that cannot handle its own internal crisis as a family affair is heading for destruction.\n\nAs it is today, I pray that our leaders at both state and national levels will quickly rise to the occasion to resolve all internal crisis within the party. To be specific, the victory or success of Osun State Chapter of PDP in 2022 is very central to the party winning the national elections in 2023, hence the need to resolve the crises in Osun state chapter as soon as possible, so that we can win 2022 Gubernatorial Election which will definitely have multiplier effects on other national elections that will follow, including the Presidential election.",

          "text": "Former President General of apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, John Nnia Nwodo, yesterday, called for the creation of Adada State in the South East.\n\nNwodo drew the attention of the constitution review committee to the age long demand for the creation of Adada State while presenting the memorandum during zonal public hearing of the senate committee on the review of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. According to Nwodo, the South East has long been marginalized in the distribution of state entities and as such, the creation of an additional state would help give the people a sense of belonging.\n\nHe noted that the demand for the creation of Adada State has come a long way, recalling how legislators in the South East met in 2006 in Imo State where they threw their weight behind the need for the creation of an additional state to be known as Adada. \u201cNo demand is as old as the demand for an additional creation of an additional state for the people and this shows it can be recommended\u201d he said.\n\nHe further noted that the demand for an additional state creation is unique in many respects because members of the federal and state houses of assembly, chairmen of local governments and other citizens signed and gave their support. He recalled that former president Goodluck Jonathan convened a national conference in 2014 where the need for additional state creation and other recommendations were made.\n\nHe regretted that till now, the recommendations have not been considered for implementation. \u201cIf the recommendations that were given during that conference were adopted, we would not have gathered here today\u201d he said, adding that the time has come for Nigeria to be restructured in order to deal with the demands of all sections in the country. Responding, Sen Ike Ekweremadu, who is the chairman, Senate Committee on constitutional review, said that no other state in the South East had made a request for the creation of another state and that shows that the demand for Adada State is the collective resolve of all citizens in the zone.\n\nHe noted that although those who made the constitution made it almost impossible for the creation of an additional state, it can still be achieved. \u201cIt is happening at a time when I have the freedom to openly support the request and it is good that we are deciding to pursue the cause for the creation of Adada State.\n\nTogether, we can get it done. It is not going to be by force\u201d he said. In addition to the demand for the creation of an additional state in the South East, there was the demand by various groups for the decentralization of the police to allow states to have control of their security in order to end rising insecurity in the country.\n\nThere was also the demand for the reflection of the roles of traditional rulers in the constitution given the roles they play at the grassroots level as well as the need for the inclusion of the affairs of persons living with disability in the Nigeria constitution. One of the traditional rulers who spoke to newsmen, requested the creation of a fourth tier of government that will ensure the proper harnessing of potentials at the grassroots.

In a multi-ethnic society like this, he has to consider sensitivity, sensibility and diversity.\n\n\u201cIn summary, Mr president has two years to stay, and he has not proven himself to be a nationalistic leader but a sectional leader, an ethnic warlord and a nepotic leader.\n\n\u201cIn the history of Nigeria, it will be on record that one General Buhari came, and instead of building a united nation, he was building a divided one.\u201d",

The pandemic is threatening decades of progress we have made for children.\n\n\u201cViolence is perpetrated against one in four Nigerian children \u2013 and one in three Nigerian girls is sexually abused. This has only increased during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cToday of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\n\n\u201cBut we have learned from this pandemic too. One thing we have learned is that education takes place not only in schools \u2013 children can and should learn both in and out of school. A learning continuum is critical, so that all children continue to get an education irrespective of their situation, location, or the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigerian children are resilient, talented and aspire to do great things. And it is our responsibility to give them the platform and encouragement to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe know that protecting children and investing in women and families is not only the right thing to do it has proven to be a sound economic choice and a cost-effective tool for national development.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our children today, we must act in their best interests and deploy innovative solutions to fast-track learning and health services to build back better, for every Nigerian child.\u201d",

Part of this work has involved painstakingly reviewing existing Laws (like the Money Laundering Act, 2004, the EFCC Act, 2004 and the ICPC Act, 2000), to identify and highlight sections directly conferring powers of forfeiture on Nigeria\u2019s anticorruption agencies.

A few months ago, Andrea Pirlo, an icon of world football, began his new adventure, his first as a coach.\n\n\u201cTo do this, first of all, it takes courage, as well as awareness of one\u2019s own means, especially in a period marked by thousands of difficulties, with the world forced by the pandemic to reinvent its own rules day after day. \u201cPirlo has just begun the first steps of what will no doubt become a brilliant career as a coach. An adventure of transformation, seeking, and often managing, to bring his ideas and his experience as a champion on the pitch from the \u201cother side\u201d of the fence.",
