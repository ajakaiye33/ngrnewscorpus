          "title": "Democracy Day: 2023 polls, new opportunity to build on hope, potential of June 12, 1993 \u2013 Sanwo-Olu",
          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\n\n\n.Says work for a Greater Lagos continues amidst campaigns\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has expressed optimism in Nigeria democracy saying, the forthcoming 2023 general polls is a new opportunity to build on the hope and the potential of June 12, 1993, which must not be squandered 29 years after.\n\nSanwo-Olu, made the remark on Sunday in his address on the occasion of June 12, Democracy Day, in commemoration of the famous June 12, 1993 Presidential elections that were widely adjudged to be the freest and fairest in the history of Nigeria, believed to have been won by Are-Ona Kankanfo of Yoruba-land, Moshood Kasimawo Olawale, MKO Abiola, but which were tragically annulled by the military dictatorship at the time.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, \u201cOn this auspicious occasion of Democracy Day 2022, we celebrate all your efforts and commitment to the development of Lagos State, and to the strengthening of our democratic ideals.\n\n\u201cLet Democracy Day be a reminder of the importance of joining hands to build the future we want. 29 years ago on this day, Nigerians trooped enthusiastically to the polls, defying stereotypes of ethnicity and religion to prove to ourselves and the world that a new Nigeria is possible.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the powers-that-be at the time truncated that dream. But it was merely a delay, not a denial.\n\n\u201cWe have since been blessed with a new opportunity to build on the hope and the potential of June 12, 1993. That responsibility is now in our hands, and posterity will not forgive us if we squander it.\u201d\n\nRecounts birth of June 12 as Democracy Day\n\nThe governor went down memory lane saying,\u201dOn this occasion of the June 12, 2022 Democracy Day, it is my honour and privilege to specially commemorate our democratic journey, and all the very significant gains we have made over the last two decades.\n\n\u201cAfter three short-lived Republics, we entered a fourth that has now lasted 23 years, and seen, among other significant events, the transfer of presidential power from a ruling party to an opposition party.\n\n\u201cVery importantly, June 12 is also a day to remember the June 12, 1993, presidential elections that were widely adjudged to be the freest and fairest in the history of Nigeria, but which were tragically annulled by the military dictatorship at the time.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that the democracy we enjoy today in Nigeria has been built upon the immense sacrifice that June 12 represented and still represents.\n\n\u201cOur dear Lagos was the epicentre of the national protests and the activism that followed the annulment. Lagosians trooped out in large numbers, young and old, male and female, to make their voices heard, to stand up to the forces that wanted to deny the democratic rights of Nigerians to choose their President.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Bashorun Moshood Kasimawo Olawale, MKO Abiola, the winner of the June 12, 1993 election, lived and worked in Lagos. His business empire was headquartered here as well.\n\n\u201cLagos State gave the world the famous Epetedo Declaration, which was Bashorun Abiola\u2019s final public appearance. He was also arrested here in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIndeed, many of the leading names of the June 12 struggle were Lagosians, regardless of where they traced their ethnic or family origins.\n\n\u201cA lot of the blood that was shed, was shed in Lagos. Kudirat Abiola, Alfred Rewane, Sola Omatsola, were shot and killed in Lagos by murderous enemies of true democracy.\n\n\u201cMany others were forced underground, living in disguise and running from safe-house to safe-house across the city.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari righted a historical wrong by formally recognising June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, and we have commemorated the new day since 2019.\n\n\u201cBashorun Abiola and his running mate, Babagana Kingibe, were awarded the highest honours in the land, the GCFR and GCON, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn Mr. President\u2019s words, on that historic occasion: \u201cOur action today is to bury the negative side of June 12, the side of ill-feelings, hate, frustrations and agony.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is celebrating and appreciating the positive side of June 12, 1993. The June 12 that overcame our various divides, and the June 12 that produced unity and National cohesion. This is the June 12 we are celebrating today, and we will nurture it to our next generation.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu continued: \u201cThis is the challenge before all of us today, as Lagosians and Nigerians. June 12 must become a symbol of unity, of hope, of aspiration for a better tomorrow, one built upon true democratic ideals and practices.\n\n\u201cIt is perhaps fitting that we are celebrating this year\u2019s Democracy Day in the immediate aftermath of the first phase of the 2023 political season.\n\n\u201cIn the last four weeks the various political parties in the country have been holding Primaries to select their flagbearers for offices, from the State Houses of Assembly all the way to the Presidency.\n\n\u201cWe have seen our democracy at work. It is not perfect, but no democracy is. There are still gaps to be closed, and processes to be improved upon, but there is no doubt that the journey we started over two decades ago is fully on course and maturing.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year a new Electoral Act was passed by the National Assembly, and assented to by President Buhari. This is yet another milestone in our democratic journey, joining others like the Not Too Young To Run Act, and a number of amendments to our Constitution, some completed, others ongoing.\n\nWhich is exactly how democracy is meant to work: a constant and consistent effort at improvement, through the instrumentality of new laws, policies, and the introduction of technology.\n\n\u201cTherefore, ultimate goal of a democracy is to improve the lives of the people. As your elected government, we do not take this responsibility lightly at all. Since 1999, successive governments in Lagos State have worked hard to meet the yearnings of the people who have consistently given us the mandate through the ballot box.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for kickstarting this journey, and for laying the foundation for a truly modern and prosperous Lagos State. In education, healthcare, housing, transport, environment, technology, security, and many other areas, Lagos has continued to live up to its \u201cPacesetter\u201d status.\n\n\u201cAs we start the final year of our first term in office, our focus is on completing the many laudable programmes and projects that we have started. Even as this period will overlap with campaign season, you, the good people of Lagos State, can rest assured that we will never allow politicking to get in the way of governance.\n\n\u201cOur work for a Greater Lagos continues, even as we seek your mandate for a new term in office.\u201d\n\nThe governor, commended his co-travellers and colleagues in the ship of governance of Lagos State, for their immense dedication to the vision which include: the Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, all members of the State Executive Council; the Speaker,, State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, and all members of the Assembly.\n\nOthers include: the Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, and all members of the Judiciary; State Civil Service, traditional rulers, and the leadership of our Local Government Areas and Local Council Development Areas, LCDAs, All Progressives Congress, APC, for providing a home and platform for the manifestation of truly progressive ideas and solutions and all residents.",

          "text": ".\n\nTeachers in Ekiti State have affirmed their support for the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the June 18 election in the State, Hon Bisi Kolawole.\n\nThe teachers, who made this known during an interactive session with executives of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) union the Teacher\u2019s House, Ado Ekiti on Friday, said they will support the PDP candidate because of their love for the former governor of the State, Ayodele Fayose.\n\nThey said it was only during Fayose\u2019s government that teachers were elevated and celebrated in the State, and for this, they will vote Kolawole, who is being backed by the former governor.\n\n\u201cFor us teachers in Ekiti, PDP has paid its dues through Fayose, and for this, we will support Bisi Kolawole,\u201d they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP governorship candidate has assured that year of service of public school teachers in the State will be increased to forty years or sixty five years as retirement age.\n\nThis was part of the requests contained in a document signed by the Kolawole with the Ekiti State Chapter of the NUT during the interactive session.\n\nThe interactive session, which had former Governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayodele Fayose in attendance saw the former two term governor go memory lane on how his administration, in no small measure benefitted the teachers.\n\nFayose thanked the teachers for always standing by him in and out of government, saying; \u201cI thank you for your support during the 2018 election. You and I know that we won that election, but we were rigged out by the powers that be. It is time to have back what they stole from us.\u201d\n\nFayose, who recalled how he established the Tutor-General\u2019s office during his first term attributed successes recorded by his administration in the education sector to the enabling environment he provided the teachers.\n\n\u201cThe most important of all we do as people in power is to uphold the sanctity of life. Today, there is no life in terms of security in our state.\n\n\u201cJust recently, a Level 9 teacher on less than N60,000 salary after deduction was kidnapped.

          "title": "Mixed reactions trail older women dating younger men",
          "text": "Often times the popular saying, \u201cage is just a number\u201d, pops up when an older person is romantically involved with a younger person.\n\nFrom time immemorial, men were the usual suspect in cradle snatching but in recent times, women are gradually closing rank with men, probably because women are more independent financially, which has given them leverage.\n\nSome respondents in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday expressed divergent views on the idea of women dating and marrying men younger than them.\n\nA baker, Anita Ebere, told NAN that there was nothing wrong in a woman dating or married to a man younger than her, as long as there was mutual respect.\n\nAccording to Ebere, she is currently dating a younger man and her relationship is in bliss.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in dating a man younger if you are in love. I love my boyfriend who is four years younger than me, and we are getting married soon.\n\n\u201cAs long as there\u2019s mutual respect, I believe it\u2019s no big deal. As a man, he is the head of our home, that\u2019s not negotiable, as long as third parties are not privy to the information.\n\n\u201cMen, who are older than you tend to assert unnecessary authority over you, but younger men, are willing to hear you and carry you along in decision making,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeola Kolade, a fashion designer, said that younger men had more energy and life span to satisfy older women sexually.\n\n\u201cWoman are harder to satisfy sexually, some women with strong sexual appetites prefer younger men because they have the stamina to satisfy their sexual desires,\u201d Kolade said.\n\nMiss Priscilla Badmus, a fashion stylist and entrepreneur, told NAN that \u201clove is not predictable, and women have their preferences.\n\n\u201cI prefer to date and marry an older man than marrying someone younger than me. I don\u2019t have any reason. It\u2019s just my taste; women who date younger men spend more in relationships, especially in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, if it happens that the young man has more money than the older woman, then many things will be compromised in the relationship, it\u2019s all about preference.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stephen Odeyemi, a banker, dating a younger person irrespective of gender is a personal thing as long as the relationship is mutually beneficial.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe younger men date older women just because of money, there are lots of young men who love the peace of mind that comes with being with someone who\u2019s mature and older.\n\n\u201cAs I said, it depends on the two parties. For me, dating can work but marrying someone older than me, there are many risks involved like authority and money issues.\n\n\u201cA younger person will not feel intimidated by your authority; an older woman because of experience might want to drag leadership. It may not end up well,\u201d he said.\n\nHassan Baker, a businessman, said that older woman tend to be more understanding and patient in relationships.\n\n\u201cYounger ladies only seek sex, money and material things from men. But an older woman will plan along with you with maturity.\n\n\u201cI love being married to a woman older than me, satisfying a woman younger than me is something I can\u2019t think of, younger women have a strong sexual appetite than a woman older than you.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t love my wife initially, but I grew to love her because she was patient with me and also because of family pressure, I had to. They didn\u2019t even know she was older. She had this sense of comportment.\n\n\u201cMy wife spends more than me because she is the richer one. She doesn\u2019t even bully me, and I don\u2019t feel threatened in any way, financially or sexually,\u201d he said.\n\nMr John Ademuyiwa, a civil servant, told NAN that the economic situation of the country had made it difficult to understand some current trends.\n\n\u201cIn the society, a lot of things are happening. You meet a very young handsome boy that is hopeful and can\u2019t feed himself and you can give him money and befriend him, he will follow you, and I think it\u2019s just the economy.\n\n\u201cThe economy is doing a lot of things. It makes it easier for a young man who is supposed to meet a very young girl, to prefer an elderly woman.\n\n\u201cOlder women will be like have you eaten today? Let me send some money to your account, she gives you relief and when the elderly woman is going to help you, the young one will be taking from him,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the woman may be serious about the relationship, but the young man cannot be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be committed to that kind of relationship. In the African setting, it\u2019s actually difficult for a man to be naturally in love with a woman like that.\n\n\u201cSomething is always attached to it, he collects the money and you give her the attention. But if you ask him to marry that kind of elderly woman, he will be ashamed.\n\n\u201cThe older woman puts all of her heart in it but for the boys, they might still have their small small girls around,\u201d Ademuyiwa said.\n\nAdemuyiwa, however, said that it was easy for a young lady to fully fall in love with an older man than for a boy to truly be in love with an older woman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a girl to fall in love because the man will be very kind, take care of her, treat her like a queen, and always show that he wouldn\u2019t beat her anyway. While her mates will beat her up, the man will not beat her.\n\n\u201cShe might end up really wanting to marry him.

It is a way of life that must be held sacrosanct. We must therefore guard our democracy jealously.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Governor called for the strengthening of democratic institutions in the country \u201cso that the practice of democracy should not be at the dictates or the whims and caprices of a few individuals who think they will lord it over the general public but the wishes of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cthe unabating security situation where armed Fulani terrorists are seizing the sovereignty of the country is already a threat to the people\u2019s hard earned democracy;\u201d a development he lamented had become a cause for concern because the APC led Federal Government had not given priority attention to the menace.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cDemocracy should be our way of life, it is freedom to exercise our franchise in an uninterrupted environment. But insecurity has forced majority of our people away from their ancestral lands and made their living conditions less than humans because they are now forced to live in shanties which is a major challenge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is why the federal government must wake up to its responsibility and tackle the menace headlong.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore cannot be celebrating democracy day when our citizens are now slaves and not free in their homes, schools, worship centres, workplaces and cannot go to their farms or even travel freely on our roads or by train. We must tackle the issue of insecurity courageously if we are to practice democracy freely.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, Governor Ortom said his administration has \u201cin the last seven years, provided dividends of democracy in education, health, agriculture, infrastructure and other critical sectors of development, in the face of daunting economic and security challenges.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore appreciate the people of Benue State for the support given us and assure them that our administration will not waver. We will sustain the tempo in this remaining year.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile paying glowing tribute to the June 12, 1993 Democracy martyr Chief M.K.O . Abiola, Governor Ortom prayed that what led to the ill-fated third republic would never reoccur in the country.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Olawale\n\nThe European Union, EU, has admonished Nigerian youths to be part of the electoral process in the country, saying their voters\u2019 card is the only power they have to make the real change happen in 2023.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos during a Mega Musical Concert on \u201cYouth Vote Count\u201d organised by EU in partnership with Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and some other partners, EU\u2019s Ambassador to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi said that voters\u2019 turnout in Nigeria remain low and not a good indication for democracy.\n\nShe said: \u2018You know that voterS\u2019 turnout in Nigeria is very low and that is not good. You also know that voter turnout of young Nigeria is very low which is not good as well. This is why we are here, we need to change this trend, to mobilise the youths.\n\n\u201cYou have the power to make change happen, you have the power to make the difference, therefore, dont give up your power because your vote is your power. Your voters card is your power, so get it and use it on the election day because your vote will count.\u201d\n\nIsopi said the number of people registered by INEC in one week showed that the exercise is a huge success and a sign of hope for a better future for Nigeria.\n\nShe said it is also a sign of trust and confidence in the electoral process that has made tremendous progress in the last few years.\n\nThe ambassador said the reforms, changes, technologies and innovations introduced by INEC have made elections more transparent and credible adding that the changes have also made it possible for the commission to protect the votes of every Nigerian.\n\nThe awareness campaign, held at Tafawa Balewa Square, TBS, aims to mobilise and get youths registered in the Continuous Voters\u2019 Registration (CVR).\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the commission would soon make its stand known on calls for extension of June 30 deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nHe also disclosed that no fewer than 5000 people were registered at the TBS registration centre in the last one week.\n\nAmidst several calls for the extension of the CVR, the INEC Chairman told the youths that they would soon hear from the commission and advised them to get their PVC to vote.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are two things you want from INEC. One, you want your PVCs. I want to assure you that you would have your PVC. In the last one week, we registered more than 5000 people here. Yesterday, when we saw the crowd that trooped out to register, we said we must change strategy.\n\n\u201cSo we said instead of everyone coming to TBS to register, you would register in 20 centres in 20 local government areas in Lagos and more machines would be deployed all over Lagos from next week.\n\n\u201cSecondly, I know you want to hear from INEC, are we going to end the registration on 30th June? We heard you loudly and clearly. You want more time for all Nigerians to register for PVC. You will hear from INEC very soon on that. Next, you want to hear from INEC, if we register and vote, will our votes count? Let me assure you, your votes will count.\u201d\n\nAt the Tafawa Balewa Square, where the event took place, many entertainers, singers and content creators spiced up the concert and specifically reminded them to get their permanent voters card (PVC) to be eligible to participate in the elections.\n\nAmong the artistes in attendance were Alhaji Wasiu Alabi Pasuma; Aituaje Iruobe, known as Waje; Debo Adedayo (Mr. Macaroni); Omawumi Megbele (Omowumi); Adekunle Temitope (Small Doctor), Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi, Comedian, Broda Shaggi and others.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday in his Democracy Day broadcast urged Nigerians to pray for all victims of terrorists attacks across the nation.\n\nBuhari, who spoke on many issues, called for support for his administration, stating that he lives daily worrying about those in the custody of kidnappers and other criminal elements.\n\nBuhari also assured Nigerians that efforts were on top gear to ensure that the victims were freed safely.\n\nFull text of his speech:\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "title": "OAU VC: As Ogunbodede bows out",
          "text": "After five years of selfless and steadfast service to God and humanity through the instrumentality of the office of the Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University(OAU) Ile-Ife, Prof. Eyitope Ogungbenro Ogunbodede, in a couple of days will take a bow out of office with his head held high\n\nThe 11th Vice Chancellor who has successfully completed his five-year single tenure will be succeeded by Prof. Adebayo Simeon Bamire of Agricultural Economics department as the 12th Chief Executive office of the institution.\n\nAs one of the contractors who regularly bid and get contracts in Obafemi Awolowo University, I have deliberately waited for this hour before sharing my experience during the tenure of Prof. Ogunbodede. This is because I don\u2019t want some people to read unnecessary meanings to my position. Before Prof. Ogunbodede, I had, like many other contractors, interacted with many Vice Chancellors of Nigerian universities in the course of bidding for contracts all over Nigeria. Prof. Ogunbodede is one of the few incorruptible chief executives who will never ask any contractor to give him kickbacks or bribes. I challenge any contractor to controvert my assertion.\n\nAsk many people to define Nigeria, you will be shocked by the litany of negative definitions you will get. It is not impossible for some people to describe Nigeria as a country of exploitation, manipulation and appalling hydra-headed corruption. This definition may not be unconnected with the activities of some people who are ready to drain from those dying of dearth without giving a hoot.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ivory tower is in crisis today, wrecked by under-funding, poor quality of infrastructure, partly as a result of the activities of some greedy and gluttonous who have wrecked hellish havoc. A society discovers its essence in its leaders. Many people have argued that Nigeria\u2019s greatest problems are poor leadership and corruption.\n\nHowever, when we see a good leader, who displays sterling qualities without getting involved in corruption, it behooves us to celebrate such a leader. This is the essence of this piece. Although I didn\u2019t get many contracts during the tenure of Prof. Ogunbodede, my interaction with him, as well as the testimonies from other contractors, clearly marks him out as a leader whose moral authority comes from following universal and timeless principles like honesty, integrity and truth.\n\nIndeed, one of the most prized possessions of the Professor of Dentistry is integrity, and he led OAU for five years without compromising it. Prof Ogunbodede really won my heart and that of others with the way he related to contractors with absolute transparency .\n\nOnce you won a bid, his major concern was go and do your job and ensure you do a quality job. He will never ask you for any gratification either directly or through proxy. Integrity, honesty and truth are the highest vibrating energies that guided his tenure. To him, the foundation stones for a balanced success are honesty, character, integrity, faith, love and loyalty. He could be gay and gregarious, but he is also tough-minded, strong-willed and self-possessed.\n\nClearly, Prof. Ogunbodede is a beacon and blistering light in usually impossible tunnels, whose temper constitutes the template for enviable conducts. Everyone appreciates his energy and purity of purpose as he, as well, radiates so much zest in fellowship and personal service.\n\nTo me, Prof. Ogunmodede is an epitome of what Yoruba call \u201cOmoluabi\u201d. The Omoluabi is a philosophical and cultural concept that is native to the Yoruba people, used to describe a person of good character. The Omoluabi concept signifies courage, truth, honesty, integrity, hard work, humility and respect. All these and more were the values Prof. Ogunmodede brought to bear during his tenure in OAU.\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how an individual could be so focused, consistent and irrevocably committed to the development of the University as the outgoing VC did. His huge intellectual savvy, uncompromising sense of justice, uncommon courage and steely grit in defence of rule of law and justice are amazing.\n\nClearly, Nigeria needs men and women of courage, character and capacity in leadership positions. Prof. Ogunmodede is certainly one of the fine materials available for the political class to consider for appointment in this coming dispensation. For all he did in Ife without soiling his hands, this great man of intellect still has a lot to offer Nigeria. In Ife, he has charted a future rich in promise and possibilities. As a visible testimony to the sagaciousness of his leadership skills, we appreciate the rapid and unprecedented physical, spiritual and academic growth of OAU. We salute the dexterity of his doggedness. An active life must be nourished by activities.\n\nThose in leadership positions should know that every action of our lives touches some chord that will vibrate in eternity. What Prof. Ogunmodede did yesterday as OAU VC is what we are talking about today. Those who are privileged to lead must leave enviable legacies. As Bob Marley will say \u201cthe greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively\u201d\n\nNigeria is a blessed country. We are greatly endowed but poorly managed. We have no reason to be poor. In order to convert our endowments to greatness, therefore, the like of Prof. Ogunmodede should be fished out and given opportunities to serve. He is a perfect-picture of geniality and civility. He is sired in the true tenets of African virtues and values. As a true leader, he is not swayed by extraneous emotionalism and parochial cant.\n\nProf. Ogunbodede was born 23 January 1957. He attended Owo High School where he obtained the West African School Certificate in 1976. He then proceeded to Obafemi Awolowo University where he received a BSc in Health Sciences and a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BchD) in 1981 and 1985 respectively. He also has a Masters in Public Health degree from the University of Lagos (1989) and was a Commonwealth Medical Fellow at University College London between 1991 and 1993\n\nMay God select good leaders for Nigeria as we transit to a fresh regime in 2023.",
          "summary": "Prof. Ogunbodede is one of the few incorruptible chief executives who will never ask any contractor to give him kickbacks or bribes.\nProf Ogunbodede really won my heart and that of others with the way he related to contractors with absolute transparency .\nClearly, Prof. Ogunbodede is a beacon and blistering light in usually impossible tunnels, whose temper constitutes the template for enviable conducts.\nWhat Prof. Ogunmodede did yesterday as OAU VC is what we are talking about today.\nProf. Ogunbodede was born 23 January 1957.",

          "title": "Democracy Day: In honour of Abiola, 2023 transition must be peaceful- Buhari",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has noted that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections, he has therefore, charged Nigerians that in honour and memory of one of national heroes for democracy, Chief Moshood Abiola, everything must be done to ensure the transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe President made the call in his national address to the on the occasion of commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day, June 12, 2022.\n\nThe President, who said he would have been out office then, recalled that Democracy Day was moved 2018 from 29th of May to the 12th of June, in order to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\u201d\n\nBuhari expressed hope that the country will achieve peaceful transition, noting the positive signs are there especially, with the successful conduct of primaries by all registered political parties to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n\u201cI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n\u201cAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n\u201cAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\u201d\n\nPresident who touched on the achievements of his administration, said in order to address the concerns over rising in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country, his administration is working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nHe charged citizens not to leave it to government alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\u201d\n\nThe full speech is below:\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24.

          "title": "2023 presidency: Furore over Muslim-Muslim ticket",
          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna and John Adams, Minna\n\nFresh facts have emerged that the idea of Muslim-Muslim ticket for the 2023 presidency was actually mooted in Kaduna on May 12, 2022 when the All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, visited Kaduna delegates to canvass their votes as an aspirant.\n\nFew minutes after the delegates had endorsed Tinubu for the presidency, the lawmaker representing Sabon Gari, Kaduna, Federal Constituency and Chairman House Committee on Ports and Harbours, Hon. Garba Datti Mohammed Babawo appealed to Tinubu to pick governor Nasir el-Rufai as his running mate.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBabawo said: \u201cWe have a request for you sir, what I\u2019m about to say I did not tell our governor because I know if I tell him he would not support it. We want you to take our governor as your running mate. We don\u2019t want him to go and settle outside the country after the election because we know his plan. His plan is to leave the country and live in overseas after his tenure as the governor. But we want him to serve the country as your running mate\u201d.\n\nBabawo\u2019s request came on the heels of the closing ceremony of the event after all the speakers were done with their speeches, and, therefore, there was no provision for Tinubu to respond to the request on the spot.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed reports said that the presidential hopeful showered the Kaduna delegates with large sum of money.\n\nEarlier, in his remarks at the event, the former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima said that Tinubu has the leadership attributes of all the past leaders of the country, particularly General Yakubu Gowon (rtd) for his humility and peace loving manner.\n\nShettima added that one could as well find attributes of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) and General Sani Abacha in Tinubu, explaining that the now APC presidential candidate is a pan-Nigerian to the core.\n\nThe delegates gave their support to Tinubu after Governor Nasir el-Rufai said that he would only rally round any candidate supported by the delegates.\n\nWhen the delegates said they would support Tinubu, el-Rufai then said he would support Tinubu too.\n\nEl-Rufai also thanked Tinubu for the visit and for remembering Kaduna during its trying moments and for his generosity.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou are the first presidential aspirant to come to Kaduna, you are not taking us for granted, we will not forget that.\n\n\u201cYou have spoken to our people, they appear convinced, and when the people of Kaduna give their words, sir, you can be rest assured of our support.\n\n\u201cWe keep to our words and ensure that as we intend to keep our promise. We will also want you to promise to deal with insecurity, and infrastructure and support agriculture and empowerment.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Tinubu assured Nigerians that his leadership would bring peace, stability and end banditry and killings if elected.\n\nThe APC national leader said that he remained the most capable candidate for the job.\n\n\u201cGovernance is not about your physical strength, it is not about wrestling, it is about thinking, we are going to use the brain to bring development and innovations to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am the best of all of them. In terms of experience, private sector, governance, we joined hands together to form APC, We have never failed, and we will not fail, our broom will sweep them away. I know the road, follow the man who knows the road,\u201d Tinubu pleaded.\n\n\u2026We\u2019ve not forgiven el-Rufai over Muslim-Muslim ticket in Kaduna \u2013SOKAPU\n\nSouthern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU) has said that any political party that fields a Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian ticket in the 2023 Kaduna State governorship polls will fail because the people have not forgiven Governor el-Rufai for introducing a Muslim-Muslim ticket in Kaduna.\n\nPresident of SOKAPU, Jonathan Asake, said that the people would never accept such political arrangement again in the state.\n\n\u201cOn a good day, in 2023, Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket is dead on arrival in Kaduna State,\u201d Asake vowed.\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai had in the heels of the 2019 general elections, announced Dr Hadiza Balarabe, a fellow Muslim, as his running mate.\n\nThe move generated a lot of reactions from the Christian population because Balarabe like el-Rufai is a Muslim.\n\nBut el-Rufai had maintained that government house was not a worship centre and such consideration was not given to appointment based on religious or ethnic background.\n\nHowever, the SOKAPU president said that if any political party goes with a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the state, there would be another way out, \u201cbecause Kaduna people are wiser now\u201d.\n\nOn current Muslim-Muslim ticket in Kaduna State, he alleged that Governor el-Rufai brought in the ticket to get in tune with the idea he nurtured as a divisive governor.\n\n\u201cIn any case, diversity is manipulated, it brings in-fighting and lack of peace. When el-Rufai said Christians population were 30 per cent and Muslim 70 per cent on a national television, it was a precursor to introducing Muslim-Muslim ticket. He had to invoke sentiment to get away with it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2026You\u2019re playing with fire, Vatsa, Niger APC chieftain, warns Governor el-Rufai,\n\nAs the battle of who becomes the running mate to the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential standard bearer in the 2023 general election, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, hots up, former Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism and an chieftain of APC in Niger State, Mr Jonathan Vatsa, has taken a swept on the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasiru el-Rufai over his comment that Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket will not be a problem for the 2023 election.\n\nAccording to Vatsa such arrangement will not only spell doom for the party, but will also amount to \u201cplaying with fire\u201d.\n\n\u201cKaduna State is smaller than Nigeria, if el-Rufai succeeded in Kaduna with Muslim-Muslim ticket because he made sure the Christian communities in southern Kaduna did not come out to vote in 2019 general elections to show their anger, such experiment cannot work in the presidential election in 2023\u201d.\n\nThe former APC publicity secretary in Niger State in a statement in Minna on Saturday, entitled: \u201cthe Christians are awake and alive in Nigeria ahead of 2023 general elections\u201d, advised Bola Tinubu to disregard the comment by Governor el-Rufai \u201cbecause no Christian in Nigeria can vote for Tinubu if he goes ahead with a Muslim-Muslim ticket\u201d.\n\nVatsa said that those scheming for vice president position like el-Rufai are the ones advocating for a Muslim-Muslim ticket because of their unrealizable ambition even when they know full well that it is not absolutely possible, stressing that \u201cthis country called Nigeria has grown pass what people like el-Rufai think\u201d.\n\nWhile describing the Kaduna State governor as the \u201cmost unqualified\u201d as running mate to Tinubu, Vatsa pointed out that \u201cthese type of people are capable of igniting religious war in the country, he failed woefully to govern Kaduna State, and turned the state into a killer field and now he wants to be vice president\u201d.\n\nAccording to Vatsa, \u201cthe entire Christian communities in Southern Kaduna came under attack few weeks to the 2019 general elections just because they don\u2019t want the people to come out and vote and speak through the ballot box. It was an evil plot against the people and the whole world knew it.\n\n\u201cOur national leader and presidential flag bearer, Bola Tinubu is more intelligent than him, he is politically wiser than el-Rufai, he knows everybody\u2019s antecedent so he cannot be deceived. Tinubu knows that Muslim-Muslim ticket will spell doom for him and APC in 2023\u201d.\n\nHe reminded el-Rufai that politicians in the country, including himself, have made religion the first consideration in everything they do today, and recalled how Governor el-Rafuai declared every Friday as public holiday in the state because of his religious bigot, wondering why such a person should tell Nigerians not to lay emphasis on religion.\n\n\u201cNow that el-Rufai is looking for vice president, he wants Nigerians to put religious consideration in our dealings behind, when every form you fill in Nigeria today, they will ask you of your religion,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nHe maintained that the governor should not talk about the issue of competence \u201cbecause we can find competent people in all the religions in Nigeria, including among idol worshipers that can be Vice President.\n\n\u201cThere are very intelligent, competent and highly respected Christians in the North that can be vice president to Tinubu. Those who have turned their state to war zone should not dream of becoming vice president of this country.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nSince actress Peju Johnson made her debut in Nollywood, she has continued to soar like the eagle.\n\nIn this interview, the light-skinned script interpreter, who recently released her first movie, PJ (Pelumi Jonathan), opened up on her career, love life, challenges and lots more. Enjoy it:\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAs you age gracefully, what are you looking forward to?\n\nI am looking forward to a better life and future. I want to be able to achieve my dreams, with somebody\u2019s son finding me, settling down, and having my own family. I am really looking up to all that.\n\nHow soon should we expect the wedding bells?\n\nThis year! I really hope and pray so because I want it to happen soon.\n\nIs there any pressure on you from home to settle down with a man?\n\nNo pressure at all from home. My mum is a very loving woman. She is understanding, and won\u2019t force or rush me into taking a wrong decision because she knows everything happens at the right time and God\u2019s time is the best. Although, she asks once in a while, she\u2019s never pressurising me.\n\nWhat\u2019s your ideal man?\n\nHmmm\u2026 I love a loving, tall, dark, caring, romantic and respectful man. Most importantly, he must be God fearing because if a man can fear God, the rest is simple. Nowadays, men don\u2019t even fear themselves not to talk of God.\n\nWhat would make you reject a suitor?\n\nI can reject a man if he doesn\u2019t have respect for me or for other people. I don\u2019t like men that are disrespectful to women or anyone else at that.\n\nYou proudly show off your curves on social media, how do you deal with negative comments?\n\nI don\u2019t give negative people chance in my space. I always respond by blocking them. They are bitter because they have nothing to show, and they are not better than me, or anyone that shows off.\n\nWhat is the most embarrassing message you have got on Instagram?\n\nSome people call themselves my fans, asking for my price to spend time with them and all, and some sending me pictures of their private parts. Obviously, they are not my fans because anyone that calls himself my fan wouldn\u2019t do such. I always feel embarrassed seeing all those kind of messages on my social media platforms.\n\nWhat was the bad moment that almost made you dump acting?\n\nIt\u2019s working, working and working without getting paid, all because you\u2019re an upcoming actress. At a point, I got tired and wanted to dump acting.\n\nCan you recall your most memorable birthday celebration?\n\nThat was when I lost my passport on my birthday and also locked my car key inside the car. It was indeed a memorable day because I was sad all day. I can\u2019t forget that day in a hurry.\n\nHave you ever considered liposuction to enhance your butts?\n\nI have never thought of it for once because I love my body the way it is. I have boobs and ass and they are very moderate. I thank God for these blessings.\n\nSo far, what would you say is your greatest achievement this year?\n\nSo far, I give glory to God, especially for good health. Although, it\u2019s not really been good, there are so many ups and downs. But I thank God for good health. That is the most important thing.\n\nYou got lots of brand endorsements this year, what\u2019s the secret?\n\nI\u2019m hoping and praying to have more and more endorsement deals. There is no secret to it. Just keep doing what you know how to do best.\n\nWhich pays better between brand influencing and movies?\n\nOf course, brand influencing pays more. Movies are really not paying us well.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on cheating partners?\n\nMy dear, they are becoming so rampant nowadays. Most people cheat in relationships and its really becoming scary. Cheating partners would always be cheating partners; they hardly change. It\u2019s making me think that love doesn\u2019t exist. I am even scared of settling down.\n\nWhat would make you forgive a cheating partner?\n\nI can forgive a cheating partner, but I can\u2019t allow him back into my life. I forgive, but I don\u2019t forget. Even, if I allow him back, we won\u2019t enjoy the relationship anymore, because the trust is gone and relationship without trust is useless.\n\nHow do you deal with heartbreaks?\n\nI\u2019m a very strong woman. I don\u2019t love often. I hardly love or date. But once I do, I really love the person. And when they hurt me, I always break down, mentally and emotionally. But once I manage to get up, they are always dead to me. I break down for sometime and get back up, and I would stop dating till I see someone better and worth it.\n\nBetween love, sex and money, which comes first for you?\n\nMoney comes first because money will not wake up one day and break your heart. I don\u2019t even like sex.\n\nWould you prefer cooking or eating out?\n\nI love cooking. I am a good cook. I eat at home most of the time. So, I prefer cooking to eating out.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month! Skills open the doors to financial opportunities Click here to learn it .",

          "title": "Buhari: We Must Never Forget the Sacrifices of Heroes of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy",
          "text": "For the record\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June the 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u2022 Being an address by President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of the commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day 2022\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We must never see it as a \u2018do or die affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority.

As leaders, you must all showcase the high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide an example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n\u201cFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last seven years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nCommenting on security challenges facing the nation and how they could affect the coming elections, President Buhari said the government was working to contain the issues so that the 2023 elections could be preserved and secure.\n\nHis words: \u201cI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of the government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we can prevent a crime, not after the crime has been committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n\u201cFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nBuhari also flayed the administration of former military president, General Babangida, which annulled the June 12, 1993, presidential poll adjudged as the freest election ever conducted in the electoral history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn June 12, 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24, 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n\u201cWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nAtiku, Gbajabiamila, Tinubu, Obaseki, Others Urge Nigerians to Remain Hopeful\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement Atiku signed as part of the 2022 Democracy Day message, the former vice president said the celebration should provide Nigerians with no room to stomach rhyme and rhetoric, but salient facts, sobriety and the promise of a better tomorrow.\n\nHe described it as an auspicious period to rally around all compatriots, to think and work in concert for the unity, security, equity, inclusivity, socio-economic prosperity and equitable development of our country.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s gather the numbers and commitment to kick out APC \u2013 the borrowing and sorrowing party. Let\u2019s remember that Nigeria\u2019s current debt burden stands at over N41 trillion with less than $40billion reserve\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Tinubu in his June 12 message, said although Nigerians are diverse in terms of ethnicity and religion, everyone seeks good governance, better life and the positive things that result from sustained good governance.\n\nAccording to him, \u201con this day, June 12, we celebrate democracy and commemorate those who have sacrificed so much to establish this most benign and noble form of governance in our land.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Gbajabiamila said Nigerians have a lot to celebrate as the country\u2019s democracy has developed in the past twenty-three years.\n\nHe expressed delight at how the citizens have embraced democratic governance in the past two decades, saying there is a lot to come in the coming years in terms of dividends of democracy.\n\nIn his message, Obaseki tasked Nigerians to uphold the ideals of the nation\u2019s founding fathers, who fought assiduously for the realisation of an independent country rooted in the values of justice and equity.\n\nThe governor urged citizens to recommit to the process of \u201crenewing ourselves and work in unison to make our country live up to its promise as the greatest black nation on earth.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Sanwo-Olu urged Lagosians to let Democracy Day be a reminder of the importance of joining hands to build the future they want.\n\nHe said since the ultimate goal of democracy is to improve the lives of the people, his government has resolved not take this responsibility lightly at all.\n\nSimilarly, human rights activist and President of Women Arise, Dr Okei-Odumakin, in a statement, warned that as the scramble for 2023 gathers speed, the import of June 12, 1993, must remain in the mind of Nigerians as nothing has changed.\n\nAkeredolu Cancels Democracy Day Celebration over Owo Carnage\n\nIn another development, Ondo State Governor, Akeredolu has cancelled the celebration of Democracy Day in the state due to last Sunday\u2019s attack on the St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo. Akeredolu announced the cancellation on his official Twitter handle, @RotimiAkeredolu yesterday.\n\nIn his tweet, Akeredolu said: \u201cIn honour of the victims of the terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, the Ondo State Government has cancelled this year\u2019s June 12 celebration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cancellation is to enable the people of Ondo State to mourn their loved ones who lost their lives in the horrific attack.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the South-west Speakers have condemned the gruesome attack on Owo Catholic church.\n\nIn a statement by the Chairman, South-west Speaker\u2019s Conference, Hon. Bamidele Oleyelogun also commiserated with Akeredolu.\n\nOleyelogun, who is the Speaker Ondo State House of Assembly, said the ancient town of Owo, which was known for peace before the strike by terrorists caused havoc to many households affected by the ugly trend.\n\nNigeria is Being Handed over to Looters, ASUU Cries Out\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has warned that the exclusion of best brains in Nigerian politics through high nomination forms would place the future of the country in the hands of looters.\n\nThe Chairman, University of Ibadan chapter of the union, Prof. Ayoola Akinwole, gave the warning in a June 12 message issued yesterday in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIt is a strategy of handing over the country to those individuals who have looted the country in the past. If this practice goes unchallenged, Nigerians are in for not just another regime of poor governance but that of extreme corruption and looting.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that it will take a Nigerian Professor who earns N416, 000 per month but saves 20 per cent of his salary over 100 years to be able to purchase the presidential nomination form of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and over 40 years to buy the form of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAkinwole maintained that the 23 years of the return of democracy have been characterised by \u201cleadership of empty promises and dashed hopes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022Okowa tops list of contenders as odds favour South-south\n\n\u2022 APC considers Lawan, Lalong, Bagudu, Buni, Badaru, Amina Mohammed, three others\n\n\u2022Afenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF, PANDEF await decisions of parties on running mates\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nBarring any last-minute changes, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will on Tuesday unveil the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is as the All Progressives Congress (APC) is considering the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, from Yobe State; Governors Simon Lalong of Plateau State, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State; and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, from Adamawa State, for the position of the running mate to its presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Amina Mohammed from Gombe State; former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, also from Borno State. A source privy to the horse-trading told THISDAY that a committee had been set up to carefully examine the chances of each of the candidates and make recommendations to the party.\n\nThe source disclosed that Tinubu has said that he has not thought of it.\n\nFor the PDP, THISDAY gathered that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State tops the list of contenders for Atiku\u2019s running mate as the odds favour the South-south geopolitical zone following concerns that the emergence of a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi as the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) will swing the South-east votes in favour of LP.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the pan-Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and their counterparts in the Middle Belt and the Niger Delta \u2013 the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) are awaiting the decisions of the political parties on their choices of running mates before declaring their support.\n\nSome chieftains of the ruling APC have argued that religion should not be a factor in determining the party\u2019s vice-presidential ticket.\n\nThe leadership of the PDP had after the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the party set up a high-powered committee to drive a rancour-free emergence of his running mate.\n\nThe committee convened several discrete meetings where it met with Atiku and other stakeholders.\n\nA source privy to the meetings told THISDAY that \u201cthe committee has met with all concerned and would unveil its choice Tuesday ahead of the June 17 deadline for the submission of the names of the PDP presidential candidate and his running mate to INEC.\u201d\n\nThe source disclosed that the committee narrowed the search for Atiku\u2019s running mate to the South-south geopolitical zone following the concern that the South-east will vote massively for the Labour Party\u2019s candidate, Obi.\n\nHe explained that under this circumstance, the main opposition party now believes that its strength lies in the South-south as it is also believed that the South-west would be a no-go area for the PDP because of the emergence of the former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\nThe source further disclosed that two governors of the South-south, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and one other unnamed governor are the two major contenders for the PDP vice-presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThough the leaders of the party believe that the conduct of the unnamed governor is not befitting of a vice presidential candidate, he is being considered because it is believed that he has enormous financial prowess to finance the PDP presidential campaigns. The governor is unfit for the job and that is why Okowa is at the top of the list,\u201d the source added.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the party has mounted pressure on the governor to accept a ministerial position.\n\nIt was also gathered that the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is ruled out because she prefers to remain in her current position.\n\nThe PDP stakeholders are said to be concerned that the emergence of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) would erode APC and PDP votes in the North-west.\n\nThe source said that the APC had won in all the 44 local government areas in Kano State in 2019 with 1.4 million votes, while the PDP got 391,593 votes.\n\n\u201cWith the rising profile of NNPP, the APC may not have votes again as was the case in 2015 and 2019. So, the party is depending on its stakeholders in the North-west to rein in more votes for Atiku in the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the APC is considering the Senate President, Lawan; Governors Lalong, Bagudu, Buni, Badaru; and the Secretary to the SGF, Mustapha, for the position of the running mate to Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Mohammed; former governor of Borno State, Senator Shettima and Imam.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Mohammed is being considered for gender balancing.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF, PANDEF Await Decisions of Parties on Running Mates\n\nIn a related development, the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu has disclosed that his organisation would meet with Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere and PANDEF after the emergence of the parties\u2019 running mates.\n\nHe said MBF would not be hasty in deciding which political party to support in the 2023 general election, noting that they would study the situation and also watch where the candidates would select their running mates.\n\nPogu, who spoke exclusively to THISDAY, added that there would be alignments and realignments ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said that the MBF consult with Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo to arrive at a decision on which party or candidate to support.\n\nPohu said, \u201cAPC is not the only party that has elected a southern candidate; there are other political parties with Southern candidates. We will sit down and review the situation after the aspirants have all picked their running mates, we shall then meet with our friends \u2013 Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, and arrive at a decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I am saying is that after the choices of running mates, there may be migrations across party lines, and some changes will begin. I say this because Nigerians cannot be taken for a ride.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the volume of people registering now is unprecedented; it has never happened this way before. It shows that Nigerians are up for something.\u201d\n\nReligion Should Not Be a Factor, Say APC Chieftains\n\nMeanwhile, some chieftains of the ruling APC have argued that religion should not be a factor in the consideration of the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN); former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Babachir Lawal and other stakeholders had kicked against the Muslim-Muslim ticket, insisting that ethnoreligious factors are still very much relevant in Nigerian politics. But the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai believed that competence should be a major consideration and not religion.\n\nA National Vice Chairman of the party, Dr Salihu Lukman, in a statement issued yesterday said kicking against the Muslim-Muslim ticket was a backward national mindset, which must be changed.\n\nHe said as important as ethnic and religious identities are, addressing challenges facing the country requires that political leaders are not allowed to ride on cheap sentiments of religion and ethnicity to opportunistically win elections.\n\n\u201cIf choices of leaders are dictated by ethnoreligious factors, Nigerian politics will continue to be disadvantageous to many sections of the country. For instance, only Christian Southerners and Muslim Northerners will continue to have advantages.\n\nThe Deputy National Organising Secretary of the party, Hon. Nze Duru told THISDAY that consultations were still ongoing in the party regarding the issue of the running mate.\n\nHe added that it remains the prerogative of the candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu to choose a running mate that would complement his strength.\n\n\u201cWhat is important for Nigeria today is good governance, creating the level-playing field; giving hope to the people of this country,\u201d Duru explained.\n\nOn his part, former National Vice Chairman of APC, South-south, Hilliard Etta, said he did not predicate his politics on religion or ethnic consideration.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf my politics was considered on ethnic considerations. I would have worked and voted for (Rotimi) Amaechi. He\u2019s from my zone; I don\u2019t care about those kinds of things. Those are the things that have held Nigeria down,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, the former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Yekini Nabena, stated that the important factor is the personality involved and not his religion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*\u2018It\u2019s a threat to fragile peace, unity of Nigeria\u2019\n\n*Babachir: Nigerians conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics\n\n*El-rufai: Competence vital for running mate, not religion\n\n*Osinbajo promises to support Tinubu\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Northern Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) yesterday expressed opposition to alleged moves by the presidential candidates of Nigeria\u2019s two leading political party to present Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election, cautioning that Christians will reject any political party that fails to heed its warning.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Atiku Abubakar, a Muslim holds the presidential flag of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) while Bola Tinubu, also a Muslim picked that of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last Wednesday. The two are now searching for running mates.\n\n\n\nCAN and NOSCEF\u2019s caveats are coming on the heels of a similar one by the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, to the APC against a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, saying Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nBut Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stressed yesterday that competence should determine his party\u2019s choice of presidential running mate instead of religion.\n\nOn the same day, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his readiness to give total support to Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nCAN, in the statement signed by its National Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola warned the two leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe want to unequivocally state that it is a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria,\u201d said CAN.\n\nIt urged all political parties to ensure that the balance of both religious practitioners is considered in the choice of running mates for the presidential candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now. Any party that tries same religion ticket will fail.\n\n\u201cThis is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power? The extant Nigerian Constitution promotes religious balance. So, if any political party wants to try Muslim/Muslim ticket, it\u2019s at its own peril. CAN is only forewarning, but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\n\n\n\nCAN said, \u201cthe Presidential running mate of APC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu should be a Christian from the North, Atiku\u2019s running mate should be a Christian from the South while Obi should choose his own among the Muslims from the North\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnything contrary to the above means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of this entity called Nigeria. Those who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse because our fault lines are very visible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no party that has no great, good and patriotic Christians who can preside over the affairs of this nation not to talk of being the Vice President as some mischievous people are trying to say. If merit and competence are used as yardsticks, we have many qualified Christians in all the 774 Local Government Areas of this country,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nCAN said its leadership had tried in vain to get President Muhammadu Buhari to break the monopoly or dominance of the security architecture with people of same faith.\n\n\u201cWe are all seeing the outcome now. It is obvious that the Nigeria of today is different from that of 1993. Our politicians should stop flouting the Constitution by respecting the North and South dichotomy and religious factor. To those arguing that people do not care about the religions of their leaders once they are competent and credible, we dare APC to pick its Presidential running mate from the South and PDP pick its own from the North and see what follows.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the late sage, Papa Obafemi Awolowo picked Chief Mrs Oyibo Odinamadu, a fellow Christian and Southerner, as his runningmate in 1979, we all know the consequences of his performance in the North. Our politicians should be doing what will unite us instead of what will further polarise the country,\u201d it said.\n\nNorthern Christian Elders Oppose Muslim VP\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders Forum also sounded a note of warning that the country\u2019s diversity should be taken into consideration by Tinubu and Atiku while choosing their running mates.\n\nNOSCEF in its Democracy Day message to the nation, signed by its President, Ejoga Inalegwu, cautioned that Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets would be insensitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to all patriotic presidential candidates to avoid manipulative but dangerous and insensitive tickets that will further polarize the nation along religious lines when Nigerians are looking forward, with great expectations for a new dawn, come 2023; a new era and government devoid of politics of exclusion, discrimination and injustice.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the parties therefore, make efforts to meet the deadline for the submission of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, NOSCEF wants to again appeal to political parties to be sensitive to the mood of the nation, the religious diversity of our people and show patriotism by avoiding any action that will throw up our lines of divide, merely to win elections rather than steps that will unite our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that anyone with the credentials to rule this nation from 2023, should be sensitive enough and not be a candidate that would take us back to our religious divides, through the instrument of Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. We do not expect any patriot to, by so doing, again open the wounds for our past bitter religious divides.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need, as a nation, a united front to forge a new Nigeria, that will bring people together across religious divides because we do not lack quality across the religious and regional divides,\u201d it insisted.\n\nThe frontline group said that politicians should make deliberate efforts at avoiding playing the religious cards through such tickets and not turn around to accuse those who condemn their unpatriotic action as the culprits.\n\nBabachir: Muslim-Muslim Ticket Dead on Arrival\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has warned the APC against allowing a Muslim as running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, who is also a Muslim.\n\nLawal, who spoke on a television programme on Thursday pointed out that Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu would have been running mate to the President Muhammadu Buhari, when the latter became the candidate of the APC in 2014 but for the discouragement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThere are concerns that Tinubu, a Muslim, might be forced to pick a Muslim running mate from the North for political prpose.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if it was time for northern Christians allegedly marginalised to be placated with the nomination of one of them as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Lawal said, \u201cI will answer this question in a roundabout way. A political party is in the business of winning elections and to win elections you need to get the votes to beat your opponents. The way I see it is that in choosing your vice-president; that must be paramount in your mind. You can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win elections, it is a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, whatever candidate we are going to choose, we will bear in mind that that vice-president will contribute to winning that election. How does he (or she) continue? It is either he (or she) is popular and can bring in the votes or he (or she) can bring the money that will help our logistics in getting out the votes, so we can win the elections.\n\n\u201cBut then, there is also the requirement that you want to run a united country; you want to run a country where you don\u2019t he friction in the society \u2013 peaceful, settled and everybody goes about their business.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, you must factor in Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities in politics. That is why, for example, in recognition of these peculiarities, the northern governors and the majority of us in the North felt that the presidency ought to shift to the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a requirement in the Constitution that it has to shift. There is no zoning. But it is so we can have a country that is united; that everybody can go about their business in a peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cIt could have been possible for a northern (presidential) candidate to emerge. But then, you would know that running the country in that manner would have the southern part of Nigeria (to be) hostile to that government. So, we allowed it to shift.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, extending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have lived among the Christians and I know that among the Christians, the question of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area. It is dead on arrival. Buhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate (Tinubu) because of the tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket. And we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it has worsened. The religious divide has increased. Tribal divisions have increased. Regional divisions have increased. So, it would be a good thing if APC would settle for a Muslim-Christian ticket because we know (that the) PDP, that is what they would do.\u201d\n\nEl-rufai: Competence Vital, Not Religion\n\nEl-rufai, who was asked to react to the clamour for Christians as running mates of the leading presidential candidates for 2023, declared that competence should be vital in the selection, not religion.\n\nThe Kaduna governor, who spoke on a television programme declared: \u201cYou are asking the wrong person because I don\u2019t look at people from the lens of Muslim Muslim or Christian Christian. Most of my friends are Christians.\n\nIt was Tunde Bakare, a Pentecostal pastor that invited me to CPC, not President Buhari. I don\u2019t think the business of governance has to do with religion, I think we should look for the best person for the job, let\u2019s look for competence, capacity. I am the wrong person to ask because in my state I looked and chose my deputy as a Christian woman. This fixation of Nigerians with religion is worrying.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo: I Will Support Tinubu to Win in 2023\n\nOsinbajo yesterday declared his readiness to give total support Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe also emphasized that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nThe Vice President, who spoke in Abuja at the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidential race, pledged his personal support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who came a distant third in the party\u2019s presidential primary on Wednesday, recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Vice President described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\u201d\n\n\n\nOshiomhole: Tinubu\u2019s Victory a Reaffirmation of His Capacity\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole has described the victory of Tinubu as a reaffirmation of his much-acclaimed unique capacity.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole in a statement issued yesterday said the Presidential candidate of APC represents a movement.\n\nHe noted that he had no doubt that Nigerians, no matter their political persuasions, would readily recognize his unique abilities and accept him as the right person needed at this momentous time, to lead this nation and transcend all extant challenges.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cThis victory is a reaffirmation of your much-acclaimed unique capacity to headhunt, mobilize, motivate and empower the best minds, irrespective of their tribe or religion, and use their combined creative efforts to translate your vision into reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a key asset of leadership that you possess, which over the years has differentiated you from others and positioned you well above your contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou represent a movement, a force, full of energy and radiating hope of a brighter future to come, when Nigerians hand over to you the baton of leadership, which you are well prepared for and ready to accept with all its attendant responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSouth-West APC Congratulates Tinubu, Promises 90% of Region\u2019s Votes\n\nThe APC in the South-West under the chairmanship of Isaac Kekemeke has congratulated Tinubu on his election as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nThe South-West APC in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Ayo Afolabi, said Tinubu\u2019s victory was a proof of his popularity and acceptability all over the country.\n\nThe party said it believed Tinubu\u2019s emergence would translate to victory at the poll and it would bring about the massive turnaround needed by the country.\n\nThe party also assured Tinubu of its resolve to deliver 90 per cent of the region\u2019s votes during the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cWithout doubt, your election demonstrated an overwhelming support from Nigerians across the geo-political zones which was a clear indication that Nigerians want you as their next president.\n\n\u201cThe APC in the South-West stands by you in every step you take in the journey to the Presidency, and we like to assure you that we will deliver the votes of the South-West in not less than 90 per cent of total registered voters in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are one with our governors, National Assembly members, State Assembly members, local governments and indeed all leaders and members of our great party within the South-West region at this movement.\n\n\u201cWe send you our hearty congratulations, and we pray that this will be the beginning of a turnaround for Nigeria in terms of security, economic development, infrastructural upgrading, agric development and housing for the entire population of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all Nigerians to stand up and be counted in this noble movement to build on the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari which will put Nigeria in its proper place in the comity of great nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Aims to make APC guber candidate unelectable\n\n*In retaliation, APC nudges PDP\u2019s flagbearer with EFCC\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State yesterday ordered the prosecution of the immediate past governor of the state, Rotimi Amaechi and the 2023 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Tonye Cole, over their alleged involvement \u201cin the illegal sale of a number of state government\u2019s assets and disappearance of $50 million from the state\u2019s account without proof of where it was deployed.\u201d\n\n\n\nWike gave the order after swearing-in three new commissioners at the Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nThe Rivers State Governor had in 2015 set up a Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi administration and the panel thereafter indicted Amaechi, Cole and some others for corruption.\n\n\n\nWike directed the state\u2019s new Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheus Adangor, to commence prosecution of the two men and the others immediately.\n\nHowever, analysts are of the view that the drive to prosecute Amaechi and Cole is aimed at making the APC governorship candidate unelectable.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce Cole is put on trial, and obviously will be convicted, his drive to become Rivers State governor ends,\u201d said the analysts.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Wike told his new Attorney General: \u201cYou\u2019re at a critical period where people want to know what the state is going to do with the Judiciary Panel of Inquiry after the Supreme Court judgement on it. Luckily, you came at the right time when we had preferred criminal charges against the former governor (Amaechi), Sahara Energy\u2019s Tonye Cole and the rest of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you are coming at the right time to take over the matter and to make sure it is prosecuted diligently. I don\u2019t want to hear excuses. Let the people see what happened to our money. The world will see how $50 million from our account was moved to a company without nothing to show whether there was a business.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor had last month stated that he may file charges against the former Minister of Transportation, following the Supreme Court judgment that dismissed Amaechi\u2019s appeal to frustrate investigation into activities of his administration.\n\n\n\nWike, who spoke during a media parley in Abuja, said the judgement had vindicated the Rivers State Government.\n\nBack then, he promised to meet with leaders of Rivers State to decide on whether to commence criminal prosecution of Amaechi and Cole, over the alleged sales of some valued state assets and diversion of state funds.\n\nThe governor said those whose fate would also be decided included the state\u2019s former Commissioner for Transport, George Tolofari.\n\n\n\nHe explained that on his assumption of office in 2015, the state government set up Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\nWike said: \u201cThe judicial panel was mandated to investigate the sale of the 150 Mega Watts gas turbine in Omoku, Afam 360 MW Gas Turbine, Trans-Amadi 136 MW Gas Turbine and the 75 MW Gas turbine in Eleme; Monorail Project; the sale of Olympia hotel; and non-execution of the contract for the construction of Justice Karibi-Whyte hospital after the Amaechi administration paid $39.2m to the contractor.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Wike yesterday stated that the attempt by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to arrest the state\u2019s PDP governorship candidate, Siminalaye\n\nFubara, would not be accepted, saying that the state government would not hesitate to charge the anti-craft agency for contempt.\n\nWike also directed Adangor to write a strong worded protest letter to the EFCC over the alleged harassment of Fubara.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the protest letter is predicated on the recent attempted arrest by officers of EFCC on Fubara, who he noted before his emergence as the PDP governorship candidate, had served as the Accountant General of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nWike said the era of impunity and flagrant disobedience to the rule of law is gone and his administration will not accept such action by EFCC.\n\n\n\nHe explained that before now, the Rivers State government had gotten a subsisting court judgment against the EFCC that it cannot investigate the state finances or its officers.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, there is also another judgment against EFCC by the PDP governorship candidate to enforce his fundamental rights, which has not been set aside.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also of the view that the opposition APC in Rivers State are in retaliation, going after Fubara with EFCC, to also make him unelectable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean?

          "title": "How Tijan Watt is building a pan-African VC from Dakar",
          "text": "On a windy Thursday evening, in April, a delegation of investors, startup founders, and journalists gathered at the Port of Dakar waiting for the Chaloupe de Gor\u00e9e, a formidable ferry that could hold as many as 340 people, to transport them to the historic Gor\u00e9e Island, where Wuri Ventures, a Dakar-based pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, was hosting its launch party.\n\nAway from the high-end restaurants and 5-star hotels\u2019 seaside bars in Dakar\u2019s city centre where most other events of this nature took place, 45-year-old Tijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Venture, had spefically chosen this Gor\u00e9e Island, which used to be the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, to introduce his firm to the world.\n\nWatt towered over almost everybody else on the chaloupe in a white, Guinea-fabric shirt and black jeans. Even though his beard had nearly gone a solid grey, he was still full of energy, and his eyes were as ambitious as they probably were 21 years ago when he first moved back to Senegal.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWuri Venture is not a new establishment; it\u2019s more than 3 years old. It was first conceptualised through an early advisory business called African Tech Leaders that Watt had founded to advise startups in the process of fundraising and seeking entry into global accelerators like Y Combinator. But Watt told TechCabal that in 2018, he realised advisory alone wasn\u2019t enough to scale the ecosystem, and the idea to start investing in early-stage startups was born. He joined forces with Jerome Cretegny, a seasoned investment professional leading the Senegalese operation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the time. The two combined their personal funds and used that to back promising African founders. In 2019, they incorporated Wuri Ventures, and within a year, the duo made 6 investments.\n\nWatt said that to realise their pan-African ambition, they needed more funds. So they sold 7.5% equity from their general partner equity, bringing 15 top tech and finance operators into the venture. They also partnered with Capria Ventures, which provided Wuri with the credit line it needed to invest, and eventually led to a $1.5 million investment in South Africa\u2019s Whereismytransport $14.5 million series A extension round before the partnership was discontinued. After that, the firm launched a subscription model so that they could pool funds from local and international individual investors\u2014angels, endowment funds, family offices, etc.\u2014using the Angellist Venture platform (It\u2019s the same platform Nigeria\u2019s Future Africa and Kenya\u2019s Mutua Venture use to power their subscription angel investing models.)\n\nA delegation of investors, startup founders, tech operators and journalists admiring and taking pictures of the historical Gor\u00e9e island as the chaloupe approaches the island.\n\nHowever in January this year, Carry1st, a mobile game publishing company Wuri Venture invested in at a very early stage and at a $4 million valuation, closed a $20 million series A extension round from a16z and Google at a valuation of $100 million. This single deal returned double of all the 6 deals they had made over the years. So Wuri exited so that it could be liquid enough to fund other deals.\n\n\u201cWe made some good returns and exited so that we can continue supporting other early stage startups,\u201d Watt told TechCabal.\n\nEven prior to the official launch in April, Wuri Ventures has advised more than 20 startups and invested $2 million across 14 deals including Carry1st, Whereismytransport, Lori Systems, Kotani Pay, Tambua Health, Norebase, Nestocoin and Caytu Robotics amongst others. The firm continues to invest alongside global investment leaders such as a16z, Google, Toyota Tshusho, Avenir Growth and others. Now, Watt believes that its subscription model is going to help ramp up their investment figure from $2 million to $4 million within a year.\n\nWuri Venture also provides incubating programs for founders to learn the ropes of the startup world. Caytu Robotics, one of such startups that incubated with Wuri, recently displayed one of its robots, an Autonomous Delivery Robot, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it was remotely controlled from Dakar\u20146,000 km away from Boston where MIT is located.\n\nFrom Wall Street to selling sugar in Dakar\n\nWatt was born to a Senegalese father and an African American mother. He grew up in Washington, DC where he attended Sidwell Friends School, a prestigious institution that counts Chelsea Clinton and Sasha and Malia Obama among its esteemed alumni. Watt went on to study mathematics and computer science at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nAfter a brief foray into science, running lab tests on both humans and animals, Watt spent 3 years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in New York and London, and in 2001 he decided to move to Senegal.\n\nEven though the dotcom boom had shown signs of bursting in 2000, it didn\u2019t, and the cool kids of Wall Street were still dumping their six-figure salaries to embrace the promise of the digital revolution. Even though Watt saw his colleagues moving to companies like Priceline, he devised a plan instead to move to Africa and become a dotcom pioneer there. How difficult could that be?\n\nTijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Ventures, stands on a makeshift podium to address the guests at the launch event.\n\nIn reality, Watt had only visited Senegal once when he was 18 and knew close to nothing about the landscape. He started to abandon one startup idea after the other: he first wanted to become an internet service provider (ISP) but the \u201cexisting player had a massive capital warchest to kill him on arrival,\u201d he giggled as he narrated this part. After spending a year playing with ideas, he started his own flavoured sugar company in 2002. The company was called Crystal, a name he claimed was inspired by a Notorious BIG song\u2014and that\u2019s how he waltzed off the track of his dotcom ambition.\n\nLike his earlier ISP idea, the Senegalese sugar industry was dominated by The Mimran Group, a French, family-owned company. The Mimran Group owns the Compagnie Sucri\u00e8re S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise (CSS) which cultivates 8,000 hectares of sugarcane in Senegal, and has more than 5,000 employees during harvest time\u2014the largest employer in Senegal after the country\u2019s government. To understand how much money this family made from sugar consumption in Senegal as far back as the 1980s, in 1981, they paid $3 million to acquire Lamborghini and saved the Italian fast car company from bankruptcy. Then they sold it to Chrysler Corporation in 1987 after expanding its model line of product from 1 to 3 in the space of 6 years.\n\n\u201cMy thought then was: since everyone in the country consumes sugar, it\u2019s essentially like a tax on the population,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd then that should not be held in the hands of a single person or that single family.\u201d So at 26, the ambitious Watt took on the Mimran empire.\n\nWatt would build the business into a household name employing nearly 100 people and achieving revenues of $15 million. In the grand scheme of things, that didn\u2019t harm the Mimran\u2019s dominance, but Watt believes that it created a new narrative. \u201cThere is a lot of value in Africa and it\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s the foreigners who are capturing most of it. To some extent, we changed that\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years running the company as CEO, building processes and structure, Watt left to pursue an MBA at Harvard. After that, he worked as an investment officer at Nigeria\u2019s Travant Capital in Lagos, where he stayed for 2 years before returning to Senegal to run Crystal in 2009. Seven years after, Watt finally exited Crystal and moved to Ethiopia to work as the chief revenue officer of mFino, a fintech company providing banks and telcos with mobile banking solutions in major markets in Africa including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal. He stayed at mFino for a little over a year before moving to Silicon Valley in 2017 to start African Tech Leaders, an advisory firm that would morph into Wuri Venture.\n\nSacha Haider, Partner at Global Ventures, and other guests listening to Watt\u2019s speech at the launch event.\n\nThe same hunger still lingers in Watt\u2019s eyes as the ferry approaches the island, prompting guests to pull out their phones and take pictures as they make their way to the Keur Louise, a colonial house dating back to 1864, where the event would happen.\n\nAs the guests, now gathered in the beautiful stone lined courtyard of the historical house, enjoyed a variety of hors d\u2019oeuvres, an artist, sitting in a corner holding his Kora instrument dearly to his chest, blessed the scene with a calming rendition. After the meal, the guest mingled and conversed for a bit. The music stopped and Watt signalled he was making a speech from a makeshift podium. Watt told the abridged version of his entrepreneurial journey, and attempted to sell the crowd on Wuri Venture\u2019s dream, especially its subscription plan, urging them to join Wuri Ventures in building a prosperous Africa one startup at a time.\n\n\u201cWe support the concept of entrepreneurism, which is the notion that through proactive initiative, founders can create positive change in their own societies and can create their own economic opportunities,\u201d Watt said. \u201cThe subscription fund further pushes that vision by empowering individual investors.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu on Saturday, said the commission would soon make its stand known on calls for extension of June 30 deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nYakubu disclosed this while addressing youths in Lagos State at a Mega Musical Concert on \u2018Youth Vote Count\u2019, organised by INEC in collaboration with some partners to awaken youth consciousness toward participating in politics and governance.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the awareness campaign held at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) aim to mobilise and get youths registered in the CVR.\n\nThe exercise started on Monday with the deployment of 50 INEC Voter Enrolment Devices (IVED) to capture youths in the CVR, culminated in the concert which featured several youth-inspiring musicians, comedians and celebrities.\n\nThe campaign was organised by the electoral umpire in collaboration with the EU Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA), International Press Centre (IPC) and other partners.\n\nThe INEC chairman noted that he was aware that the youth wanted their votes to count with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), and assured them that they would get their PVCs while their votes would also count in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that you will have your PVCs. We have new machines which will be deployed all over Lagos from next week.\n\n\u201cI know you want to hear from INEC if we are ending the registration on June 30. We have heard you loudly and clearly, You want time until all Nigerians register for PVCs: you will hear from INEC very soon on that.\n\n\u201cYou want to hear from INEC if you register and vote: will your vote count? Your votes will count,\u201d he said.\n\nNAN reports that at this point, the shout of \u201cno rigging, no rigging\u201d filled the air, chorused by teeming youths at the event, the development which disrupted a bit, the address of the INEC chairman.\n\nResponding to them, Yakubu said: \u201d We heard you loudly and clearly. I listened to you, I listened to you very clearly. Once you collect you PVCs, please go and vote. Vote and not fight.\n\n\u201cLet me assure and reassure you, your votes will count,\u201d Yakubu reiterated.\n\nAssessing the success of the Youth Vote Count campaign which started on Monday, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Lagos state said the commission\u2019s goal of mobilising huge number of youths for the CVR had been achieved.\n\nAgbaje, who said that about 10,000 youths were captured within the five-day exercise, said more voter enrolment machines had been deployed to the 20 local government areas of the state to bring more youths into the voting population.\n\nDecrying that many youths had waited till the 11th hour before presenting themselves for registration, Agbaje urged them to move to their various local government areas to register before the expiration of the CVR on June 30.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that we capture as many of them that are eligible before the end of the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking, the Head of the European Union (EU) delegation to Nigeria, Ms Samuella Isope described the youth turnout as a sign of hope, trust and confidence of youth in the electoral process.\n\nIsope applauded the nation\u2019s new Electoral Act as well as various technologies and innovations that INEC had introduced to make elections more transparent in Nigeria.\n\nThe envoy said that youths needed to be mobilised for electoral processes because they had power to make change happen and make a difference.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up your power. Don\u2019t allow others to be making decisions for you. Come out to register, pick up your PVCs and vote,\u201d Isopi advised.\n\nOne of the organisers, Mr Lanre Arogundade, the Executive Director, International Press Centre, said the current generation of Nigerian youths must take their destiny in their hands by getting involved in the process of choosing leaders.\n\nArogundade urged the youths to join political parties, registering and being active \u201cthis is the only way to change things in this nation. Youths have a civic duty to register and vote in 2023\u201d.\n\nAlso, Mr Samson Itodo, the Executive Director, YIAGA Africa, described as appalling, a situation where Nigerian youths with demographic majority, were not taking part in electoral processes.\n\n\u201cThe young people of Lagos state have a unique opportunity in the next election to make their number count,\u201d Itodo said.\n\nHe encouraged the youths to know that there were reforms within the electoral system that would make their votes to count.\n\nNAN reports that musicians, comedians, and social media influencers among others performed at the event to encourage the youths to get registered, collect their PVCs and vote.\n\nSome of them included: Kizz Daniel; M.I, Teni; Falz; Omawumi; Mayorkun; Waje; JeoBoy; 2Baba; Patoranking; Skiibii; Ashake, Small Doctor; Pasuma, and Bella Shmurda.\n\nOthers were Ufuoma McDermott; Chioma Akpotha; Uti Nwachukwu; Uche Jombo; Lasisi Elenu; Kie Kie; Mr Macaroni; Real Warri Pikin; Omoni Oboli; Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi and Broda Shaggi among other celebrities.\n\nThe only access card to the concert was the PVCs or the Temporary Voter Cards (TVCs).\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe AnyiChuks Campaign Organization, the campaign organization of Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Ebonyi State governorship election, has appealed to party members to close ranks with a view to achieving the much needed liberation of the state in 2023.\n\nThis is as it dismissed claims by Senator Obinna Ogba that he remained the authentic candidate of the main opposition party in the state, warning that the much needed cohesion within the party could not be achieved through \u201cfalsehood or the telling of blatant lies.\u201d\n\nSenator Ogba, chairman of senate committee on sports, who emerged candidate in a now nullified rescheduled governorship primary held on Sunday, June 5, had addressed a press conference on Saturday, insisting that he remained the authentic candidate of the party in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal high court sitting in Abakaliki, had on Tuesday, June 7, nullified the rescheduled primary election, which was boycotted by ad-hoc party delegates, pronouncing it illegal, unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nAddressing Ogba\u2019s claims in a statement on Sunday by its director of media and publicity, Abia Onyike, the AnyiChucks Campaign Organization maintained that the Lagos-based industrialist is the only PDP governorship candidate whose name has since been submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to Onyike in the statement titled, \u2018The Time for Truth and Reconciliation has Come,\u2019 the crisis in the party cannot persist without a resolution and the time to resolve it has come.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish to refer to the Press Conference addressed yesterday, 11th June, 2022 by Sen. Obinna Ogba and to react as follows:\n\n\u201cThe crisis rocking the PDP in Ebonyi state is a self-inflicted logjam which came about because of weak leadership. However, the crisis cannot persist without a resolution and the time to resolve it has come, if the party must rise to the occasion in the state as a liberation movement in the hands of Ebonyi people to rescue themselves from the atrocities of the incumbent APC Government in the state.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of the crisis could be achieved not through falsehood or the telling of blatant lies to the suffering people of Ebonyi. Our teeming members and the ordinary people on the streets need to be told the true situation of things so that they can face the situation squarely and take their destiny into their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governorship Candidate today is Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi. He won the Primary Election conducted by the PDP on 28 and 29 of May, 2022. The 3-man Delegates List used for the Primary Election was the outcome of the State PDP Congress of 7th May, 2022 which was eventually recognised by the PDP National Working Committee(NWC). That Primary Election was properly authorized by the PDP NWC and was peacefully conducted with the INEC mornitoring the exercise in line with the Electoral Guidelines and the 2022 Electoral Act. An attempt by the opposition to cancel the successfully conducted Primary Election suffered a set-back.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Organisation emphasized that the rescheduled primary which produced Ogba was undemocratic, and had been pushed for by forces that didn\u2019t like the fact that Dr. Odii emerged candidate.\n\n\u201cThe parallel primaries conducted on the 4th and 5th of June, was an anti-democratic intervention by some powerful forces who were hell-bent on reversing the popular will of the people. The ruling of the Federal High Court in Abakaliki on 7th June, 2022 restoring the authenticity of the first Primaries which elected Dr Odi was a historic confirmation of the democratic will of Ebonyi PDP cadres as against the dictatorship and imposition by a few Godfathers,\u201d Onyike said.\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of June, 2022, the National body of the Party obeyed the Court Order by forwarding the names of all the candidates elected during the legitimate Primaries of 28 and 29 June, 2022 to INEC and the processing of their forms have commenced.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governorship Candidate in the person of Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi is willing and ready to provide leadership and to reconcile the members of the party after the divisions arising from the internal power struggle.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the Leaders and members of our great Party in the state to embrace the path of maturity and reconciliation at this moment to enable us focus on the common enemy as we gradually approach the 2023 general elections.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that his administration will continue to ensure their protection from both external and internal enemies.\n\nThe president who made the promise in his Democracy Day speech also said he will ensure credible elections in 2023, promising a free, fair and transparent electoral process.\n\nHe pleaded with citizens to support his government in its effort to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nFull Speech Below:\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June the 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u2022 Being an address by President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of the commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day 2022",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has sent an open letter to presidential candidates ahead of the February 2023 presidential election, urging them to urgently publish details of their assets and liabilities, and to publicly commit to rejecting vote buying and electoral bribery before and during the elections.\n\nSERAP said: \u201cWhile there is no constitutional requirement for presidential candidates to publish their assets and liabilities before elections, doing so would show that you can stand up for transparency in assets declaration by public officers if elected.\u201d\n\nIn the open letter dated 11 June 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cThe public office is a public trust. As such, the voters deserve to hear from presidential candidates regarding what they will do about issues of public interest, particularly with respect to integrity, selflessness, openness, accountability, human rights, and the rule of law if elected.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cAs you and your parties prepare for presidential election campaigns, we hope that you will seize the opportunity to show your commitment to addressing these fundamental issues of public interest by immediately publishing details of your assets and rejecting vote buying, intimidation and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part, \u201cPublicly committing to these issues will also show the voters that if elected you would act solely to protect the public interest; and avoid placing yourself under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence you in the discharge of your constitutional duties.\n\n\u201cIt would also show that you would be accountable to the public for your actions and submit yourself to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.\n\n\u201cYour public commitment to these issues will also demonstrate to the voters that if elected you would act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner, and that you would not withhold information from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to show the voters that it will be no business as usual, and to make a public commitment on issues that if addressed would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption and human rights records, and improve access of Nigerians to public goods and services.\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to publicly commit to probing the spending of security votes since the return of democracy in 1999, and widely publishing details of spending of security votes; finding the missing N11 trillion meant to provide regular electricity supply for Nigerians; as well as obeying court orders and the rule of law if elected.\n\n\u201cWidely publishing your assets before the elections would also show your principled stand on transparency and accountability in the management of the country\u2019s resources.\n\n\u201cMaking asset declarations open would ensure that leaders do not abuse their powers for personal gain and allow civil society to hold leaders to account. If leaders are seen to live beyond their means, an asset declaration can be a starting point for investigations.\n\n\u201cThe practice of vote buying and electoral bribery by politicians have characterised elections in the country for many years, preventing political equality and fair electoral competition. Yet, no body politic worthy of being called a democracy entrusts the selection of leaders to a process of auction or barter.\n\n\u201cVote buying amounts to undue influence and improper electoral influence. When politicians buy votes, they reinforce social subjugation and do long-term damage to poor voters.\n\n\u201cPublic officials rarely publish their asset declarations submitted to the Code of Conduct Bureau, contrary to the principles of transparency and accountability, and other international standards.\n\n\u201cImpunity for corruption and grave human rights violations is widely prevalent in Nigeria, as perpetrators are rarely brought to justice. Successive governments, including the government of President Muhammadu Buhari have persistently failed to obey court orders and the rule of law, thereby eroding the citizens\u2019 trust in the judiciary, and violating Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cN11 trillion meant to provide regular electricity supply has been allegedly squandered by governments since 1999. Many unimplemented reports of corruption in the electricity sector continue to gather dust on the shelves while suspected perpetrators continue to profit from their crimes. Socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians continue to pay the price for corruption in the electricity sector\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments and state governors have persistently failed to explain to Nigerians how they spend security votes meant to ensure the security and welfare of Nigerians. In fact, the misuse and embezzlement of public funds in the name of security votes is widely recognized as a major cause of the ongoing security challenges in several parts of the country.\n\n\u201cPlease let us know if you and your political party are willing to commit to some or all of the issues outlined in this letter.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates for Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2023 include: Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP); Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of All Progressive Congress (APC); Mr Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP); Mr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP); and Professor Peter Umeadi of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nOthers include: Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim of Young Progressive Party (YPP); Omoyele Sowore of Africa Action Congress (AAC); Prince Adewole Adebayo of Social Democratic Party (SDP); Mr Kola Abiola of Peoples Redemption Party (PRP); Professor Christopher Imumulen of Accord Party (AP); Dumebi Kachikwu of African Democratic Congress (ADC); and Yusuf Mamman Dan Talle of Allied Peoples Movement (APM).",

          "title": "Running Mate: Tinubu\u2019s Men Rule Out Lalong, SGF, Consider Shettima, Ganduje, El-Rufai",
          "text": "Fresh information emerged on Saturday that the political camp of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has ruled out Governor Simon Lalong and Boss Mustapha- Secretary to Government of the Federation as possible running mate to the ex-Lagos governor in next year\u2019s election.\n\nIt was gathered that the Tinubu\u2019s men might settle for a core Muslim northerner, regardless of Mustapha and Lalong advantage of being Christians. One of those involved in the consultation for Tinubu\u2019s running mate pointed out that the party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nReliable sources close to Tinubu also indicated that the former Lagos State governor would rely on the input of the President Muhammadu Buhari and members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum on who should be his running mate.\n\nThe pressure to pick a Muslim as his running mate, it was learnt, was to assuage his many supporters in the North due to indications that there were no popular Christian politicians to sway votes in favour of the APC in the region.\n\nA source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the sensitive issue, affirmed that four men were in contest for the position. The source said, \u201cWe have Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State; a former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima; Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State; and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that the Governor of Borno State, Prof Babagana Zulum, made a case for Shettima when Tinubu visited the state during his consultation with delegates. Shettima is a strong supporter of the APC candidate and he spoke out in Tinubu\u2019s defence after his Abeokuta outburst.\n\nAnother source noted, \u201cHowever, the President and the members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum will play key roles in deciding the running mate. You will be surprised to know that Zulum made a case for Shettima when Asiwaju visited Borno during the campaign. He said, \u2018Jagaban, please I am going to ask for two favours from you. I want you to pay attention to my state and also consider my principal, Senator Shettima, as your running mate. He has good things to offer and you will enjoy him\u2019.\n\n\u201cFor now, the running mate may have to come from these four men.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that Lalong\u2019s name was dropped because he\u2019s known to be very close to the former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who came second during the primary.\n\nThe source said, \u201cFrom fresh considerations, we cannot pick Lalong or Boss Mustapha. Apart from his closeness to Amaechi, a factor we are not very comfortable with, Lalong is from the North-Central, which is not a core northern state. Plateau is also considered not to be strategic enough to win elections in northern Nigeria. Using him will be like alienating the entire northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cConcerning Boss Mustapha, well, he is not with us. Though he belonged to the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria like Tinubu, he does not identify with him. He was not part of our campaign and has yet to visit the aspirant (as of Saturday afternoon) since he won the primary.\n\n\u201cIn his home state of Adamawa, it\u2019s known that Mustapha cannot win an election there. So, why will you impose such a man on an aspirant that needs the huge votes from the northern region?\u201d\n\nSome stakeholders and chieftains of the APC, on Saturday, urged the party\u2019s presidential candidate to allow the northern APC governors to choose his running mate.\n\nThey argued that since the northern governors suggested that the party should zone its presidential ticket to the South, they were still in a better position to field a running mate.\n\nThe Director-General, Voice of Nigeria and foundation member of the APC, Osita Okechukwu, told one of our correspondents, \u201cOn the issue of the running mate, I will advise our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to weigh the opinion of the northern governors on this matter. They stand in a better position, better than any other organ of the party, in consultation with Mr President to give us a candidate.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the APC Rebirth Group, Aliyu Audu, said, \u201cThe northern governors sat and decided that the ticket should go to the South. The same set of people should be able to decide who will be the running mate. It is not just up to the candidate. It is up to the party.\u201d\n\nThe APC\u2019s first national secretary, Tijjani Tumsah, also stated, \u201cTinubu\u2019s criteria should be competence, a known value addition to the ticket and someone who can deliver. We should not be limited by religion or some other criteria. His criteria should be a competent person from the North.\u201d\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, efforts to reach Tinubu\u2019s spokesperson, Mr Tunde Rahman, proved abortive as he neither responded to calls or an SMS sent to him.\n\nResponding to the rejection of Muslim-Muslim ticket by the Christian Association of Nigeria and counter-claims by the Muslim Rights Concern, the Director, Legal Directorate, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Babatunde Ogala (SAN), told Sunday PUNCH that the APC would not pander to such sentiment.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat is the business of CAN in politics? That is what I don\u2019t understand? Was CAN there when we were doing our convention? Do they know the processes of how our candidate emerged? I think CAN, MURIC and other religious bodies should concentrate on their religion and stop heating up the polity. The party has not come up with any position; so why the issue of threats? What is their own with issuing threats?\n\n\u201cWe will pick the best (running mate) for our party who can deliver the election for us; they should allow the people to decide what they want.\u201d\n\n(PUNCH)",

          "text": "The federal government is working hard to address the lingering security challenges in some parts of the country and ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nThe President said this Sunday in a nationwide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day anniversary in honour of the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola.\n\nThe President stressed the need for Nigerians to be actively involved in the fight against insecurity, saying that addressing security challenges should not be left for the government alone.\n\n\u201cI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n\u201cOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n\u201cFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice.

And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation,\u201d he said.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT\n\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\n12TH JUNE, 2022\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate the freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th, 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th, 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issue-based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue-focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this, however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s overall security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has again said Nigeria and indeed Nigerians, will not forget the sacrifices of heroes of democracy in the 1993 struggles.\n\nHe made this remark on Sunday during a statewide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s democracy day celebration.\n\nRead the full text below\n\nTHIS DEMOCRACY DAY, 2022 SPEECH IS RELEASED TO YOU STRICTLY UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 7.30 AM, JUNE 12, 2022 AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAS READ IT. KINDLY REFRAIN FROM USE ON YOUR ONLINE PLATFORMS OR ANY PLATFORM WHATSOEVER UNTIL THE AFOREMENTIONED TIME.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT\n\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\n12TH JUNE, 2022\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "Some students of Nigerian public universities have expressed frustration over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nASUU has been on strike since February and all efforts to make lecturers return to the classrooms have not yielded results.\n\nSome of the students in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt, appealed to the federal government to meet at least 50 per cent of ASUU demands to end the strike.\n\nA third-year student of the University of Port Harcourt, Greatness Nnamdi, who is studying gas engineering, said that the ongoing strike was impacting negatively on the plans of Nigerian students.\n\nHe said although he enrolled for a five-year programme in 2017, he was still in the first semester of the third year because of the ASUU constant strike and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cMy mates who left Nigeria to study abroad have graduated, some are in their final year and it seems those of us in Nigeria are forgotten.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect students who spent most of their time on strike and who also studied without properly equipped laboratories to come out with good grades or become experts in their fields.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the federal government to put in some efforts to meet the demands of ASUU, at least 50 per cent and this will also make the lecturers not depend on students for their upkeep.\n\n\u201cI plead with the government to bring back hope for Nigerian youths, our plans and programmes are slowing down.\n\n\u201cI also plead with the government to employ young graduates to teach new technologies and innovations in our universities,\u201d Nnamdi-Ikpo said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the University of Calabar, Ms Gift Nwafor, who studying education psychology, said that the ongoing strike had frustrated and setback her studies.\n\nNwafor expressed displeasure at the ongoing strike, saying that the action was leading some students into crime.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am very sad and frustrated. My two siblings and I have been at home since Feb. 14 and our rent for this year would soon expire without being in school.\n\n\u201cMy greatest fear is that some of us have gone into crimes\u2026 They are into theft, raping and consumption of hard drugs.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the federal government and ASUU to consider our future and call off the strike so that we can go back to school,\u201d Nwafor said.\n\nASUU Chairman at the Abia State University, Mr. victor Nkemdirim, attributed the strike to the non-revitalisation of public universities in the country.\n\nNkemdirim told NAN that ASUU was fighting for the revitalisation of the institutions.\n\nHe said since 2009 the government has been unable to implement its agreements with ASUU.\n\nHe said that the government had always reneged on the Memorandum of Understanding and the Memorandum of Action it signed with the lecturers.\n\nHe stated that since the founding of some public universities, the government`s presence there had been minimal, except for projects embarked by the Petroleum Trust Fund(PTF) which came about as a result of ASUU agitations.\n\nNkemdirim said if not for ASUU\u2019s continued struggles, most of the states and federal universities would have gone under by now.\n\nHe also recalled that ASUU had continued to oppose the Integrated Pay Roll and Personnel Information System(IPPIS), a foreign-based platform, which he said the Federal Government was servicing yearly with N7 billion.\n\n\u201cThis (IPPIS) platform contravenes the university autonomy which means that the council of the universities do not have the right to employ or dismiss staff.\n\n\u201cASUU was asked to develop a platform that is congenial to the university system and it came up with University Transability and Accountability Solution (UTAS) which in all tests, including the integrity test, scored 99.7 per cent pass mark.\n\n\u201cWe have also decided to fight for the upgrade of our salaries. We have been receiving the same salary since 2009 while our counterparts\n\nin the polytechnics and colleges of education are earning more than us.\n\n\u201cAll these reasons are why ASUU is still on strike. I, therefore, urge the state and Federal Government to understand that education is paramount to the development of the Nigerian system in its entirety,\u201d Nkemdirim explained.\n\nFunmi Ogundare",

          "text": "Following insinuation that the 2023 general election could be rigged scientifically, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, Saturday vowed that the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot\n\nYakubu has also promised that the commission would get feedback concerning the calls for the extension of the Continuous Voters\u2019 Registration (CVR).\n\nYakubu spoke at a pre-event dinner organised on Saturday by the European Union (EU), where Nigeria\u2019s music stars featured in the Youth Vote Count 2.0 mega concert held at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, interacted with officials of the commission.\n\nHe promised that the electoral body would ensure that all eligible Nigerians willing to register as voters in the current CVR exercise are allowed to do so.\n\nYakubu has also allayed the fears being expressed in certain quarters that the 2023 elections could be rigged, promising that the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nHe debunked the claim that the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) would expire, clarifying that the PVCs have no expiry date.\n\nOn the fears being expressed in certain quarters that elections could be rigged, the INEC Chairman said the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been hearing many stories about \u2018scientific rigging\u2019 or \u2018photochromic ballot papers\u2019 where, according to them, when you thumbprint for a party of your choice, your vote will move to another political party on the ballot paper as it drops inside the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThe best way to protect the sanctity of the ballot is what happens at the polling unit. There are no collation centres where ballot boxes are taken to. The ballot boxes are emptied, sorted out, the votes are counted, recorded on a result sheet, and then uploaded to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV)\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll like to advise all of you to register on the IReV portal. On election day, when voting ends at the polling unit, the results are immediately uploaded to the portal once the processes are completed. We are the first and so far, the only election management body in Africa that does so. We started it in August 2010 with the Nasarawa State Constituency bye-election. So, you can see the result of your polling unit on election day. And since we started, I keep asking: is there any discrepancy between the result uploaded to the IReV and the results given to polling agents at the polling units? I haven\u2019t heard of any. So, be rest assured that we will protect the sanctity of the ballot, first at the most important level, which is the polling unit, and subsequently the results that are collated at the different levels.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman also debunked the rumour making the rounds that the commission was deliberately preventing registrants from a particular section of the country from registering in the current exercise.\n\nResponding to calls for an extension of the CVR due to the surge in the number of young people trooping the commission\u2019s offices across the country to register, Yakubu said: \u201cWe are concerned like all Nigerians. We are appreciative of the fact that young people and Nigerians generally are trooping out in large numbers to register.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a measure of confidence that people have in the system and that is why they are coming out to register. We\u2019ll never let the young people of Nigeria down. Whatever it takes, we will ensure that those who are seeking to register to have the opportunity to do so.\n\n\u201cYesterday in Abuja, we invited all the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) nationwide and we discussed what we can do to ensure that no Nigerian is left out in the current voter registration exercise. What we identified immediately is that we need additional equipment, and we need to create additional registration centres.\n\n\u201cSo, in addition to what we did earlier, the commission has approved 209 additional machines to be deployed to ease the pressure nationwide. And we identified three areas of pressure based on the discussion we had: the entire South-east region; the big apple \u2013 Lagos, and Kano. There is also pressure coming from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). We\u2019ll continue to respond to the pressure.\n\n\u201cFor this concert, the commission deployed 30 additional machines to Lagos, which they used for the CVR exercise since Monday (6th June). These machines are not going back to Abuja. They will remain in Lagos to respond to the pressure.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cINEC will do whatever it takes to ensure that Nigerians can register, vote and we\u2019ll protect the votes cast by Nigerians. INEC is not a political party. The choice of who becomes whatever in Nigeria democratically lies in the hands of Nigerians. Our responsibility is to protect the voter.\u201d\n\nYakubu said the INEC would, within the next one week, observe the effects of the remedies being put in place to ease the pressure and take further action based on the outcome of the observation.\n\nHe urged the music stars to take advantage of their large followership to encourage young people to register, collect their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) and vote on election day.\n\nHe told them: \u201cThere are some things I would like you to please the bear in mind. Messaging is very important, and you are the masters and mistresses of messaging. When you say one thing, a million people will listen to you. But I would have to say the same thing a thousand times before I get 10 people to listen to me.\n\n\u201cThere are three messages I want you to emphasise: Encourage young people to register, but that is only the first step. The second step is that, when they register, they have to collect their PVCs, because registering is one thing, collecting the PVC is another. You can\u2019t go to the polling unit on election day and say \u2013 here I come INEC, I\u2019ve registered. You won\u2019t vote until you have your PVC. Then, they should use the PVCs, come out and vote on election day. The message consistently is to vote, not fight. Register, collect your PVCs and vote. They have a friend in INEC\u201d.\n\nYakubu also debunked another rumour that the PVCs would expire, insisting that the PVCs have no expiration date.\n\nTHISDAY",

          "title": "CBN Unveils Plans to Introduce USSD Code to Improve eNaira",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said it is set to introduce the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) code as part of steps to improve the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nThis development is coming as the National Pension Commission (PenCom) disclosed that Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022.\n\nCBN\u2019s Deputy Governor, Dr Kingsley Obiora, disclosed the apex bank\u2019s efforts to improve eNaira at the IMF African Department Speakers Series held virtually at the weekend.\n\nThe series was focused on \u201cCBDC and Private Digital Payments in Kenya and Nigeria: Challenges and Opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nThe CBN inaugurated the CBDC, also known as the eNaira, on October 25, 2021, aimed at making financial transactions easier and seamless for every stratum of society.\n\nObiora said the introduction of the USSD code became necessary to improve financial inclusion in the country and to ensure people without smartphones could still transact on the eNaira platform.\n\n\u201cWe have made serious progress in the last seven to eight years because when the current governor resumed in 2014, one of the pillars of his vision was to significantly improve financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cSo at the time, we were at 48 per cent of our population within the financial system and given several policies that he conceived and implemented, we are almost at 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with about 30 per cent of our population out of the financial system and we believe the CBDC can help reduce that number even more.\n\n\u201cA lot of people might not have smartphones but that is essentially the next step of our improvement in the CBDC, to introduce the USSD code, so those that do not have smartphones can still transact,\u201d Obiora said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said that the barrier to entry on the CBDC platform was low, which, he said made it possible for everyone with a Bank Verification Number (BVN) to be onboarded into the eNaira platform in a few minutes.\n\nObiora said the value of the country\u2019s digital payments grew from $324 billion in 2008 to about $2.4 trillion presently, adding that Nigerians were now used to digital payments.\n\n\u201cAs you know, within the continent we have one of the largest Fintech companies, Futterwave, Paystack, etc,\u201d the apex bank boss added.\n\nHe said that the CBDC had significant benefits for Nigeria, which was why the CBN decided to introduce it.\n\nObiora listed the benefits to include rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct welfare payments to citizens, and reducing the informal economy.\n\nOthers are improving tax collection, boosting cross-border trade and remittances, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of payments and just endearing economic growth in general.\n\nHe, however, listed some of the key risks to CBDC to include banking sector disintermediation, operational risks of knowing that there is non-stop service, cyber security risks, internet disruptions and financial literacy.\n\nObiora said that Nigeria was doing well based on a PwC report, which showed that the country was number one in terms of adoption, adding that the CBN would keep growing and improving on the system.\n\nSpeaking on adopting cryptocurrency in Nigeria, the deputy governor said for now it would not become part of the country\u2019s financial system because of the volatility that it could create for the system.\n\nCommenting on the high cost of food and fuel in Nigeria caused by the war in Ukraine, he said that the problem was more political than economic.\n\n\u201cWe hope that world leaders will sort this out as quickly as possible because ordinary people who have no egos and did not cause this problem are the ones that are suffering the most.\n\n\u201cWithin Nigeria what we are seeing is that farm gate food prices have either stabilised or reduced, whereas in the market it has increased.\u201d\n\nObiora said a lot of the problems with rising food inflation were due to logistic problems and the issue of higher prices of fuel and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to deal with that by investing a bit in a commodity exchange so that they can stabilise prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cwithin the monetary policy committee, rates will be raised at least to signal that we will continue to keep an eye on inflation and stand ready to do whatever it takes to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAccording to the moderator, Director, African Department, IMF, Mr Abebe Selassie, the series is a platform where Africa\u2019s pressing economic policy issues are discussed and organised by the IMF\u2019s African Department.\n\nSelassie said the series provided an opportunity for policymakers, academics, and analysts to offer their perspectives on economic and policy issues relevant to the IMF\u2019S African constituency.\n\nPFAs Registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts in Q1, Says PenCom\n\nIn another development, the PenCom has disclosed that PFAs registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, according to a statement posted on its official website at the weekend.\n\nThe report showed that the PFAs registered 93,114 RSAs during the quarter under review, which brought the cumulative RSA registrations from inception to 9,621,979 as of March 31.\n\nThe report stated that the total RSA Transfer was 7,663, which was concluded in the first week of April 2022.\n\n\u201cThis covered RSA transfer requests, submitted by PFAs between January 1, and March 31, which were eligible for RSA transfer in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cOut of the total RSA transfers initiated, 5,543 RSAs were transferred to their new PFAs, along with their associated pension assets, while 2,120 transfer requests failed.\n\n\u201cThe failed submissions by PFAs could be attributed to their internal processes, as all the PFAs recorded some failed RSA transfer request submissions,\u201d the report said.\n\nAlso, the report stated that PenCOM received an application from the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), to transfer NSITF contributions, on behalf of 218 NSITF contributors during the quarter under review.\n\n\u201cApproval was granted to transfer N11.53 million to the RSAs of 213 contributors; on a similar note, the commission approved monthly pensions in the sum of N40.47 million to 2,304 NSITF pensioners,\u201d it said\n\nThe report also stated that the compliance by state governments to the status of Implementation of the CPS and other Schemes as of Q1 2022 is impressive.\n\n\u201c25 States of the Federation had enacted pension laws on the CPS, while eight states are at the bill stage, four states adopted the Contributory Defined Benefits Scheme (CDBS).\u201d\n\nPenCom added that it received 11,200 applications from private sector organisations for the issuance of Pension Clearance Certificates (PCCs).\n\n\u201cOut of this number, PCCs were issued to 10,541 organisations, while 659 applications were in the approval process as of March 31.\n\n\u201cThe records showed that the 10,541 organisations\u2019 actions had remitted a total sum of N59,39 billion into the RSAs of their employees, totalling 45,170,\u201d it added.\n\nFestus Akanbi",

But the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai believed that competence should be a major consideration and not religion.\n\nA National Vice Chairman of the party, Dr Salihu Lukman, in a statement issued Saturday said kicking against the Muslim-Muslim ticket was a backward national mindset, which must be changed.\n\nHe said as important as ethnic and religious identities are, addressing challenges facing the country requires that political leaders are not allowed to ride on cheap sentiments of religion and ethnicity to opportunistically win elections.\n\n\u201cIf choices of leaders are dictated by ethnoreligious factors, Nigerian politics will continue to be disadvantageous to many sections of the country. For instance, only Christian Southerners and Muslim Northerners will continue to have advantages.\n\nThe Deputy National Organising Secretary of the party, Hon. Nze Duru told THISDAY that consultations were still ongoing in the party regarding the issue of the running mate.\n\nHe added that it remains the prerogative of the candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu to choose a running mate that would complement his strength.\n\n\u201cWhat is important for Nigeria today is good governance, creating the level-playing field; giving hope to the people of this country,\u201d Duru explained.\n\nOn his part, former National Vice Chairman of APC, South-south, Hilliard Etta, said he did not predicate his politics on religion or ethnic consideration.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf my politics was considered on ethnic considerations.

          "text": "Barring any last-minute changes, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its vice presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will on Tuesday unveil the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is as the All Progressives Congress (APC) is considering the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, from Yobe State; Governors Simon Lalong of Plateau State, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State; and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, from Adamawa State, for the position of the running mate to its presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Amina Mohammed from Gombe State; former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, also from Borno State. A source privy to the horse-trading told THISDAY that a committee had been set up to carefully examine the chances of each of the candidates and make recommendations to the party.\n\nThe source disclosed that Tinubu has said that he has not thought of it.\n\nFor the PDP, THISDAY gathered that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State tops the list of contenders for Atiku\u2019s running mate as the odds favour the South-south geopolitical zone following concerns that the emergence of a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi as the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) will swing the South-east votes in favour of LP.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the pan-Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and their counterparts in the Middle Belt and the Niger Delta \u2013 the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) are awaiting the decisions of the political parties on their choices of running mates before declaring their support.\n\nSome chieftains of the ruling APC have argued that religion should not be a factor in determining the party\u2019s vice-presidential ticket.\n\nThe leadership of the PDP had after the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the party set up a high-powered committee to drive a rancour-free emergence of his running mate.\n\nThe committee convened several discrete meetings where it met with Atiku and other stakeholders.\n\nA source privy to the meetings told THISDAY that \u201cthe committee has met with all concerned and would unveil its choice Tuesday ahead of the June 17 deadline for the submission of the names of the PDP presidential candidate and his running mate to INEC.\u201d\n\nThe source disclosed that the committee narrowed the search for Atiku\u2019s running mate to the South-south geopolitical zone following the concern that the South-east will vote massively for the Labour Party\u2019s candidate, Obi.\n\nHe explained that under this circumstance, the main opposition party now believes that its strength lies in the South-south as it is also believed that the South-west would be a no-go area for the PDP because of the emergence of the former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\nThe source further disclosed that two governors of the South-south, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and one other unnamed governor are the two major contenders for the PDP vice-presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThough the leaders of the party believe that the conduct of the unnamed governor is not befitting of a vice presidential candidate, he is being considered because it is believed that he has enormous financial prowess to finance the PDP presidential campaigns. The governor is unfit for the job and that is why Okowa is at the top of the list,\u201d the source added.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the party has mounted pressure on the governor to accept a ministerial position.\n\nIt was also gathered that the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is ruled out because she prefers to remain in her current position.\n\nThe PDP stakeholders are said to be concerned that the emergence of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) would erode APC and PDP votes in the North-west.\n\nThe source said that the APC had won in all the 44 local government areas in Kano State in 2019 with 1.4 million votes, while the PDP got 391,593 votes.\n\n\u201cWith the rising profile of NNPP, the APC may not have votes again as was the case in 2015 and 2019. So, the party is depending on its stakeholders in the North-west to rein in more votes for Atiku in the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the APC is considering the Senate President, Lawan; Governors Lalong, Bagudu, Buni, Badaru; and the Secretary to the SGF, Mustapha, for the position of the running mate to Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Mohammed; and former governor of Borno State, Senator Shettima.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Mohammed is being considered for gender balancing.\n\nIn a related development, the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu has disclosed that his organisation would meet with Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere and PANDEF after the emergence of the parties\u2019 running mates.\n\nHe said MBF would not be hasty in deciding which political party to support in the 2023 general election, noting that they would study the situation and also watch where the candidates would select their running mates.\n\nPogu, who spoke exclusively to THISDAY, added that there would be alignments and realignments ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said that the MBF consult with Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo to arrive at a decision on which party or candidate to support.\n\nPohu said, \u201cAPC is not the only party that has elected a southern candidate; there are other political parties with Southern candidates. We will sit down and review the situation after the aspirants have all picked their running mates, we shall then meet with our friends \u2013 Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, and arrive at a decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I am saying is that after the choices of running mates, there may be migrations across party lines, and some changes will begin. I say this because Nigerians cannot be taken for a ride.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the volume of people registering now is unprecedented; it has never happened this way before. It shows that Nigerians are up for something.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos",
