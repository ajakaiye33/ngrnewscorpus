          "text": "The Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, alongside seven other governors from Lake Chad Basin, on Monday, met in Younde, Cameroon, to discuss regional security cooperation and a path to improve stability.\n\nThe meeting had six governors in attendance: Zulum from Borno, Issa Lamine of Diffa in Niger Republic; Midjiyawa Bakari of Far North of Cameroon; Abate Edii Jean from North Region of Cameroon; Mahamat Fadoul Mackaye from Lac Province of Chad and Amina Kodjyana Agnes \u2013 Hadjer Lami also from Chad, while governors of Adamawa and Yobe States in northeast Nigeria, were represented.\n\nIn a statement signed by the spokesperson of Borno State governor, Isa Gusau on Tuesday, the meeting was organized by the Lake Chad Basin Commission, with technical support from the African Union, United Nations Development Programme and Crisis Management Initiative, the meeting was hosted by the Cameroonian Government in collaboration with the Lake Chad Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nAccording to Isa Gusau, the meeting which was declared open by the Cameroonian Prime Minister, Joseph Dion Ngute, accompanied by the Mayor of Younde, Mr Luc Messi Atangana, discussed security issues with a focus on terror attacks and humanitarian impacts in the region.\n\nThe meeting also reviewed the implementation of strategies for regional stabilization, which were adopted in 2019, during a similar meeting in Niamey, Niger Republic.\n\nGovernor Zulum in his contributions, tabled Borno\u2019s position, calling on the need to drastically raise the level of trans border cooperation on security before strategic and territorial action plans can work.\n\n\u201cAll these territorial action plans can never be feasible without security, the first thing that we need in the entire region is to address security issues. Especially on the shores of Lake Chad. It is necessary to undertake holistic security operations in the shores of Lake Chad in order to clear the insurgents, otherwise, we are not going anywhere\u201d, Zulum noted.\n\nZulum expressed great concern over the non-utilization of Lake Chad Basin\u2019s shore which he noted, can provide huge economic potentials to benefit the people of the region.\n\nThe Governor called on member states to engage in identifying and addressing the root causes of the Boko Haram crisis and combine measures other than military operations.",

          "text": "A Russian actress and director blasted off to the International Space Station on Tuesday in a historic bid to best the United States to film the first movie in orbit.\n\nThe Russian crew is set to beat a Hollywood project that was announced last year by \u201cMission Impossible\u201d star Tom Cruise together with NASA and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nActress Yulia Peresild, 37, and film director Klim Shipenko, 38, took off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan at the expected time of 0855 GMT, with docking scheduled for 1212 GMT.\n\n\u201cLaunch as planned,\u201d the head of the Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said on Twitter.\n\nLed by veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, the film crew will travel in a Soyuz MS-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the ISS to film scenes for \u201cThe Challenge\u201d.\n\nA live broadcast on Russian TV showed the Soyuz spacecraft ascending into a cloudless sky.\n\n\u201cThe crew is feeling well,\u201d Shkaplerov was heard saying in the broadcast several minutes after take-off.\n\nThe movie\u2019s plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut.\n\nShkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film.\n\nThe ISS crew, which also includes a French, a Japanese and three NASA astronauts, will welcome the newcomers when the hatch opens at around 1410 GMT.\n\n\u2018It was difficult\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was difficult psychologically, physically and emotionally\u2026 but I think when we reach our goal all the challenges won\u2019t seem so bad,\u201d Peresild \u2014 who was selected out of 3,000 applicants for the role \u2014 said at a pre-flight press conference on Monday.\n\nTrue to a pre-flight tradition religiously observed by cosmonauts, the crew said that on Sunday they watched the classic Soviet film \u201cThe White Sun of the Desert\u201d.\n\nShipenko and Peresild are expected to return to Earth on October 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who has been on the ISS for the past six months.\n\nIf successful, the mission will add to a long list of firsts for Russia\u2019s space industry.\n\nThe Soviets launched the first satellite Sputnik, and sent the first animal, a dog named Laika, the first man, Yuri Gagarin, and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, into orbit.\n\nBut compared to the Soviet era, modern Russia has struggled to innovate and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending.\n\nIts space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches.\n\nRussia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry.\n\nRussians \u2018lost interest\u2019 in space\n\nRoscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, costing Russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station.\n\nFor political analyst Konstantin Kalachev, the space film is a matter of PR and a way to \u201cdistract\u201d Russians from the \u201cproblems\u201d that Roscosmos is facing.\n\n\u201cThis is supposed to inspire Russians, show how cool we are, but I think Russians have completely lost interest in the space industry,\u201d Kalachev told AFP.\n\nIn a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia\u2019s space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS.\n\nAfter a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists \u2014 including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa \u2014 to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel.\n\nLast month, SpaceX completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe trip followed the missions of billionaire Richard Branson, who spent several minutes in weightlessness in July, and of Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos completing a similar mission just days later.\n\nLater this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, known for his portrayal of Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, will fly to space on a mission with Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin.\n\n(AFP)",

But we must say that we are shocked and embarrassed that despite the obvious fact that it is only South West that is yet to produce its chairmanship.\n\n\u201cPDP Zoning Committee in plain sight had enough temerity to call the bluff of the entire Yoruba race and the pronounced equity in its party\u2019s constitution and zoned out the same position to the North.\u201d\n\nAlade, who is the spokesperson said \u201cexcept the party, through its National Executive Committee will stop this coup its Ad-hoc Committee orchestrated against the Yorubas, our group and many others shall take the action as a direct threat against our people and shall do everything within the law to protect our interest in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe PDP Zoning Committee had through its release zoned all positions currently occupied by Southerners to the North and all being held by the Northerners to the South.\n\nThough the party\u2019s Zoning Committee\u2019s decision is not the official position of the party, its recommendations are yet to be submitted to the NEC which set it up and have powers to deliberate, amend or ratify whatever the recommendations are.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware that the position taken by the Zoning Committee is not official yet but for it to have released its report without recourse to the NEC that set it up shows there is a sinister plan against the Yorubas in the party and we are right now passing a strong message to the party, that whatever arrangement that will not end with a South West chairmanship shall be viewed as a threat to the political rights of our people who are its members.\n\n\u201cSo, it is left for the NEC to decide on the outcome of its ad-hoc committee that has so much disrespected it, to ease the tension already created\u201d; Alade said.\n\nReacting to the rumor that zoning the party chairmanship was in preparation for its zoning the presidential ticket to the South in 2023, the group said the chairmanship position is first a sure bet than a presidential ticket which will be thrown open to all southern zones and possibly might not be picked by someone from the Southwest.\n\nBut Alade said, \u201cwhat is ours should be given to us now, when we get to presidential issues, then the party can decide whatever will ease the current sufferings in the land.\n\n\u201cWhat if the ticket is eventually zoned to the north which has also labored for the party but by fate only has gotten two years nine months presidential representation out of the party\u2019s sixteen years of being in power, unlike the southern part?\n\n\u201cSo, we know what we are saying by saying that the chairmanship that in all parameters is now the turn of our brothers and sisters in PDP should be given to them.\u201d\n\nThe group also sent words to other political parties to play by the rules of their books in promoting and consolidating democracy in Nigeria and engender brotherhood through political inclusivity.",

Others were Clement Maleghemi, Barrister Robinson Ariyo, Eugene Ikomi, Omolubi Newuwumi and Chief Billy Besi Giwa.\n\n\n\nThe readmission exercise, NDV gathered, would run for a long period. Meantime, the monarch has also formally reconstituted the new traditional Council of Chiefs at his palace in Warri.\n\n\n\nWarri kingdom truly back to its feet \u2014Amtserunleghe\n\nThe Iyatsere, Chief Amatserunleghe, who later spoke with NDV, said Warri kingdom was back on her feet again, adding that the new monarch was poised to take the kingdom to greater heights.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel very happy because Warri kingdom has come back to its feet. In the beginning, Oba Ginuwa, the first Olu of Warri, left Benin kingdom with 70 chiefs to found Warri kingdom in 1480 and Iyatsere Ugbalaka was the first Iyatsere, who led the royal entourage and he was the most senior chief.\n\n\u201cToday, I have been decorated as the most senior chief in Warri kingdom. \u201cThe communities he founded are Ogbe in Ode-Itsekiri, Uba-Uji, what is now Ubeji, Abigbodo, Koko-Duwe,Origin, Obitugbo and Ologbo. He founded all these towns before Ologbo. His children founded Ikara, Ajatiton, Kolokolo Ajoki, and Ajamogha, all these communities by his children are known as Iyatsere communities in Edo state,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHomage\n\nHigh profile Nigerians and political leaders across the length and breadth of the country have been paying homage to the Olu of Warri since his coronation on August 21.\n\n\n\nThe list so far include former President Olusegun Obasanjo, former President Goodluck Jonathan, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, Kogi State Ggovernor, Yahaya Bello represented by his deputy, Mr Edward Onoja, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Minister of Niger-Delta, Chief Godswill Akpabio and so on.\n\n\n\nIn their separate speeches, they all commended the monarch for his brilliant inaugural address shortly after his coronation as the Olu of Warri, wishing him long, peaceful and prosperous reign.\n\nAkpabio\u2019s coronation gift\n\nIn what looks like a coronation gift to the monarch, Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs, Chief Akpabio, during his visit, said his Ministry would commence work on the Koko-Ogheye Road in Warri North Local Government Area from September.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to start the Koko-Ogheye road this September. As the Olu of Warri, our job is to support you to succeed. You will also help us. You handed over Warri kingdom to God, you cancelled all curses, \u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you lifted the curses, it was also lifted on NDDC. Your Majesty, I am one of your sons. May God protect you.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday I join voice with you to pronounce uncommon transformation of Warri kingdom. You have honoured God. Even here during the opening prayers, you removed your crown to honour God, may God protect your kingdom and the rest of us.\n\nNGF promises greater bond with monarch\n\nThe Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, also hailed the monarch on his ascension to the throne of his fore fathers, assuring that they will work with the throne for the common good of the nation.\n\n\n\nNGF chair, Dr. Kayode Feyemi, who spoke when he paid homage to the new monarch, said: \u201cIt is my pleasure and delight to be here before you. On behalf of the Nigerian governors, the 35 of us, apart from myself here. You have received over the last two weeks some individual visits from some of our members. As governors representing the entire federation, we formally present ourselves here to congratulate you and the entire Warri kingdom for God\u2019s presence in this kingdom.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll over the world, we have been honoured as a people. You re invented Nigeria in the eyes of the world during the coronation. We thank God for your coronation. It was most organized \u201c, he said.\n\n\n\nMy reign will promote unity, peace in N Delta \u2013 Atuwatse III\n\nThe Olu of Warri in his separate speeches thanked the visitors, assuring that his reign will promote peace, unity and values of prosperity in his kingdom, the Niger Delta and the country at large. He also offered royal blessings to them as they came.",

We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack. Recall that in May this year, our State Office at Awka was attacked and all the non-sensitive materials assembled for the election at the time were destroyed. In addition, our store, collation centre and the main office building were either totally or substantially damaged. The Commission also lost several vehicles to be used for the election.\n\n\u201cHappily, we have almost fully recovered from that attack. The destroyed buildings have either been completely repaired or are nearing completion and we have fully replaced the materials destroyed.\n\n\u201cThis rapid recovery has only been possible because this is an off-season election. We have sourced some of these materials such as the 326 electric generators and vehicles destroyed in the attack from neighbouring States.\n\n\u201cHowever, should we again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations will be adversely affected\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe wish to assure the people of Anambra State that the Commission is determined to proceed with the election as scheduled. To underscore this determination, the Commission is implementing two more activities on the timetable for the election in the next few days.\n\n\u201cThe register of voters will be presented to political parties in Awka on Thursday 7th October 2021. On the same day, the Commission will publish the final list of candidates for the election.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that at the end of this meeting, we will firm up on specific measures necessary to further guarantee the safety of all persons involved in the election from the voters, election officials, observers, media organisations and the security of election materials\u201d.",

          "title": "Nigerians to face test, isolation as UK rejects COVID-19 vaccine certificate",
          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus with agency report\n\nThe United Kingdom has relaxed COVID-19 restriction for 50 countries excluding Nigeria and other African countries.\n\nThe measure which came into effect yesterday had countries and territories categorised as either \u201cred\u201d or \u201crest of the world.\u201d With the new travel rules, the UK has stopped the previous traffic light system of green, amber and red lists. Nigerians entering the UK will be subjected to COVID-19 test and isolation in spite of their COVID-19 vaccine certificate obtained in Nigeria.\n\nA statement published on its website said eligible fully vaccinated passengers and eligible under-18s returning from the over 50 countries and territories not on the red list, can do so without needing to complete a pre-departure test (PDT), a day 8 test or enter a 10-day self-isolation period, making it easier for those travelling, whether that\u2019s to see friends and family, or on business trips.\n\n\u201cFully vaccinated residents in other countries not yet part of the inbound policy, as well as those partially vaccinated, will still have to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests for day 2 and day 8 after arrival, and self-isolate for 10 days, with the option to test to release after five days.\n\n\u201cThe UK government is continuing to work with international partners as we seek to more regularly expand the policy to further countries and territories.\u201d The statement said that eligible fully vaccinated passengers with an approved vaccine and recognised certificate from a country not on the red list would be able to replace their day 2 test with a cheaper lateral flow test, reducing the cost of tests on arrival into England.Commenting, Grant Shapps, US transport secretary, said:\n\n\u201cWe are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today\u2019s rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector.\n\n\u201cOur priority remains to protect public health but, with more than 8 in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery.\n\n\u201cAlso from today, under-18s from the over 50 countries whose vaccination status the UK recognises will not need to present a negative PDT before travelling to England. This applies regardless of their vaccination status.\u201d\n\nResponding to Daily Sun query over the exclusion of Nigeria from the approved list of countries, the UK High Commission in Abuja said the current approach would be kept under regular review and further changes were likely as part of a phased opening up of international travel for vaccinated travellers. The UK is committed to opening up international travel and we are using our COVID-19 vaccine certification process to enable all those wishing to enter the UK to do so safely.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there has been some frustration that the new UK travel rules will continue to require people travelling to the UK from Nigeria to quarantine despite having received two doses of recognised COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFollowing a pilot with the United States of America and the European Union, the UK is working to recognise vaccine certificates from other countries as part of a phased review of the many COVID-19 vaccine certificates issued across the world. This includes recognising Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certificate and \u2013 in the spirit of our long-term partnership \u2013 we are working with Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to ensure that this happens as soon as possible,\u201d the High Commission\u2019s Political Counsellor, Jonathan Bacon said.\n\nNigerian travelers had in September complained over the COVID-19 restriction they suffered in the UK despite being fully vaccinated before leaving the country. Nigerians were forced to undergo test and isolation even though they had certificate to show for the vaccine that took before traveling. Also, they were made to pay for accommodation for isolation and the test.\n\nFollowing the complaints, the Federal Government assured Nigerians that it was handling the matter. The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Faisal Shuaib, said Nigerian officials \u201care in talks with the UK government.\u201d\n\nHe said all the vaccines administered in Nigeria were recognised by the UK adding that the UK in the past had three classifications for vaccination by countries: green, amber and red of which Nigeria is on the amber list. Shuaib said the new advisory would only see countries classified into two lists green and red and hopes that Nigeria maintains the status quo by not being restricted.\n\nOn her part, the UK High Commissioner to Nigeria Catriona Laing denied reports that her government has placed restrictions on Nigerian travelers. She was confident when she issued a statement that the UK authorities will soon simplify existing travel rules for Nigerians and other international visitors to the country.\n\n\u201cFrom October 4, 2021, the current system will be simplified. There will be a single red list of countries and territories where stricter rules apply, and there will also be a \u201crest of the world\u201d list, with simplified travel measures.\u201d\n\nShe said the \u201crest of the world\u201d list will include countries currently on the UK\u2019s amber list, such as Nigeria.\n\nLaing dismissed as untrue reports suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccines administered in Nigeria are not approved by the UK.\n\nIn the list of countries approved yesterday, no African country was included. Recall that in September, the head of Africa\u2019s health agency had warned that the UK\u2019s policy of not accepting COVID-19 vaccine certificates from the continent could increase vaccine hesitancy.\n\nDr. John Nkegasong, head of the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said the UK\u2019s stance was confusing and had far-reaching implications for vaccination campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe do not understand why the UK has taken this position,\u201d he told a virtual news briefing.\n\nMany Africans are furious, and have called the policy discriminatory. He described the UK policy as \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

I will accept the award on behalf of my officers and men. They are the engine room of NDLEA; they are the ones going to the forests, houses and all corners and crannies of the country to ensure our nation is safe from drug abuse and illegal trade of hard drugs. They go to all the places 24/7 doing the job while we give directions to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we don\u2019t do this job for awards but when they come, we are encouraged by it.

This honorarium from the management of Sun Newspaper will further give me more courage and motivation to perform more.\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank the Board of Editors of the Sun Newspaper enough for chosing me and using the platform to educate Nigerians on how we operate because there are always misconceptions especially on the situation of COVID-19 in our orientation camps.\n\n\u201cSome claimed that there are positive cases in our camps but your platform has continued to sensitise the public on the real situation.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Onuoha commended Ibrahim and Marwa for distinguishing themselves in their national assignments.\n\nHe explained that they were chosen as winners of The Sun Public Service Award 2020 because of excelling in their various works\n\nHe said The Sun Board of Editors sit together to talk about Nigerians who have exceptionally done well in the area of public service.

          "title": "Fiscal Federalism: Lagos Demands 1% in Revenue Allocation Formula",
          "text": "\u2022Sanwo-Olu reiterates demand for special status\n\n\u2022Says prosperity of Lagos has multiplier effect on S\u2019West, Nigeria\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Government yesterday demanded one per cent share in the federal revenue allocation formula, maintaining that the state\u2019s unique features and its prosperity bear on development in the South-west and Nigeria, generally.\n\nThe government canvassed a special status designation for Lagos State, and proposed that the revenue sharing formula should be 34 per cent for the federal government, one per cent for the Federal Capital Territory, 42 per cent for state governments, 23 per cent for local governments, and one per cent for Lagos State (Special Status). This is against the current revenue allocation formula, which gives the federal government 52.68 per cent, the 36 state governments 26.72 per cent, and the 774 local governments 20.60 per cent.\n\nThe Lagos State government\u2019s demands were made by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the opening of a two-day South-west zonal public hearing on review of the revenue allocation formula, organised in Lagos by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nIn a memorandum on review of revenue allocation formula, which he submitted to the RMAFC, Sanwo-Olu declared that allocating one per cent to Lagos State (Special Status) and allowing the three tiers of government to share 99 per cent in a new revenue sharing formula was straightforward, self-justifying and in no way controversial. He said the review of the current revenue allocation formula was long overdue, stressing that the best way to guarantee national progress and development is to pay attention to sub-national development since the national is a summation of the sub-national.\n\nThe governor reiterated the call for Lagos State to be accorded special status in recognition of its huge financial commitments to infrastructure and provision of basic amenities for the increasing population of residents, as well as its preeminent contribution to the national coffers. He said the call, which had been re-echoed at different forums, could not be overemphasised, especially against the backdrop of the current economic situation of the country, the aftermath of the EndSARS protests, and the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which Lagos had been the national epicentre.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOur demand is a sharing formula that is just, fair and equitable; reflecting the contribution of stakeholders to the common purse; and also one that enhances the capacity of state and local governments to deliver high-quality services and the full dividends of democracy to the greatest number of our people.\n\n\u201cLagos State is, no doubt, the nation\u2019s commercial capital, and population centre. The level of funding required to service the state\u2019s social and public infrastructure is so significant that it will be difficult for the state to bear the burden for much longer under the present arrangement.\n\n\u201cI should say that it will actually be unfair to expect the state to bear this heavy burden on its own. It is, therefore, necessary to give due consideration to all the variables that support our advocacy for a special status.\n\n\u201cThe call for a special status for Lagos is not a selfish proposition; it is in the best interest of the country and all Nigerians, for Lagos which accounts for about 20 per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and about 10 per cent of the nation\u2019s population to continue to prosper.\u201d\n\nFurther defending the demand for special status, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos was more than just another state in the Nigerian federation, saying there is no tribe in the country without significant stake in the state.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the former capital of the country for 77 years (compared to the 30 years that Abuja has been the Federal Capital Territory), Nigeria\u2019s largest metropolis still bears the heavy brunt of being home to all Nigerians; irrespective of age, class, gender, religious affiliation or tribe.\n\n\u201cThere are several statistics that show the number of people that come into Lagos every day, however, there are clear indications that most of these people migrate with the intention to make Lagos their new home and in pursuit of personal dreams due to the opportunities the city-state seemingly possesses, and this portends additional responsibilities on the government.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Lagos still harbours a huge number of federal establishments, which could not be moved to Abuja. These include military cantonments and barracks, Police, Customs, Immigration, Civil Defence, Prisons, Road Safety and security/intelligence establishments.\n\n\u201cThere are several reasons to justify the call for a special status for Lagos apart from the aforementioned factors and by extension, a review of the Revenue Allocation Sharing Formula.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu also said it would be unfair for Lagos to be left alone to bear the burden of the massive destruction experienced by the state during the EndSARS protests, which were hijacked by hoodlums, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis month marks one year after the massive destruction experienced by the state in the violence that accompanied the hijacking of the EndSARS protests. Public buildings were burnt down, and historical infrastructure destroyed.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we have put that experience behind us and forged ahead, the reality of this unfortunate incident remains with us; resources that should be committed to other areas of need are now being used for the restoration of these public facilities. It will be totally unfair for Lagos State to be left alone to bear these huge expenses without assistance from the centre.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 pandemic is another issue that has once again, supported the justification for Lagos to be accorded the privilege of a special status. As much as this affects the entire country, it is a fact that the degree of havoc caused by this virus differs from state to state.\n\n\u201cLagos was the epicentre for this virus, the same way it was for the Ebola virus some years ago. The management of these unforeseen occurrences comes with huge responsibilities and financial commitments on the part of the state government.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu commended the chairman and members of RMAFC for taking the bold step of reviewing the revenue allocation method, which he believed would, \u201cresult in a fundamental alteration of the current revenue sharing formula, in favour of one that is truly fair and equitable, and that takes into full consideration the specific and more pragmatic fiscal contexts of the sub-national governments of the federation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urge FG to constitute NDDC board by law, demand forensic audit report be made public\n\n\u2022Set to commission regional security outfit\n\n\u2022S\u2019East govs, leaders to meet over rising insecurity\n\n\u2022Obi: Situation is disheartening\n\n\u2022Gunmen enforcing stay-at-home order set tricycle ablaze in Enugu\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Gideon Arinze in Enugu and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nSouth-south Governors Forum, yesterday, declared support for states\u2019 collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) as ordered by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt. The forum, comprising governors of the six oil-rich Niger Delta states of Rivers, Edo, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, and Delta, made the declaration after a closed-door meeting at Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governors\u2019 decision to join the suit currently before the Supreme Court was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 presented to newsmen by Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThe forum urged that in constituting the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), the federal government should follow the law establishing the commission. They demanded that the NDDC forensic audit report should be made public.\n\nThe governors regretted the federal government\u2019s failure to honour an understanding regarding the relocation of the headquarters of subsidiaries of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the international oil companies (IOCs) to the Niger Delta. They called for the completion of federal projects in the region.\n\nThe governors said they had established a regional security outfit that would be launched soon, adding that the National Assembly, in amending the Petroleum Industrial Act, should seriously consider the interest of the communities hosting the oil and gas activities.\n\nIn a related development, governors and leaders of the five South-east states scheduled an emergency meeting today to address rising insecurity in the zone. That was as former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, decried the level of insecurity in the zone, describing the situation as disheartening.\n\nBut former National Publicity Secretary of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party\n\n(PDP), Chief Olisa Metuh, said the South-east leaders should demand at their meeting the release of detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, saying this is a sure step towards tackling the security challenges in the zone.\n\nThe situation in the zone remained tense yesterday, as gunmen enforcing a weekly stay-at-home order set ablaze a tricycle in Enugu State for disobeying the order.\n\nSouth-south Governors\u2019 Forum met at the conference room of Rivers State Government House, Port Harcourt, and the meeting was chaired by Okowa, with the governors of Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo, Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom in attendance. The governor of Cross River State, Professor Ben Ayade, who recently defected from PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), was absent at the gathering.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting, and read by Okowa stated, \u201cAfter an extensive deliberation, Council, bearing in mind that most of the BRACED states have established their state security organs, approved the regional security architecture, which would be launched soon.\n\n\u201cUnequivocally supports the decision for states to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and resolved to join the suit before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cUrge the president and the National Assembly to take necessary measures to review some unfair aspects of the recently signed Petroleum Industry Bill to ensure fairness and equity. It urged that the amendment should include a clear definition of host communities and that the trustees should be appointed by state governments.\n\n\u201cCalled upon the president and the federal government to uphold the law establishing the Niger Delta Development Commission by appropriately constituting its Board. In addition, it expressed the hope that the federal government would make the forensic audit report public and deal justly and fairly with the report with a view to strengthening the capacity of the NDDC to meet its obligations to the people of the region.\n\n\u201cRegretted that the president and the federal government had generally failed to give reasoned consideration to requests made by the region during the dialogue with a special federal delegation led by Professor Ibrahim Gambari, Chief of Staff to the President. Notable among the requests were the relocation of NNPC subsidiaries and IOCs headquarters to the Niger Delta and the completion of a number of federal projects in the region, notably, roads.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the South-east governors and leaders meeting holding today at Enugu State Government House would be expected to discuss measures to address the lingering security challenges in the zone. Recent escalations in the security crisis had led to several deaths, including the killing of renowned medical doctor and widower of the late Professor Dora Akunyili, former director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dr. Chike Akunyili, in Anambra State. The governors were also expected to discuss the prolonged incarceration of Kanu.\n\nA memo sent to newsmen by the Ebonyi State Governor and Chairman, South-east Governors\u2019 Forum, David Umahi, showed that the leaders would reach some decisions to salvage the region currently battling high insecurity.\n\nUmahi appealed to the governors and other leaders from the zone to endeavour to be present and not in a representative capacity.\n\nHe wrote in the memo, \u201cYour Excellences and our highly esteemed leaders, in consultation with our governors and President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, where a decision for an urgent meeting to be called was reached, may I therefore invite you for an emergency meeting of South-east governors, some leaders of Ohaneze, some of our political leaders, some of our religious leaders, and some of our traditional leaders.\u201d\n\nObi, worried about the situation in the zone, said there was need for an urgent stakeholders meeting to discuss salient issues pertaining to the wave of violence in the region. In a news release by his media aide, Mr Valentine Obienyem, the governor called on the different political, religious, traditional leaders, and other stakeholders of South-east to come together and tackle the monster of insecurity currently contending with the peace of the region and the unity of the Igbo.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe can no longer sit and wish away the unacceptable killings and violence raging through our region. We, Igbos, are not known for violence and disrespect for human lives and must not allow the urge for bloodbath to creep in among us. The sit-at-home order that has persisted in the South-east heavily bears down on the regional economy.\n\n\u201cThe urgent need for stakeholders meeting is, therefore, inevitable. This is the time for every leader in the region to unite and, in unity, address the challenges of insecurity facing us, before we are all consumed.\u201d\n\nObi reminded south easterners that crime fighting required collective efforts, urging them to remain committed to the peace and development of the region. He encouraged them to eschew crime and pursue productive ventures that will better their lives and bring development to society.\n\nOn his part, Metuh submitted that the release of Kanu would not only douse tension in the region but also put an end to allegations and counter-allegations regarding those behind the escalated insecurity in the zone and give the security agencies a clearer cue to track down the perpetrators.\n\nA statement by Metuh said, \u201cThis call is coming on the backdrop of denials by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of involvement in the recent killings, arson and other acts of violence in the South-east; and particularly in the face of allegations that the attacks were being sponsored by external, political and criminal interests.\n\n\u201cThe authorities should, therefore, use the release of Nnamdi Kanu to eliminate the current puzzlement and complications as well as a political solution for situations that constitute unrest in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative for our governors and leaders to use this meeting to impress it on the federal government to adopt a political approach by releasing Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nMetuh reiterated that Kanu, \u201can Igbo man and our son, has not stolen nor has he killed anyone and, hence, we must stand for him as our son.\u201d\n\nHowever, Metuh urged the youth in the zone not to allow themselves to be used by criminal and political elements to destroy the region for their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cWe must all be vigilant, circumspect in our utterances and place our hands on the deck for solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stay-at-home order continued in the South-east, though, IPOB had repeatedly said the exercise had been suspended.\n\nStreets and major roads in Enugu were deserted in compliance with the order, which many residents have condemned and told IPOB to seek other ways of protesting the detention of Kanu. The threat driving the order was intensified yesterday, when some gunmen set ablaze a tricycle, alleging that the owner flouted the order.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Operation to target militants, bandits, armed robbers, others\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nThe 81 Division of the Nigerian Army on Monday launched Operation Still Waters, a joint operation aimed at combating kidnapping, armed robbery, banditry and other crimes within Lagos and Ogun States which are its Areas of Responsibility (AOR).\n\nAt the launch in Lagos, troops deployed for the exercise were charged to be ruthless with criminals disturbing the peace and security of both states.\n\nHowever, they were mandated to respect the rights of law abiding citizens and adhere to the rules of engagement guiding the field exercise.\n\nAccording to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division, Major General Lawrence Fejokwu, residents of both states should expect increased military presence both during the day and at night till December 23 when the exercise would be concluded.\n\nHe said during Operation Still Waters, formerly codenamed Exercise Crocodile Smile, troops were expected to practice what they had learnt in the classrooms to better prepare them on how to tackle criminal elements.\n\nFejokwu said: \u201cWe have rules of engagement therefore, lawful citizens have nothing to fear but if we find criminals in the course of conducting the exercise, we will deal with them accordingly.\n\n\u201cThere would be increased military movement by day and night and I urge law abiding citizens to go about their business without any fear.\n\n\u201cAll we are trying to do is to work in synergy, carryout rehearsals and be sure of what we want to do so that when we have to conduct raids in the future such as cordon and search operations, all services will be on the same page and we will do it together the way it should be done because we have rehearsed it and because we know what each service ought to do in any given situation.\n\n\u201cIf we also have the security agencies on the street conducting exercises it would go a long way at deterring criminal activities in our society.\n\n\u201cWe expect hightened security awareness and that citizens in the course of this exercise can report any case to the nearest field location which are evenly distributed in the state. We are using our gun boats to patrol the waterways and deploying our own soldiers on the banks of so many jetties.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Commander 9 Brigade, Brigadier General Lander Saraso said the participating troops have been briefed to be friendly, civil with law abiding civilians but deal ruthlessly with criminals terrorising the society, within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe said the exercise would practice the troops in certain aspects of counter terrorism/counter insurgency operations in the states, adding that its headquarters was sited at the Digital Bridge Institute, Oshodi, because it was close to some identified flash points such as Oshodi Isale.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is designed to curtail the activities of militants, bandits armed robbers, cultists, hoodlums, illegal oil bunkers and the likes within Lagos and environs.\n\n\u201cRecent intelligence report available revealed unprecedented wave of criminalities going on within our environs with criminal elements who have taken over some communities to perpetuate their criminal acts.\n\n\u201cIn spite of efforts of security agencies, these criminal elements have continued to engage in criminal activities such as kidnapping, armed banditry, militancy, cultism and other violent criminalities within the city of Lagos.\n\n\u201cIn view of these criminal activities and as it is customary in the Nigerian Army, the brigade was tasked to conduct this exercise to curtail these criminal activities in conjunction with other sister services and security agencies as we approach the yuletide season.\n\n\u201cThe concept of the exercise involves the physical deployment of troops in the field from where this troops are going to be dispatched from time to time to conduct real time patrols against criminal elements within the environment.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is intended to achieve the following objectives: To practice units and sub-units under command on the concept of forward operation bases and brigade headquarters in the field; test the unit and sub-unit commanders in battle procedure and decision making processes regarding deployment of weapons and assets in internal security operations.\n\n\u201cTest commanders and staff at the brigade level including combat support and combat service support elements in the act and conduct of logistical operations and combat support service procedures in internal security operations; test ability of troops on communication skills and communication security in an operational environment.\n\n\u201cTest unit and sub unit commanders aspect of counter terrorism and counter insurgency operation, and test unit and sub unit commanders on inter service core operation and cooperation with other sister agencies in military operations other than war\u2026\u201d he said.\n\nSaraso said the ability of unit and sub unit commanders to handle the press during internal operations would also be tested, adding that they would be exposed to the levels of service support available to them at the tactical level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The third bloodiest day of the year after February 5, was March 2.\n\nOn this day, over 50 people were killed in Igabi local government in Kaduna State.\n\nA witness to the attack said newborns and almajiris were not spared in the carnage.\n\nThe witness said the bandits, whom he kept describing as Boko Haram, stole nothing and even cremated some of the persons they had already murdered.\n\n20 days later, bandits expressed their fearlessness, killing 29 security officials made up of the army, the police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps in Niger State.\n\nThe area of Niger where the engagement happened is close to the Birnin Gwari Local Government where the bandits hold sway.\n\nIn April\n\nLife Count recorded 183 deaths in the fourth month of the year.\n\nThe bloodiest day was April 19.\n\nBandits invaded a village in Katsina State, killing 34 and carting away as much foodstuff as their 200 motorcycle cavalcade could carry.\n\nA source said the raiders came for the government palliatives given to the residents whose lives have been under the grip of the killers and rustlers.\n\nSix days before that, two communities in Taraba State continued their feud over some ancestral fishing ponds, 25 persons were killed in the latest episode of the communal clash.\n\nPrior to both attacks, bandits raided Sokoto, another North-Western state.\n\nThe attack which left 22 persons dead, is said to have lasted for three uninterrupted hours.\n\nIn May\n\nMay was the third bloodiest month of CML\u2019s Life Count collation.\n\nAbout 252 persons were killed in 35 reported incidents.\n\nThere were three incidents with deaths over 20 and above during this 31-day period.\n\nThe most brutal of them was the murder of 74 persons in Sokoto State.\n\nThe raid on Sabom Birni came just a day after the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, paid a visit in company with his security chiefs.\n\nThe other two major attacks were 20 each in Kaduna and Borno.\n\nIn June\n\nAfter February\u2019s 460 was June\u2019s 395.\n\nIn this month, a village in Borno State was completely raised to the ground by an armed group not labeled as Boko Haram.\n\nOn June 10, the group killed 81 persons, who were herding their cattle in an open field.\n\nThose, who tried to escape the shooting were run down with vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nThe village head was kidnapped, before the village itself was burnt down.\n\nFour days after that, Boko Haram/ISWAP killed 40 civilians and 20 soldiers in the same state.\n\nThe same day, Felo Village was burnt, 50 persons were killed in five villages in Katsina.\n\nThe attack was linked to bandits.\n\nThe National Assembly, which is dominated by representatives from the Northern region of the country, have asked the President to freshen up the offices occupied by his service chiefs.\n\nIt is a request the President has not deem fit to agree to.\n\nMany of the communities being attacked are agrarian in nature.\n\nFarmers in these places are finding it impossible to earn a living.\n\nObservers feel Nigeria\u2019s food import bill will continue to soar if it cannot till all the hectares of farmland available to it due to the incessant bloodshed across the country especially in the Northern region.",

          "text": "A Civic Media Lab collation of media reported deaths in Nigeria for the first six months of 2020 ranks Kaduna State as the part of the country with the highest report of murders.\n\nIts record of 493 persons killed between January and June, is higher than the reported deaths in the Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorised territories of Borno; 290, Adamawa; 37 and Yobe; 5.\n\nThere were more persons kidnapped in Kaduna State \u2013 178 than any other part of the country based on the reports collected by CML.\n\nThis is in contrast to the 10 recorded incidents of kidnapping in Borno.\n\nIn keeping with the increasing trend of attacks organised by loosely defined marauders called bandits by the media, the motorcycle-riding killers and cattle rustlers were responsible for at least 566 of the 1,692 deaths shown in the Life Count data.\n\nThis is three times more than the 130 attributed to Boko Haram and its ISWAP fraction.\n\nThe Life Count data collated 185 incidents and 55 of these were pinned on bandits.\n\nThis again was more than the eight reports labelled as Boko Haram attacks and the three committed by ISWAP.\n\nBoko Haram was more deadly with their attacks, killing an average of 15 persons per foray.\n\nCombined with the nine deaths from three strikes by ISWAP, the rate drops to 11.8.\n\nThe bandits, on the other hand, had a murder rate of 10.3 deaths with every attack.\n\nWhile killings by herdsmen are not dominating the headlines, the Life Count data recorded about 29 raids, which led to 148 deaths.\n\nThe majority of the deaths carried out by herdsmen as collated by Life Count, were from Kaduna \u2013 63 not from Benue \u2013 26.\n\nOutside the Northern region, the cattle breeders were accused of killing 21 persons in Delta, the highest death toll from herdsmen attacks in the South.\n\nThe most fatal of the 185 incidents reported though, was the 250 deaths recorded when the police took on the well-fortified bandit headquarters in Birnin Gwari in Kaduna.\n\nAsides from the 250 deaths most of whom were reported to be on the side of the terrorists, CML\u2019s Life Count collated report showed that police officers were involved in 18 extra-judicial killings.\n\nThe army increased that number to 22, with four murders, while trying to enforce COVID-19 lockdowns in a community in Taraba State.\n\nThe police raid on the bandit HQ, painted February crimson.\n\nThat sole incident contributed to more than half of the deaths in the bloodiest month of the year so far.\n\nIn January\n\nIn the first month of the year, there were 181 deaths.\n\nAlthough this month had the lowest number of recorded deaths according to the CML Life Count data, it would be remembered for three attacks.\n\nOn January 6, Boko Haram detonated an improvised explosive device on a bridge in the border province of Gamboru in Borno State, killing 30 and injuring 35 others.\n\nEight days later, bandits attacked the convoy of the Emir of Potiskum in Yobe State, killing 30 and kidnapping a staggering 100 persons.\n\nA week later, the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Adamawa State, Lawal Andimi, was beheaded by the ISWAP faction of the Boko Haram militants.\n\nISWAP had ceremonially killed 11 Christians in December, saying they would launch a campaign against Christians in Nigeria, in 2020, as retribution for the killing of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, by the USA.\n\nIn February\n\nThere were 460 deaths in that month, the highest death-rate in the first six months of 2020.\n\nThe first major incident was on February 5, when the police raided bandits at Birnin Gwari.\n\nThe police were surprisingly engaged by a well-supplied band, who attacked the security force\u2019s air team with anti-aircraft guns.\n\nThe death toll of 250 was the most violent recorded this year so far.\n\nFive days later, Boko Haram made a signature raid, killing 30 defenceless passengers.\n\nThey were camped outside Maiduguri because they missed entering the city before the 5:00pm curfew.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, the marauding band terrorizing the North-West, showed a glimpse of what residents in certain parts of Katsina were to face, killing 33 in a raid on two villages.\n\nIn March\n\nLife Count recorded 180 deaths in March. The third bloodiest day of the year after February 5, was March 2.\n\nOn this day, over 50 people were killed in Igabi local government in Kaduna State.\n\nA witness to the attack said newborns and almajiris were not spared in the carnage.\n\nThe witness said the bandits, whom he kept describing as Boko Haram, stole nothing and even cremated some of the persons they had already murdered.\n\n20 days later, bandits expressed their fearlessness, killing 29 security officials made up of the army, the police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps in Niger State.\n\nThe area of Niger where the engagement happened is close to the Birnin Gwari Local Government where the bandits hold sway.\n\nIn April\n\nLife Count recorded 183 deaths in the fourth month of the year.\n\nThe bloodiest day was April 19.\n\nBandits invaded a village in Katsina State, killing 34 and carting away as much foodstuff as their 200 motorcycle cavalcade could carry.\n\nA source said the raiders came for the government palliatives given to the residents whose lives have been under the grip of the killers and rustlers.\n\nSix days before that, two communities in Taraba State continued their feud over some ancestral fishing ponds, 25 persons were killed in the latest episode of the communal clash.\n\nPrior to both attacks, bandits raided Sokoto, another North-Western state.\n\nThe attack which left 22 persons dead, is said to have lasted for three uninterrupted hours.\n\nIn May\n\nMay was the third bloodiest month of CML\u2019s Life Count collation.\n\nAbout 252 persons were killed in 35 reported incidents.\n\nThere were three incidents with deaths over 20 and above during this 31-day period.\n\nThe most brutal of them was the murder of 74 persons in Sokoto State.\n\nThe raid on Sabom Birni came just a day after the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, paid a visit in company with his security chiefs.\n\nThe other two major attacks were 20 each in Kaduna and Borno.\n\nIn June\n\nAfter February\u2019s 460 was June\u2019s 395.\n\nIn this month, a village in Borno State was completely raised to the ground by an armed group not labeled as Boko Haram.\n\nOn June 10, the group killed 81 persons, who were herding their cattle in an open field.\n\nThose, who tried to escape the shooting were run down with vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nThe village head was kidnapped, before the village itself was burnt down.\n\nFour days after that, Boko Haram/ISWAP killed 40 civilians and 20 soldiers in the same state.\n\nThe same day, Felo Village was burnt, 50 persons were killed in five villages in Katsina.\n\nThe attack was linked to bandits.\n\nThe National Assembly, which is dominated by representatives from the Northern region of the country, have asked the President to freshen up the offices occupied by his service chiefs.\n\nIt is a request the President has not deem fit to agree to.\n\nMany of the communities being attacked are agrarian in nature.\n\nFarmers in these places are finding it impossible to earn a living.\n\nObservers feel Nigeria\u2019s food import bill will continue to soar if it cannot till all the hectares of farmland available to it due to the incessant bloodshed across the country especially in the Northern region.",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Founder\u2019s Table monthly series, where we catch up with founders in the startup ecosystem, learn about their failures, successes and a few tricks of the trade.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he founded Patricia, CEO Hanu Fejiro Agbodje says he tried and failed at 13 businesses, all of which, in his words, \u201cended in tears\u201d.\n\nThe businesses ranged from a commercial bike business \u2014 in which his employee carted away with the bike \u2014 to a thriving fast-food joint with 3 in-campus locations that got him arrested and almost expelled from the University of Port Harcourt.\n\nToday, his barely 4-year-old alternative payment solutions platform, Patricia employs over 300 people around the world. But Agbodje is never quick to dismiss his humble entrepreneurial beginnings.\n\n\u201cMy failed businesses gave me so much first-hand experience that in the first two years of running Patricia, there was barely any challenge that was new to me,\u201d he told me during a recent chat at the Patricia Universe office in Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about everything from his entrepreneurial journey, to how the Bible inspires him to make bold moves, to why Patricia recently moved its headquarters to Estonia, and plans for the future.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nNB: Below is a paraphrased (for clarity) and summarised version of the interview. For the best experience, we recommend watching the video above.\n\nM\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 of Techpoint Africa (MM): What was the inspiration for building Patricia?\n\nHanu Fejiro Agbodje of Patricia (HFA): I have a journal where I write all my ideas in, no matter how stupid or dumb they seem. Patricia happened to be number 37 on that idea book. To be honest, I just wanted to make extra \u20a630,000 (~$84 in 2017) a month. That was the plan; I wasn\u2019t looking to build anything elaborate. I was just trying to survive\n\nMM: But what gave you the conviction that Patricia was the right idea to build on?\n\nHFA: I didn\u2019t give it that much thought. I was only trying to avoid running out of money while staying with my brother in Lagos. I had about \u20a61m (~$2800 in 2017) in my bank account and everyday, the money kept reducing. By the time it got to about \u20a6800,000 ( ~$2240 in 2017), I knew I had to act fast or we\u2019d be flat broke in another 1 to 2 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I picked up my idea book and of all the ideas, Patricia seemed like the only viable thing that would be low cost but guarantee me returns of at least \u20a630,000 (~$84 in 2017) monthly.\n\nMM: Why the name \u201cPatricia\u201d though?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHFA: When I had the idea for Patricia is 2015, I was in my grandad\u2019s house. My grandad and my mum had something of a love hate relationship. My mum\u2019s name was Patience but for some reason, my grandad always insisted on calling her Patricia, which would often lead to an argument.\n\nIt was on one of such days that I had my random business ideas and I was like, \u201cOkay. Number 37 \u2014 Patricia\u201d. I didn\u2019t think much about it.\n\nMM: What lessons did you learn from your 13 failed businesses before Patricia?\n\nHFA: I think one of my most remarkable business lessons I learnt is what I call \u201cJungle Rules\u201d. It\u2019s about knowing who to trust in business. I also learnt, from other businesses, not to let shame be the reason why I don\u2019t achieve my goals, or even try.\n\nOne time in 200 Level, I had to quit school to man my popcorn stand because the lady I employed swindled me and opened a competing shop opposite mine. My course mates would take photos and post it on our WhatsApp group to make fun of me. But I didn\u2019t mind because I was already familiar with the concept of no shame in business. I knew they were not going to feed me anyway and I saw it as free advertisement.\n\nSo by the time I started Patricia, I had so much first-hand experience. There was barely any challenge in the first two years that was new to me. It was like Slumdog Millionaire; I had literally gone through the motions. In fact, it\u2019s just now that things are becoming new, because it\u2019s a different ball game managing 300 people around the world.\n\nAnother blessing that is a stumbling block for young entrepreneurs today is the fact that there\u2019s a tech community. So they want to operate within the laws of the tech community. They want to go and raise funds, they want to go and seek somebody\u2019s advice.\n\nI did not do any of that. I didn\u2019t even know there was a tech community for the first two years of running Patricia. That was a blessing for me because it was just idea to execution. I did not know that I could actually get money from somebody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I knew was this business needed a certain amount of money to execute this, and that was our next goal. And somehow we always got it with just sheer tenacity.\n\nMM: Can you give a few practical tips on how you grew the company without raising institutional funding?\n\nHFA: So, like I said earlier, I started the company with \u20a6800,000 (~$2240 in 2017) in personal savings. I rented a boy\u2019s quarters for \u20a6500,000 (~$1400 in 2017), furnished it with about \u20a6100,000 ($280), bought a couple of second-hand laptops and \u20a630,000 ($84) each. I had about \u20a6120,000 ($336) left which I planned to use to pay initial salaries. I called for interviews and hired two people whom I was to pay 30k each.\n\nBut one month into starting the company, we had made zero naira. I was quite frustrated but did not relent. Like I said, raising funds was not even an option I knew existed. So I had to think creatively.\n\nGrowing up, I saw the power of influencers. I remember back in school (University of Port Harcourt) when Olamide dyed his hair brown. In less than one week, half of my school had dyed their hair brown. Now, imagine if Olamide said \u201cuse Patricia\u201d? I was pretty sure some people would because Olamide said so.\n\nI couldn\u2019t afford Olamide of course. But I could afford Mr. Jollof. We had a mutual friend through whom I negotiated with him to make an ad for \u20a680,000 (~$224 in 2017). He made the ad, sent it to me, I hated it. He was just on his seat, relaxed and very casual.\n\nBut then he put out the ad early in the morning of the next day, without informing us. Before you know it, enquiries and transactions started trickling in. By the end of the day, we had completed about 40 to 50 transactions, excluding enquiries. I checked and saw that we had made \u20a6180,000 (~$504 in 2017) in one day. I took all of that money, paid him again and paid somebody else. And that was how things kicked off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should also add that the kind of business we are in is a fast moving business. And we were the only ones doing what we were doing in 2017, in the whole of Africa. At most, there was a Luno but that was only for a very select few. There was really nobody doing what we were doing for the masses. Patricia was many people\u2019s first break into crypto and gift cards. So we always made money. As a matter of fact, we were making way more money that I knew what to do with.\n\nI had also built up a savings culture from reading The Richest Man in Babylon. I put all the money we made over 14/15 months in crypto (bitcoin). One bitcoin was worth $3000 at the time, I still have bitcoin from that time. Today, bitcoin is worth over $40,000. So just imagine how much return we made from an investment we made in 2017/2018.\n\nSo we really did not need to raise funds because we never lacked funds.\n\nMM: If offered VC money now, will you take it?\n\nHFA: To whoever is reading this, we need $50m. I\u2019ve crunched the numbers; for us to become a proper global company, $50m will be a very good start for a Series A.\n\nMM: How did you discover crypto though, at that early stage? You said no one else was really doing it in Africa\n\nHFA: It was our customers that turned us on to crypto. We started out as a gift card exchange platform.\n\nMM: Gift cards? What\u2019s the story here?\n\nHFA: I asked one of my uncles, in London, for money. Instead, he sent me a gift card. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I checked everywhere and found nowhere to convert the gift card to cash. Actually, I found one obscure platform but I got scammed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt hurt me that I lost the money but it also informed me that if I got scammed, somebody somewhere too had the same problem.\n\nMM: So you had this bright idea, what was the next step? Did you have to code up an app or something?\n\nHFA: Nope, I have zero technical background.\n\nI have many principles I live by and one of them is Occam\u2019s Razor. Occam\u2019s Razor basically states that sometimes, and most times (90% of the time in my experience), the best solution is usually the simplest solution. I don\u2019t like to overthink things; the first idea that comes to my head is what I implement first. That way, I\u2019ve saved almost 2 weeks of planning and already have a foundation to build on.\n\nSo, I had the idea in 2015. I wrote it down. In 2017, I executed. Going with my principles, we built Patricia off WhatsApp.\n\nMM: That must have made things very difficult\n\nHFA: Yes, it was so difficult. But it was so much fun. We didn\u2019t even see it as stress.\n\nMM: How did you go about employing your earliest employees?\n\nHFA: After I rented the boy\u2019s quarters, I reached out to my musician brother\u2019s manager who helped me put the word out on Twitter. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting people to show up but they did. Five people showed up and I hired two, Chris and Beauty. Chris, who is technically employee number two and has been with the company since then, is now the COO of Patricia.\n\nMM: What have you learnt about hiring people?\n\nHFA: I have learnt to trust my gut. I think I have a very good gut, far more than anything.\n\nI can tell you many stories about how I met my key executives. I met my current Chief of People, Chika Uluocha, when I went to open an account for Patricia at the bank she worked at. I entered the bank, saw this lady at the front desk and just knew she was the one I needed to speak to. So I waited for her to be free.\n\nWe spoke from 10am till about 6pm, about everything. I was so inspired and impressed that I told her I would employ her someday. She didn\u2019t take me seriously but we kept in touch.\n\nA few months later, we had moved from the boy\u2019s quarters to a duplex. That\u2019s another interesting side story.\n\nWe started in August, 2017. By December, Beauty had already left so it was just me and Chris. But Chris had to travel home for the holidays, leaving me with so much work to handle. This was the defining moment for Patricia. You know how obsessive entrepreneurs are portrayed in movies? That was my obsession phase. I had no Christmas or New Year holiday. I lost track of time, as I worked almost non-stop from the 5th of December until the middle of February, when Chris returned, a month later than he was meant to.\n\nChris discovered that Patricia had made \u20a63.5m (~$9800 in 2017) in profit over that two-month period. I had no idea!\n\nYou know what I did? I took all of that money and rented a 5-bedroom duplex as our new office. Everyone thought I was crazy. But that\u2019s the thing about vision. Nobody can really see things the way you do. Besides, I was certain that we\u2019d make that money back in another one or two months.\n\nWe filled the space up with a couple more people, some of whom are still with us today. That was when Chika came in from the bank. I invited her to come see what we\u2019d done. She was so blown away that she quit her job at the bank and joined us. She actually accepted a pay cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatricia office in 2018 (the 5-bedroom duplex)\n\nMM: A lot has changed since then. Patricia is now officially headquartered in Estonia. Tell us about that decision\n\nHFA: The crypto ban happened but business has to go on; there are mouths to feed and I won\u2019t just lay off my staff because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says that we can\u2019t do business anymore.\n\nSo we decided we needed a crypto license to enable expansion outside the shores of Africa. At the grand scale of things, Nigeria is still a very small pie. Coinbase, the biggest crypto player in the world, worth over $80bn, does not have a footprint in Africa. This means there is more out there than there is in here.\n\nThat was why we moved to Estonia, got a license, and we now have operations in 27 EU countries, with just one move. So the CBN ban was a setback for something greater. We were going to expand at some point but just not this year. The CBN accelerated our expansion.\n\nMM: Advice for budding entrepreneurs? Especially those still in school\n\nHFA: Have a journal where you write your ideas down. If I never wrote Patricia down, I\u2019d never have had something to look back to.\n\nRead a lot of books, not just your school books. Read far and wide, whatever your interests are.\n\nThen try a lot of things. You have all the time to fail. You know, most people don\u2019t even try because they are afraid of failing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried and failed at 13 businesses. But trust me, if I had to try 100 businesses, I would. Because I read that Thomas Edison tried the light bulb a thousand times. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s true but if anyone can try something a thousand times, they must succeed. And if you don\u2019t succeed, you will discover penicillin.\n\nMM: What are the future plans for Patricia over the next 3 to 10 years?\n\nHFA: Our plan is to make crypto easier for the entire world.\n\nThere\u2019s a fifth revolution coming. One common trend about previous revolutions is that they don\u2019t announce themselves. They are usually almost over before we realise, \u201coh that was the nth revolution.\u201d\n\nNow, everything has evolved in this world, except money. But money is evolving now and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much push back.\n\nIf you look at it, every pioneer of the 4th revolution is a billionaire today. Amazon, PayPal, eBay, etc. They were all made in the 1990s, at the start of the fourth revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the fifth revolution is here and it\u2019s the evolution of money. That is where we want to be at. So in the next 5 to 10 years, Patricia will be the Apple, the Amazon, the eBay of the world in cryptocurrency.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian telemedicine startup, iWello, is making healthcare available to people living on less than $1 per day",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Ismail Adejonwo\u2019s mother experienced a troubling stomach ache. The family had no money and was hesitant to take her to the hospital.\n\nBut as the clock kept ticking, the pain became unbearable. At this point, he had no choice but to take his mother to the hospital.\n\nWhen they arrived at the hospital, the doctor informed them that they had brought her late. She was diagnosed with appendicitis, which was treated successfully with a simple surgery.\n\nEntirely unrelated, Dr Fatima Ajayi, Adejonwo\u2019s pregnant family friend, fainted during a ward round in 2019 after working a 12-hour shift. Sadly, her boss dismissed her for the day without further concern about her well-being. Adejonwo decided not to overlook these events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2019, these issues sparked a lot of thought in me. For my mother, we might have known what the problem was sooner if we had consulted a doctor, which could have saved her the weeks of agony she endured. Another reason we were hesitant to take her to the hospital was a lack of funds. This, too, could have been taken care of if there had been surgery funding available instead of the embarrassment of begging,\u201d Adejonwo explains.\n\nThe incident involving his family friend, Ajayi, bothered him too. Because he wanted to address incidents like these two, he began brainstorming solutions to the problems.\n\nLater in 2019, he had an idea that he pitched to a doctor friend, Bolu Balogun, on Twitter.\n\nIn 2020, Adejonwo (CEO), Ajayi (Head, Family Medicine), and Balogun (Head, General Medicine) collaborated on an idea. The idea became iWello, a telemedicine startup, and was launched in July 2021 as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) where users can easily consult with doctors.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsmail Adejonwo, Founder and CEO\n\nBefore founding iWello, despite his zero medical background, Adejonwo had over six years of startup experience.\n\nFor three years, he was the Head of Content and Digital Marketing at a student marketplace, Vasiti.com. He also had a stint as Head of Business Development at Guided Beginning, an educational and parenting startup, for four years\n\nBalogun, on the other hand, is a skilled urologist with a Masters in Clinical Urology, and she has worked in the telemedicine field for reputable companies such as Tremendoc.\n\nAjayi is a family medicine specialist with over five years of experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare for those who live below $1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, iWello claims it provides a sense of belonging to low-income people \u2014 those who live paycheck to paycheck, have difficulty living above $1 per day and live in slums and rural areas.\n\nAnd one of iWello\u2019s priorities is for them to know that there is an available healthcare solution where their health needs can be met.\n\niWello is a telemedicine platform that allows anyone, regardless of income level, to gain access to healthcare for as little as $1 and surgery funding while also ensuring the well-being of doctors and healthcare workers.\n\nThere are two types of surgery funding: paid and free. For the former, the company pays for it before the surgery, and the client repays later. Essentially, iWello pays for the surgery in full, and patients pay in instalments after the surgery is complete.\n\nThe team hopes to cover all types of surgeries, but for the time being, they are focusing on minor surgeries \u2014 like appendix removal, caesarean section for pregnant women, and kidney failure issues \u2014 and major surgeries that are less than \u20a610 million ($24,306.62).\n\niWello exercises measures to ensure that its users have at most three guarantors who agree to be debited automatically if a user defaults. Depending on the schedule chosen, payment could be monthly, weekly, or daily.\n\nThe free option functions similarly to a social trust fund with profits and donations from the general public who pay for people who cannot afford the paid opportunity.\n\n\u201cAll the user has to do is register, and their surgery will be funded. But it will be on a first-come, first-served basis, which means there will be a waiting list, and we will work from that list until the social trust fund is depleted,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nAlso, they provide consultations, medication, and treatment for three of the world\u2019s most lethal diseases: malaria, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we want to make a difference in the high mortality rates for common diseases like malaria, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\n\u201cWe currently serve through our website and are in the process of developing a mobile app.\u201d\n\nFor users and doctors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niWello\u2019s homepage\n\nAlthough iWello is just three months old and competes against startups like Tremendoc and WellaHealth, and indirect competitors like Helium Health, Adejonwo says, \u201cour services outperform most of them in terms of affordability, sharing formulas with doctors, and a pay-as-you-go integrated healthcare system that cares for people from the point of consultation to treatment.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage is that it covers the patient\u2019s entire customer journey, from consultation to treatment, which only a few telemedicine startups do.\n\nSimilarly, iWello considers its doctors\u2019 well-being by paying them a higher percentage \u2014 70% \u2014 of every consultation and treatment they provide. And offers surgery funding, a service Reliance Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO), a telemedicine insurance company, also provides.\n\nA viable model\n\niWello is currently self-funded. It also recently placed second in the Ivery Arie pitch competition and expects to complete an Angel round led by a group of lawyers in October \u2014 this month.\n\n\u201cWe are currently at the pre-revenue stage. We are not yet making profit and are currently offering a freemium service to users,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nHowever, the company makes money primarily through commissions and subscriptions. While a doctor receives 70% of the revenue from each consultation and treatment performed on the platform, iWello gets 30%.\n\n\u201cWe charge no interest for surgeries but a fixed service charge depending on the surgery type. However, we charge \u20a6300 ($0.73) per consultation,\u201d he says.\n\niWello is currently testing its pharmaceutical marketplace with a phoney drug checker where you can buy drugs instantly, speak with a pharmacist, and verify the drugs\u2019 authenticity.\n\n\u201cPharmacists will receive a 5-10% commission on every drug sold on our pharmaceutical marketplace,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nThe pharmaceutical marketplace is still in beta mode and has not yet been launched. The company anticipates that it will be available before the end of this year.\n\nAlthough the company has a user base of 140 clients and 14 doctors, it hopes to reach at least 36,000 people in each local government in Lagos State.\n\niWello plans to cover all 20 local governments in Lagos State before expanding into other Southwestern states, then the East and North, by the end of 2022. It also plans to expand into another African country, Ghana, by 2023.\n\nEnduring challenges through teamwork\n\nOne of the most difficult challenges iWello has faced is raising awareness and staying afloat in the absence of funding.\n\n\u201cOffline, we used tracking cards so that people could scan them and easily contact us, and we also reached out personally based on health issues they shared on platforms like Twitter,\u201d he says.\n\nIn terms of funding, the team has tried applying for grants, entered pitch competitions, and pitched to some angel investors. Now, they seem to be making some headway.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the team is solely committed to this project and is working on it full time. Most of us have been working pro-bono, and even recent members on the team joined based on the impact they believe iWello can have on the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adejonwo, the government is not doing enough to improve the country\u2019s healthcare situation, which is why people continue to die from common diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, and doctors are leaving the country in droves.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I believe that with iWello, we can make a difference in the healthcare industry,\u201d he concludes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied\n\nSome of the biggest businesses we know today started with the founder(s) trying to solve a problem that they faced. Think of startups like Spanx and Canva, and you realise that solving a personal problem can be a huge motivation for starting a business.\n\nThe same rings true for Godwin Benson and Abiola Oyeniyi, Co-founders of edtech startup, Tuteria. After facing difficulties receiving payment for tutoring a student, Benson wondered if there was a way to solve the problem for others like him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe desire to solve that problem stayed with him from 2005 to 2014 when Tuteria was launched.\n\nSo what does Tuteria do? In simple terms, the startup connects students with tutors for a fee. If you have used a tutor, attempted to employ a tutor for a child, or know someone who has, then you know how difficult that can be, and this is the problem Tuteria is trying to solve for students.\n\nWith tutors in all 36 states in Nigeria, the startup also teaches subjects not covered in traditional schools, including makeup, dancing, and photography, and strives to connect students with tutors closest to them.\n\nOur reporter, Victoria Fakiya, had an interesting conversation with the co-founders of Tuteria.

The round was led by Flori Ventures with Emergence Capital, Fedha Capital and other Angels and VCs taking part.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Ruth Iselema, the startup enables users to buy and sell up to six cryptocurrencies through the Bitmama exchange and send and receive money internationally, buy airtime or data, and pay utility bills through Changera.\n\nHaving secured the funding, Iselema reveals that there are no plans to add to their product offerings. Instead, the startup will focus on expanding its team and making inroads to other countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith cryptocurrencies becoming the rave, Nigerians have been early adopters, with more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies traded on local crypto exchanges in 2020.\n\nDespite the Nigerian government banning the trading of cryptocurrencies via banks early this year, the crypto market suffered very little damage.\n\nThis year alone, Bitmama has reportedly facilitated transactions worth more than $6 million and has over 15,000 users on the platform.\n\nYou can read more on this story on our website: Blockchain payments platform, Bitmama raises $350k pre-seed to expand product offerings\n\nYou can also read our feature on Ruth Iselema: Meet Ruth Iselema, The Bitmama of the African blockchain space\n\nChanges at Airtel Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlusegun Ogunsanya, CEO Airtel Africa.

The first is the change in leadership as Olusegun Ogunsanya, former CEO of Airtel Nigeria, assuming the role of Managing Director and CEO of Airtel Africa, replacing Raghu Mandava\n\nBack in May, when his appointment was first announced, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Airtel, said, \u201cWe are delighted to appoint Segun Ogunsanya as the Group\u2019s next Chief Executive Officer. He has displayed significant drive and energy in turning around the Nigeria business by focusing on network modernisation, distribution, and operational efficiency.\u201d\n\nOgunsanya comes into the role with over 20 years of experience across the banking, telecommunications, and consumer goods sectors.\n\nReacting to his new appointment, Ogunsanya said, \u201cI am looking forward to building on the solid foundations the Group has established for future sustainable growth across Africa.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we will invest even more in our network and distribution channels to serve the communities where we operate. By doing this, we will continue to sustainably bridge the digital divide, expand financial inclusion and meet the evolving needs of our customers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Airtel Africa has announced plans to buy back minority shares in its Nigerian subsidiary, Airtel Networks Limited, at \u20a655.81 per share. This was disclosed in a statement by Mr Simon O\u2019Hara, the Group Company Secretary, on Monday, October 4, 2021.\n\nTrouble in Zuckerville\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@dole777?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>dole777</a> on <a href=\u201d/s/photos/social-media?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nOn Monday, October 4, 2021, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp experienced outages across the world.

We\u2019re working to get things back to normal and will send an update here as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nWhile it is not clear what caused the outage, experts believe it could be a DNS error.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a gauge for manufacturing sentiments has shown signs of recovery as it achieved 50.3 points in September according to data by FBN Quest and NOI.\n\nThe index had dropped continuously from 51 points in May to 48 points in July before it picked up in August with 49.6 points. However, concerns are raised as to whether the growth recorded reflects the realities of the struggling sector.\n\nAnalysts at FBN Quest note that one of the impacts of the global headwinds was the cut in supply of imported inputs and materials used for production by manufacturers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe headlines are full of faltering supply chains, which in the case of Nigeria are made worse by challenges surrounding the cost of, and access to FX,\u201d according to the analysts.\n\nThe supply cut caused a shortfall in the availability of raw materials and inputs which drove an increase in production cost to 21 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector records trade deficit of N4.3trn in Q2 2021\n\nHamma Kwajaffa, director-general, Nigerian Textile Employers Association (NTEA) told BusinessDay that the situation is further aggravated by the scarcity and increased price of raw materials due to the extended lockdown of principal partner countries like southern China which has clogged ports critical to global trade.\n\n\u201cThere are fears that this may intensify in future as China plans to retain its pandemic border restrictions for at least one more year due to the emergence of new variants and a schedule of major events and exhibitions,\u201d he added.\n\nDisruption at the global supply chain have propelled manufacturers to look inwards for local sourcing of raw materials and inputs.\n\nYemi Osinbajo, vice President of Nigeria said at a recent MAN summit that manufacturers need to expand their capacity and become more competitive through the use of value addition and regional value chain in the production process.\n\n\u201c The regional value chain can be utilized for creation, design, raw material supply, processing, transportation, storage, marketing and sales,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector recorded 3.49 percent growth in the second quarter of 2021 which was also the highest Q2 figure across six years. However analyst at FBN Quest expected a stronger rebound from the -8.8 percent it achieved in the corresponding period of 2020 when the lockdown was in effect.",

The price had reached a 52-week high of N30.26kobo and a corresponding 52-week low of N12.98.\n\nSince shares were admitted for trade on the NASD Plc, the Nigerian Exchange Group Plc trades with a Symbol \u201cSDNGXGROUP\u201d.\n\nAt the start of demutualisation, NGX Group had just 432 shareholders, a number that has doubled since Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading commenced.\n\nThis listing by way of introduction means that NGX Group is not looking to issue new shares nor seeking to relinquish some of the existing shares of its majority shareholder to raise equity capital in the immediate term, but existing shareholders will now be provided with the opportunity to sell to the public leveraging the platform of the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nIf successful, the listing by the introduction of the said shares of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc will translate to an issued share capital of about N32.62 billion.\n\nFollowing the demutualization of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) earlier this year, a new non-operating holding company known as The Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group) was formed.\n\nNGX Group has three operating subsidiaries, namely: Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX Limited), NGX Regulation Limited (NGX REGCO), and NGX Real Estate Limited (NGX RELCO) which are duly registered at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).\n\nRead also: NGX to host inaugural TechNovation Conference\n\nThe stockbrokers to the listing of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc are: Chapel Hill Denham Securities Limited; and RMB Nigeria Stockbrokers Limited; while the Issuing House(s)/Financial Adviser(s) are: Chapel Hill Denham Advisory Limited; and Rand Merchant Bank Nigeria Limited.\n\nWith the successful completion of demutualisation, the Exchange transitioned from a member-owned company to a company owned by shareholders, bringing to an end the leadership of the National Council.\n\nIn this new era, Abimbola Ogunbanjo took on the office of the Group Chairman of Nigerian Exchange Group, while Abubakar Mahmoud assumed office as the Chairman of Nigerian Exchange, Catherine Echeozo as the Chairman of NGX Regulation Limited, and Erelu Angela Adebayo as Chairman of NGX Real Estate Limited.\n\nAll other members of the dissolved National Council are serving in various capacities on the Boards of the new entities.\n\nAs the NGX Group progresses its plans to list on Nigerian Exchange Limited, it looks forward to welcoming a broader group of investors to share in its journey.\n\nAhead of this listing, the Nigerian Exchange Group had in July 2021 engaged analysts where the Management of the Group and its entities provided key insights into the setup of the new structure, current operations and plans.\n\n\u201cThis shows strong prospects for the new types of investors NGX Group can attract once it lists by introduction on NGX\u201d, Oscar N. Onyema, Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), NGX Group Plc said during the analysts call when he was further engaged on issues around the activities of NGX Group by way of listings and the introduction of Exchange Traded Derivatives (ETDs) to the market.\n\nThough, the Total Operating Income of N6.018billion as against N7.782 billion in 2019 implies a decrease by 22.67 percent.\n\nNigerian Exchange Group reported operating surplus after tax of N1.83billion in 2020, from N2.25 billion in 2019, which represents a decrease of 18.56percent, according to its audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nOnyema said the 2020 results reflect the challenging macroeconomic and market conditions, \u201cas well as operational resilience of the Group with income and resulting surplus after tax valued at N6.02 billion and N1.84 billion respectively.\u201d\n\nThe financial scorecard, which is the NGX group\u2019s first publicly circulated financial after demutualization shows its revenue printed lower by 23.92percent in the review year to N3.76 billion from N4.954 billion in 2019. Operating Surplus before tax at N1.909 billion in 2020 represents 17 percent decrease from N2.3 billion in 2019.\n\nFurther look at the NGX Group results show that share of profit of equity-accounted investees rose to N2.003billion from N1.531billion in 2019, representing an increase of 30.83percent.\n\nAt the 60th Annual General Meeting of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (Formerly Nigerian Stock Exchange) will hold at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on Thursday, September 9, 2021, the shareholders considered and approved among others \u2013 further to Members\u2019 approval at the Extra-Ordinary General Meeting of March 3, 2020, for the establishment of an Employee Share Ownership Plan for the benefit of qualifying employees of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc and its Subsidiaries \u2013that the\n\nCompany issues and allots 200,419,990 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each out of the authorised share capital of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc for the operation of a Long Term Incentive Plan consisting of a Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) and an Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP), with effect from January 1, 2021, subject to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nThe shareholders also approved for the Board of Directors to establish and operate a Deferred Bonus Plan for the benefit of qualifying members of the Senior and Executive Management of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc and its subsidiaries and an Employee Share Purchase Plan open to all employees of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group told shareholders that a total of 100,209,995 units of ordinary shares would be allocated for the deferrals over the cycles in which the allocated shares can cover.\n\nThe NGX Group said the DBP is expected to help the Group better retain key talent and high performers to deliver on strategic imperatives.\n\nA total of 100,209,995 units of ordinary shares would form the pool to be offered under the ESPP for purchase by the employees of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc and its subsidiaries, at a discount of between 15percent \u2013 20percent of the market share price, subject to the fixed cap per employee and availability of the pool.\n\n\u201cStaying firmly afloat during the stormy financial year, the Group recorded an operating surplus of N1.84 billion for the year, which represented a decline of 18.56percent from 2019. Our listing fees income reflected the headwinds dealt by the Covid-19 pandemic, declining by 62.66percent from the previous year driven by uncertainty of prospective issuers in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nFollowing Management\u2019s cost containment efforts, total expenses declined by 12.86percent year-on-year without affecting The Exchange\u2019s high operating standards and service delivery.\n\nConversely, our net assets grew by 10.03percent to N31.28 billion providing us with greater financial flexibility to execute on our strategic agenda and respond to changes in our operating environment\u201d, said Abimbola Ogunbanjo, NGX Group Chairman.",

Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu; Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare; former Governor of Edo State, Chief Lucky Igbinedion; wife of Osun State Governor and Chairman Southern Governor\u2019s Wives Forum, Mrs. Kafayat Oyetola and wife of Bayelsa State Governor, Mrs. Gloria Diri, amongst others.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Obaseki, \u201cWhat we have seen and experienced in the last one week of this tournament is the highest form of professionalism in Nigerian football.\n\n\u201cWe had three major goals in mind when we crafted this tournament. One of the goals was to recapture our God-given position as the foremost sporting state in Nigeria and the custodian and pacesetter of all team sports in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also to create a platform and an opportunity for young girls all over Nigeria and Edo State in particular. It will enable them to build a career in football and develop their capacity so that they can become professional footballers.\n\n\u201cThe third objective is to create a world-class women\u2019s football tournament as a way of providing avenues to qualifying women teams across Nigeria; it will help to prepare them for the main season\u2019s games. This game is a pre-season tournament to provide our girls the opportunities to grow their talents better and acquire new skills and techniques. This is expected to ensure professionalism, enabling them to succeed year after year,\u201d she added.\n\nThe first lady commended the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki; his deputy, Shaibu and other members of the state\u2019s executive council for their support towards the success of the tournament. She also thanked the 12 participating teams.\n\nShe noted: \u201cWe have plans for Edo Queens to make each of the girls adopt a female school in the state and organize a pre-season game or competition to mentor the girls at their adopted schools, exposing them to football. This will help us discover new talents in order to get to the destination of becoming the number one state in all sports in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith this tournament, we will continuously push for the wellbeing of the girl-child and it will be our prime target, putting all the issues affecting them on the front burner. What we are seeking with this tournament is to advocate against human trafficking and drug abuse amongst the youths, as well as push for education for the girl-child.\u201d\n\n...",

We had the COVID-19 pandemic that bedevilled the whole world, kidnapping of students and other things. When we finished the assessment on the reopening of boarding schools, we decided to skip third term for the whole secondary schools, (boarding and day), in the state.\n\n\u201cWe did that because we took into consideration that examination bodies like WAEC, NECO, NABTEB and even NBAIS would not wait for our students when the examinations are due. So, we decided to skip third term to ensure that out students also participate in the examinations.\u201d\n\nMr Charanci said this was not the first time a whole term was being skipped.\n\nHe said in emergency situations, governments at all levels are forced to make adjustments.\n\n\u201cOver 10 states in northern Nigeria are in the first term, so how do you want us to reconcile this? You want us to sacrifice all the students waiting to write their graduating examinations or what?\u201d\n\nWhen asked the measures the government was taking to ensure the lessons missed in the third term are covered, Mr Charanci said provisions have been made.\n\n\u201cWe are specialised teachers. We have done this before and the results were good. We will use all the available options to ensure that the lessons are covered. We have prep, lessons, specialised lessons during break and team teaching. We will ensure that everything is duly covered,\u201d Mr Charanci said.",

          "text": "The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) Monday hit the southern governors on zoning of the presidency, insisting the contest should be thrown open in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, led by Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, had declared that the next president should come from zoning in the spirit of fairness and equity.\n\nThe position was however countered by their northern counterparts and the Northern Elders Forum.\n\nAnd addressing journalists after its meeting in Abuja, CNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said democracy is a game of numbers and the North would therefore not be intimidated.\n\n\u201cSince democracy everywhere is a game of numbers, under no circumstance will the North succumb to intimidation, blackmail or threat from any quarter to abandon its collective franchise by not seeking the presidency in 2023 or any time in the future,\u201d the CNG said.\n\nThe group further said: \u201cDriven by deep patriotism, and commitment to the continuation of democratic politics, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) is extremely disappointed and profoundly agitated by the recent threats by the Southern Governors and elite to intimidate the North out of the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe find the renewed desperation by the South to threaten Northern people\u2019s right to franchise a deliberate attempt to bastardise democracy, cause greater instability in the guise of a contentious, undemocratic power shift arrangement and therefore downright unacceptable.\n\n\u201cAs evidence of an agenda to impose a nonexistent zoning arrangement on the North that has its root and pattern in our history, recall that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which initiated the idea of zoning, had itself literally bungled it at all subsequent elections since 1999.\n\n\u201cOne may recall that in the 1999 elections, when the presidential slot was presumably zoned to the South West, during the PDP\u2019s convention in Jos, Abubakar Rimi from the North and Alex Ekwueme from the South East also aspired alongside Olusegun Obasanjo in the same party, which proved the absence of any enforceable agreement.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Southern politicians like Rochas Okorocha contested in the same PDP against Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2007, when the slot was meant for the North, as testimony that the claimed zoning arrangement was dead even before birth.\n\n\u201cAgain, Goodluck Jonathan, a Southerner, who was supposed to hold the two-year brief following Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death and allow the North to complete its remaining four year-tenure, clung unto power from 2011 to 2014 and even refused to give way in 2015 all in the same PDP.\n\n\u201cThe PDP as well jeopardized the purported zoning arrangement when for instance, a presidential candidate of the party emerged from the same region as the national chairman of the party. Colonel Amadu Ali, a northerner from Kogi State, was national chairman between 2005 and 2008 when Yar\u2019Adua, another Northerner, was allowed to aspire and secure the PDP presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cAnd Dr. Okwesileze Nwodo from southern Nigeria was national chairman in 2010 at the same time Jonathan, a fellow Southerner, clinched the PDP\u2019s presidential ticket for the 2011 election.\n\n\u201cWorse, the consciousness appears to be eroding the southern politicians and elite that for the entire 16 years of PDP leadership, the North enjoyed only a two-year presidency and for the 22 years of the return to democracy in 1999 the North is holding power for the 7th year presently.\u201d\n\nCNG\u2019s stand\n\nThe CNG spokesman said the group would not sit and watch the nation disintegrate as a result of controversies surrounding zoning, especially as it affects the North.\n\nHe said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of these concerns and observations, the CNG does not wish to remain silent or passive and allow things that affect the North and potentially cause greater democratic instability in the country to continue unchecked.\n\n\u201cIn the unfolding political chess game, therefore, it is essential that the North anticipates and checkmates the manoeuvres of the South in all possible and likely scenarios, and obtain ascendency over the voices of threat, intimidation and blackmail sounding from the South.\n\n\u201cWe thus make the following stand of ours known: That since democracy everywhere is a game of numbers, under no circumstance will the North succumb to intimidation, blackmail or threat from any quarter to abandon its collective franchise by not seeking the presidency in 2023 or any time in the future.\n\n\u201cThat the northern population, which is in clear majority, will never accept any presidential candidate who is the product of an undemocratic zoning process from whichever party.\n\n\u201cCall the attention of the northern public to get prepared and sensitized to hold any political party, by whatever name it is called that attempts to deny northerners the right to contest the presidency as enemy of the North.\n\n\u201cTo warn any political party that takes any step to block the window for the possible emergence of a northern presidential candidate shall be roundly rejected by the North.\n\n\u201cTo specifically point out that no conspiracy in whatever form will stop the North from fielding a Northerner for the presidency in the PDP in 2023 irrespective of its recent body language that tends to block a northern candidacy by quickly zoning the national chairmanship position to the North which is unacceptable. The North shall definitely seek the presidential even if it holds the national chairmanship.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our call on Northern voters to mobilize against sole concentration on party candidates and vote any credible, transparent, capable, and competent leaders.\n\n\u201cThe CNG has resolved to expose the faces of identified unpatriotic northern traitors who have been paid huge sums of money to market southern candidates.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, CNG said that it will side with the position taken by Northern Elders Forum and the Northern Governors Forum in kicking against zoning of the presidency to any region.\n\n\u201cThe CNG, after due consultation with prominent stakeholders, leaders and elders, has categorically resolved to firmly and solidly align completely with the position taken by the Northern Elders Forum as expressed by Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed and that of the Northern Governors Forum, that zoning of elective positions is unconstitutional, undemocratic and must be jettisoned.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt therefore, the CNG hereby declares that the North, a major stakeholder in whatever happens in and to Nigeria, shall not be obliged to respect any zoning arrangement of any elective position in whatever party.\n\n\u201cAs we categorically reject anything to do with any undemocratic process such as zoning, we urge all northerners to resist the antics and tactics of the self-appointed antagonists and hired cronies from the North who are today all over the place conscripted in the conspiracy to deceive northerners into abandoning what God has blessed us with; its human resources,\u201d Suleiman said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will ensure that the permit of any Igbo man obeying the sit-at-home order by IPOB in the North is revoked. The Igbo in the North are not harassed, intimidated or prevented from doing their businesses in the North, so they have no reason to obey IPOB. Complying means that they\u2019re supporting IPOB.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of emphasis, NEF, NGF and others are saying there should be nothing like zoning. Any obscure group that is allegedly championing the northern interest and advocating for zoning should be disregarded. Also, the presidency should not necessarily be zoned to the North. It should be open for all competent Nigerians to aspire, though we are blessed with human resources, especially voting power in the North.\u201d",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

It is a blessing to be alive as many people have returned to their Creator. The situation in the Country is suggesting that women are failing in their responsibilities because the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was reported to have said that if women are good the society will be good and it will be devoid of evils.\n\n\u201d Unfortunately, women have abandoned their celestial and domestic duties. We now run after worldly things . We now compete with the men folk at the expense of our homes. Mothers are no longer available to train their children. The result is a society that is full of evil and evil doers. Social vices are widespread among the youth, the elderly and even the leaders. Most of these agents of destruction and criminals have mothers. We need to do more to rid our society of evils \u201d The National Amirah said\n\nHajia Sanni urged Nigerian women to retrace their steps , pay attention to their homes and speak with one voice by condemning the evil in the society and serving as the best examples for their children, wards and families at large.\n\nShe also stressed the need for men to give maximum support to their wives in terms of encouragement, finances and in every means possible to enable them achieve their set goals, adding that women will perform their divine duties excellently well and function effectively in the society if men perform their duties as the overall heads of every household.\n\n\u201d Let\u2019s always pray for the people in government. As women, we should be agents of positive changes. At FOMWAN, our target as faith based Association has always been to advance the course of women and children, train them to be useful citizens, assist them in discharging their duties as divinely instructed and above all make them partners in progress for all round societal development.\u201d She stressed\n\nHajia Sanni who is the tenth National Amirah of the Association further said despite the various problems facing Nigeria since independence sixty-one years ago, Allah is still keeping the country together as one.\n\nThis, according to her shows that the country will achieve greater heights if everyone plays his or her part and work together.\n\n\u201d We should avoid divisive tendencies and practices capable of throwing us into any form of war. Our leaders should see the need for more dialogue on how to move Nigeria forward. As the Giant of Africa , the sky is our starting point if we do things rightly \u201c",

Peaches is made exclusively with the cannabis brand Palms Premium. Adults and medical cannabis patients across the country can purchase Bieber\u2019s weed beginning on October 4, 2021. It will be sold in four states: California, Nevada, Massachusetts, and Florida.\n\nBieber is a Grammy-award winning artist with a voracious, international fan base that includes 198 million followers on Instagram alone. Bieber\u2019s viral mention of cannabis in the song \u201cPeaches\u201d off of his latest album Justice is the namesake inspiration for this preroll pack.\n\nIn California, you can find Peaches on shelves at select dispensaries including Haven and MedMen, as well as through delivery partnerships with Eaze and Amuse. In Nevada, expect to see the Peaches line grown by Flower One and sold at MedMen and Planet13. In Massachusetts, Peaches will be sold at NETA Dispensaries and in Florida, it will be found at Surterra Wellness retail stores through a partnership with cannabis cultivators at Parallel in both states.\n\n\u201cOur goal with Palms is simply to open the conversation and destigmatize recreational cannabis,\u201d says Tyler Breton, co-founder of Palms. Breton says the Palms brand is for \u201cnot only experienced users, who will appreciate the quality and attention to detail, but first time and casual consumers exhibiting the approachability and benefits of our products.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2018 with headquarters in Hollywood, Palms is an elevated preroll brand that can be found on shelves throughout Nevada and California. Palms and Bieber came together through a mutual connection in the industry: Ceres, Scooter Braun\u2019s cannabis fund. Braun is Bieber\u2019s longtime manager. Ceres is a SPAC that invests in international brands with a focus on cannabis wellness, CBD, and health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited about it,\u201d says Noah Annes, co-founder of Palms. \u201cThe whole goal of Palms is to destigmatize cannabis consumption. To be approachable, to be elevated, for people who are less familiar or comfortable with cannabis. To work with Justin is really consistent with our mission.\u201d\n\nBieber has used his celebrity status to be candid about his mental health journey. The musician offered an intimate portrait of his struggles with mental health on his YouTube Original docuseries Seasons.\n\n\u201cJustin [Bieber]\u2019s vulnerability and openness about his mental health struggles impressed us beyond measure, and we knew immediately we would want him to be at the helm of our first-ever collaboration,\u201d says Annes. \u201cWith Justin\u2019s help shining the spotlight on these important topics, we hope to inspire others to talk more freely about both mental health and cannabis consumption.\u201d",

          "text": "Facebook Inc blamed a \u201cfaulty configuration change\u201d for a nearly six-hour outage on Monday that prevented the company\u2019s 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.\n\nThe company in a late Monday blog post did not specify who executed the configuration change and whether it was planned.\n\nSeveral Facebook employees who declined to be named had told Reuters earlier that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems.\n\nThe failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error, the employees said. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider were both plausible.\n\n\u201cWe want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change,\u201d Facebook said in the blog.\n\nThe Facebook outage is the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector.\n\nThe outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.\n\nAs the world flocked to competing apps such as Twitter and TikTok, shares of Facebook fell 4.9%, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. Shares rose about half a percent in after-hours trade following resumption of service.\n\n\u201cTo every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer tweeted, adding that it \u201cmay take some time to get to 100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook basically locked its keys in its car,\u201d tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\n\nTwitter on Monday reported higher-than-normal usage, which led to some issues in people accessing posts and direct messages.\n\nIn one of the day\u2019s most popular tweets, video streaming company Netflix shared a meme from its new hit show \u201cSquid Game\u201d captioned \u201cWhen Instagram & Facebook are down,\u201d that showed a person labeled \u201cTwitter\u201d holding up a character on the verge of falling labeled \u201ceveryone.\u201d\n\nInside a Facebook group for ad buyers, one member wisecracked after service returned that \u201clots of people searched today \u2018how to run google ads for clients.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook, which is the world\u2019s largest seller of online ads after Google, was losing about $545,000 in U.S. ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to estimates from ad measurement firm Standard Media Index.\n\nPast downtime at internet companies has had little long-term affect on their revenue growth, however.\n\nFacebook\u2019s services, including consumer apps such as Instagram, workplace tools it sells to businesses and internal programs, went dark noon Eastern time (1600 GMT). Access started to return around 5:45 pm ET.\n\nSoon after the outage started, Facebook acknowledged users were having trouble accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem or say how many users were affected.\n\nThe error message on Facebook\u2019s webpage suggested an error in the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations. A similar outage at cloud company Akamai Technologies Inc took down multiple websites in July.\n\nOn Sunday, Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, revealed that she was the whistleblower who provided documents underpinning a recent Wall Street Journal investigation and a U.S. Senate hearing last week on Instagram\u2019s harm to teen girls.\n\nHaugen was due to urge the same Senate subcommittee on Tuesday to regulate the company, which she plans to liken to tobacco companies that for decades denied that smoking damaged health, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters.",

It is also the same situation in the upscale Asokoro, where almost all the streets are littered with refuse dumps.\n\nInterestingly it is in Asokoro that almost all the state governments have their multi-billion naira lodges.\n\nDeputy Director of Information, AEPB, Janet Peni, has not been forthcoming on the issue.\n\nAEPB is statutorily in charge of waste management in Asokoro, Maitama and other places that fall within the jurisdiction of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\nThe situation was even more worrisome in satellite towns, like Lugbe, Karu, Kubwa, Deidei, Mpape Gwagwalada and Nyanya where traders indiscriminately display their ware, including vegetable and fruits close to open dumps and in some cases right on those dumps.\n\nIt might however shock residents to realise that Director AEPB, Abubakar Alhassan, who has the mandate of ensuring cleanliness of the city has been rather preoccupied with shifting official files around, as he has just three weeks before his statutory retirement from the civil service.\n\nOne of the waste management contractors, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that evacuation of refuse has been tardy following delays in payment.\n\nHe bemoaned that most of the contractors were frustrated and stressed, as they now resort to borrowing to pay workers on an installment basis.\n\nThis, he noted has led to some categories of workers, who were not comfortable with the delayed mode of payment, to refuse to come to work.\n\n\u201cIt is only few street sweepers, who accept a token from their wages, that are still coming to work, while the truck drivers who evacuate dumps from streets had downed tools to protest delays in their payment schedule,\u201d the contractor said.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
