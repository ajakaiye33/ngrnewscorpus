          "text": "The National Executive Council of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has outlined a number of conditions which the Federal Government must meet before it can fully deregulate the downstream oil sector.\n\nPresiding over the meeting in Abuja on Saturday, TUC President, Quadri Olaleye, said government has no basis for proposing to finally hands off subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) when it has not taken into consideration palliatives to over 40 million extremely poor Nigerians.\n\nThe TUC equally noted that there must be assurances that refineries are fully overhauled and establishment of modular refineries encouraged.\n\nThey also noted the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, lamenting that while it has resulted in several job losses, there should be concrete policy initiatives by government to generate mass employment.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that an existing adhoc committee set up by the National Economic Council (NEC) with Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El Rufai as chairman, had met severally, where they drafted a report proposing total liberalisation of the downstream oil sector, a development that may shore up the price of PMS from the current N165 to N302 per litre.\n\nWhile they met at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, last week Thursday, to harmonise their position, Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, had disclosed that the committee had not yet decided on the subsidy removal, as a time line of June 2022 still exits before it can be reconsidered.\n\nBut among other conditions, the TUC expects government at the state and federal levels to meet, including putting measures in place to ameliorate the suffering of the people through food security and infrastructural development.\n\nAccording to the union, the proposal by the National Economic Council on the final removal of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) as from June 2022 should take into consideration the attendant economic impact on the economy.\n\nWhile acknowledging the giant stride in rice production through various interventions of the Buhari administration, TUC said the Federal Government should ensure that price of rice in the market becomes affordable to the common man in order to justify the rice revolution policy of the administration.\n\nIt also said it expects that privatisation of the power sector should be reviewed since the contracts have expired to ensure viability, job security and effectiveness of the sector.\n\nOlaleye said failure to meet these demands, TUC state executives would mobilise for industrial action against the government.\n\n\u201cNEC-in-Session insist that Federal Government MUST ensure that the conditions precedent put forward by the TUC on the deregulation of the downstream such as; the revitalization of existing refineries, establishment of new ones including modular refineries, effective policing of boarders to stem the rate of petroleum products smuggling, e t c are implemented.\n\n\u201cNEC-in-Session enjoined Congress members nation-wide to obtain their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) and ensure active participation in the democratic process ahead of 2023 general elections. Members are also urged to support the Political Commission of the Congress in creating groundswell awareness for providing leadership alternatives that deliver on democratic dividends and transformative governance to the people.\n\n\u201cFinally, NEC-in-Session has mandated the Congress led by the President to take all necessary steps to ensure that these conditions are met before SUBSIDY is removed. Consequently, NEC-in-Session directs State Councils and affiliates to commence mobilisation of members for industrial actions against subsidy removal without government fulfilling conditions precedent,\u201d the TUC President stated at a press conference.",

          "title": "2023: IBB wise after the fact",
          "text": "There is no consensus, even among those who think highly of him, that ex-head of state Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida was a great leader. He was affable when he chose to, mild-mannered in a deceptive and corrosive way, proud of his network of acolytes around the country, and loved policy experimentation. But beyond these, his military regime was swirled in controversies and expired in an even bigger electoral controversy. In 2011, around the age of 70, he attempted to return to office as an elected president but was roundly rebuffed. However, at 80, he has begun to pontificate on who the next Nigerian president should be in 2023 and what should qualify such a leader. It is hard to explain what gave him the confidence to speak on a subject in which he neither displayed rigour as military head of state nor stood out among the pantheon of great world leaders. But IBB, as he is more widely known, has never been incommoded by his own failings.\n\nSpeaking to Arise TV last August, he arbitrarily suggests, among other qualifications, that the next president in 2023 should be in his 60s. Why not 40s, 50s, or even 70s? He does not explain, beyond adding a few more qualifications to the effect that no student of leadership would accord any significance. IBB is of course casuistic. No one can predict him or tell where his arguments are heading, or what self-serving purposes he intends them. Hear him: \u201cIf you get a good leader that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay. I have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to, and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with. That is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one or two or three of such persons already in his 60s. I believe so, if we can get him.\u201d\n\nAnd in another interview with Daily Trust TV last week, he further explicates his view on the next president. Says he: \u201cAny person who fits these criteria, then he is the right person as long as he is a Nigerian, a politician, not old like I am, is very conversant with the country, he communicates, he is a very good communicator. He should be able to communicate because a president should be able to walk into a group of people and talk to them on issues concerning Nigeria; not all the time but most of the time. He must have somebody he knows in every part of the country. It is not a tall order. You could limit it to states, you could limit it to local governments, even to the wards if you can, but somebody such that once you hear the name, it is somebody you will say, yes, I have heard that name before either in the country or in his profession; if he is a doctor, a journalist or whatever, all areas, we have heard the name before; okay then I will make an effort to know more about him.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to resist the temptation of thinking he was visualising himself when he was in power. At least he was a fair communicator, and had a network of friends around the country, among other qualities he has been very proud of. That he is, however, simply scratching the veneer of leadership, great leadership, that is, does not occur to him at all. Quite clearly, whether in power or out of power, IBB has spent little time reading up on leadership beyond Niccolo Machiavelli\u2019s 16th century book, The Prince, and Sun Tzu\u2019s 5th century BC Chinese classic, The Art of War. Contemporary books on leaders and leadership have escaped him. So, he is unable to appreciate the place of intelligence, intuition, judgement and character in forging great leadership. Having spent his years in power subverting the country and the principles and values that have shaped it, and creating antagonisms between the country\u2019s elites as well as weakening them by his generosity, it is not surprising that what was uppermost in his mind was surviving in office rather than envisioning a great future for the country.\n\nNow, IBB has the audacity to advise the country on leadership. And he talks about age and about being a great communicator. Really? Worse, rather than the deep mortification that should accompany his deliberate destruction of the Third Republic, which he spent huge amount of Nigerian money to erect, Nigerians hear nothing but justifications from him: annulment of the elections because a coup was in the offing, and retention of the crassly ambitious Gen Sani Abacha in office to \u2018help\u2019 undergird the Ernest Shonekan interim government contraption. Of Gen Abacha\u2019s regime that sacked the Shonekan contraption, here is what IBB said in the Trust interview: \u201cAbacha\u2019s government was very smart. They knew who were the most vociferous discussants about the election, about the coup, about June 12 and so on. They started talking to them and sold a dummy to them and encouraged them to get rid of the interim government: \u2018when we get rid of the interim government, we will bring you back to come and take over your democracy so that a civilian government would be installed\u2019. They sold that dummy to the public and to some prominent persons within the society, and when Abacha stepped in, there were drumming and sighs; \u2018Good thing! Next thing is going to be a democratically-elected government\u2019. I knew, we knew, that it wouldn\u2019t be because the argument was: \u2018Why should I risk my life only to come and hand over power to you?\u2019 That was what happened.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nVery smart, or very devious? And could he realistically absolve himself of responsibility for that destructive and murderous Abacha regime? Alas, he tried. More, he even blamed the country\u2019s elite and civil society for being na\u00efve. It is such a man that is now advising the country on their next president in 2023. The country would listen to him at their peril. He is 80; he really should be silent, considering that his views had neither changed over the years due to remorse nor improved in quality due to new knowledge. It is puzzling that anyone lends him an ear.\n\nGov Matawalle and endless banditry\n\nAfter prognosticating the future trajectory of banditry, suggesting alarmingly that it would not end anytime soon, Zamfara\u2019s governor Bello Matawalle went on to identify the chief reason for his doomsday prophecy. According to him, some notable politicians are playing politics with banditry to embarrass both the federal and state governments. He puts it balefully: \u201cSo you see with the kind of people we have in Zamfara State, I don\u2019t think this issue of banditry will end very soon because, already, some people are behind it. Some people are using it. And all they need is at least to show Nigerians that both the federal and Zamfara state governments are not serious on the issue of insecurity, despite the fact that some of them are involved in the crisis of this insecurity. But we\u2019re doing our best.\u201d\n\nThis is scapegoatism at its worst. Perhaps tired of being accused of not doing enough to ameliorate the socio-economic conditions of the state, where poverty is endemic and school enrolment is dismal, the governor has veered into Nigerian politics\u2019 familiar hunting ground \u2013 blaming others for woes engendered by years of governmental ineptitude. Religion, it appears, is no longer sufficient to blindfold poor and hungry people, and so violence, which banditry connotes, seemed the logical outcome for years of deprivation. Mr Matawalle was of course not the cause of the crisis, but he has had enough time to affect the problem. Scapegoatism is whining: it is not a panacea.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nNationals of Mali in Nigeria gathered in Abuja to protest what they termed \u2018unfair\u2019 and \u2018illegal\u2019 sanctions imposed on Mali by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nThe Malians who trooped to the Embassy of Mali located on IBB Way, Maitama, Abuja, were men, women, youths and children.\n\nThey barricaded the entrance to the Embassy, carrying banners that bear inscriptions such as \u2018The Malian Community in Nigeria Support the Transition Government in Mali,\u2019 and \u2018We are Against ECOWAS Sanctions to the People of Mali.\u2019\n\nECOWAS had during its extraordinary summit in Ghana to deliberate on the political situation in Mali, dismissed plans by the Malian military junta to extend the transition period to five years.\n\nIn its resolution, the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government imposed additional sanctions on Mali which included air and land border closures, recall of member states ambassadors, a trade embargo, cut off financial aid and freezing of Mali\u2019s assets at the Central Bank of West African States.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nECOWAS further announced the suspension of all commercial and financial transactions between ECOWAS member states and Mali, with the exception of essential consumer goods; pharmaceutical products; medical supplies and equipment, including materials for the control of COVID-19 products, and electricity.\n\nSpeaking after receiving a protest letter from the Malian nationals, the Malian Ambassador to Nigeria, Moustapha Traore, said many of the Malian community were coming to the Embassy probably for the first time because of what happened a few days ago in Accra was worrisome to them.\n\nThe Malian Ambassador also said the Malian Community felt the need to come to the Embassy and say no to the sanctions that ECOWAS has imposed on Mali.\n\n\u201cAnd they have written a message that was read right here. And I don\u2019t know if you understand French or not, but if I have just to summarise, they said that the ECOWAS sanctions on Mali are illegal and not fair.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure and Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nAn unease calm is currently sweeping across parts of the South West over fresh cases of attacks by suspected herdsmen in the area. Eight villages in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State recently fell victims. There was also the violent exchange between herdsmen and some Ohori farmers at Idofa village, which left five persons dead, and property worth millions of naira destroyed.\n\nIn Ondo State, some herdsmen attacked farmers in some communities located in two local government areas of the state and Akoko division leading to death of five people. The attack prompted some women in Auga-Akoko and some other neighbouring towns and villages to protest half-naked against the killings and rape and other dangerous attacks being perpetrated by herdsmen against the indigenes. They then appealed to operatives of Amotekun corps and local hunters to come to their aid, as they can no longer sleep with their eyes closed or go to farm.\n\nIn recent times, there had been reported cases of kidnapping in the Ogun State axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The three flashpoints on the road are: Ogunmakin, Onigaari and Ishara. Some cases of kidnapping resulted in payment of ransom running into millions of naira while some led to the death of the victims.\n\nThree victims were kidnapped on the highway on Sunday, January, 16, by gunmen. The Amotekun Commander in Ogun State, Mr. Dave Akinremi, a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police, told Saturday Sun that the agency\u2019s security outfits in Ogun and Oyo States have been collaborating to improve the security on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in conjunction with other security agencies.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe revealed: \u201cWe have meetings of Council of Amotekun Commanders, where we fashion out strategies that we have been employing in checkmating criminal activities. We have been having joint patrols and operations when the need arises. We do share intelligence.\u201d On the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway incident, he acknowledged two cases of kidnapping in recent times but added that they are working out a new approach to security joint operations around the axis.\n\nBut the Secretary-General of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide, while describing as \u201cdisturbing, embarrassing and frustrating\u201d the resurgence of kidnapping on the expressway, called on the governors of Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States to \u201csit together and get the security agencies to monitor the road, supervise it, and be on patrol 24 hours of the day on the highway.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the commissioners of police in both Oyo and Ogun States have visited the flashpoints to beef up security on the entire stretch of the ever-busy road. They assured road users not to entertain any fear whenever they are traveling through the axis. When contacted, the Amotekun Commander in Oyo State, Col Olayinka Olayanju (retd), said that the Nigeria Police Force is the lead security agency in internal security and has been coordinating other security agencies to ensure security of lives and property on the rod.\n\nOgun State government says it will not allow any part of the state to be taken over by terrorists, killer herdsmen, kidnappers or bandits as a safe haven to unleash mayhem on the people. It added that it is already collaborating with neighbouring states like Oyo and Lagos to comb its forests so as to smoke out the \u201charbingers of destruction.\u201d Akinremi who stated this while speaking to newsmen yesterday in Abeokuta, noted that Amotekun personnel in Ogun and Oyo states are now combing the forests to dislodge the terrorists while disclosing that the state government has concluded arrangements to fortify all the 20 local government areas of the state with Amotekun operatives.",

          "text": "* Akume: Chairmanship already assigned to North-central, commends Caretaker Committee\n\n*Sheriff: Rumoured zoning aimed at stopping me from leading APC\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAhead of its National Convention in February 26, there is confusion in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of its chairmanship, with some of the aspirants insisting that it had be decided, and that the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) should just announce it. Others are saying no decision had been reached and want zoning jettisoned.\n\nOn the flip side, except the unforeseen happens, the Chairman of the CECPC, who is also governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is scheming to be on the chairmanship ballot paper when the party converges on Abuja February 26, to elect new National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC had consistently resisted pressure to hold the elective National Convention, with a plan to sit tight and conduct the party\u2019s primaries for the 2023 elections, but recent push from President Muhammadu Buhari forced it to bend backwards, resulting in the announced convention date.\n\nAspirants from outside the North-central, where the National Chairman\u2019s position is rumoured to have been zoned, are anxious for a quick official position from CECPC on the issue, to know whether to halt the time and resources being expended on their campaigns or not.\n\nAlso, by yesterday, some chairmanship aspirants from the North-central were insisting that the party\u2019s stakeholders had all agreed that the position of Chairman be zoned to the region and that the CECPC should just do the needful by making a formal announcement.\n\nOne of the chairmanship aspirants from the zone and the Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, yesterday insisted that the party had zoned the chairmanship to North-central and commended the party\u2019s leadership for doing so.\n\nAkume, who spoke in Abuja through Simone Shango, the Chairman, Contact Committee of his Campaign Organisation, said it was normal for the party to \u201cdeny the zoning arrangement at this point, but a formal announcement would be made soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former Governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, who is also a chairmanship aspirant, described the claim that the position had been zoned to North-central as fake news, adding that other aspirants are afraid of going into the convention with him.\n\nSheriff insisted that he was the target of the rumoured zoning of the position to the North-central, saying he remained the candidate to beat.\n\nHe is of the view that anyone can be chairman \u201cbut not everybody has the capacity to be the chairman.\u201d\n\nAnother chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said while it still remained \u201ca rumour\u201d that the APC chairmanship had been zoned to North-central, it was still in line with his expectation.\n\nMustapha who spoke through his media aide, Dapo Okunbanjo said he remained the frontrunner for the number one party position.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for this zoning, we\u2019ve heard this but we still consider it a rumour just like what the CECPC said. And if indeed it\u2019s zoned officially to North-central, it will be in line with our expectations. We still see ourselves as frontrunners in the race whether it\u2019s zoned or not, but what we are doing is to take things one step at a time.\u201d\n\nThe source that leaked Buni\u2019s move to THISDAY last night, added that the need to perfect the Yobe State governor\u2019s game-plan influenced the delay in announcing the zoning for the office of National Chairman and other party positions.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBuni wants to remain National Chairman; forcing him to organise a National Convention was just a temporary setback. The plan is to declare the National chairmanship position open to the entire North, so that he can contest. Buni has 14 APC governors with him in this plot. His main ally, Abubakar Malami, the Minister of Justice had already cleared the way for him by openly declaring a few weeks back that he could legally combine the office of governor with that of the party\u2019s chairmanship.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY learnt further that Buni, Malami and the 14 governors working with him in the plot would soon meet President Buhari, to convince him on the need for the Yobe governor to continue as chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cOnce they get Buhari\u2019s support, the deal is done. All the other chairmanship candidates will have to step down. Even if they don\u2019t step down, Buni\u2019s name will be the only chairmanship candidate one on the official list of contenders to be voted for on D-Day. This is the list that will be forced on delegates. This guy wants to conduct the 2023 APC primaries and it will be tough stopping this ambition,\u201d added the source.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "At World Economic Forum, Osinbajo Warns Multilateral Finance Institutions against Defunding Oil, Gas Projects in Africa",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday warned multilateral finance institutions against defunding oil and gas projects in Africa, as the Western World continues its drive to phase out polluting fuels, saying such a step would have medium and long term consequences on African economies.\n\nOsinbajo, who delivered a special address (virtually) at the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, added that drastic actions would ultimately impede the aim of phasing out fouling oils.\n\nHe declared: \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation, which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair. We are emphatic in our view that natural gas, which Africa has in abundance, must be accepted as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we in Africa are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, we are also conscious that our energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also urged the international community to meet its pledge that was recently re-affirmed at COP-26, of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\n\nHe likewise called for a waiver on the intellectual property rights, to allow African countries produce COVID-19 vaccines to contain the spread of the virus and improve protection for Nigerians and Africans.\n\nThe vice president lamented that less than 10 per cent of African countries had vaccinated 40 per cent of their population.\n\nHe also warned that there would be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa due to resource constraints, adding, \u201cYet, vaccinations remain essential because of the mutation of the virus and the emergence of variants that may be more dangerous than the Omicron.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo continued: \u201cThere are also the issues around African countries being able to produce their own vaccines. And that is entirely possible with cooperation, especially around intellectual property issues. We have to look at issues around patent rights, intellectual property rights, and exclusivity rights; especially if we\u2019re going to improve the chances of African countries to manufacture vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at relaxing those rights. Patent waivers and intellectual property waivers will be important. These are proved to be a problem now. No one seems to be making much progress in that respect. But we can\u2019t really talk about African countries producing their own vaccines if we don\u2019t address those important structural problems. I think that could very easily be done.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo stressed that despite giant strides recorded across Africa, \u201cthere are still challenges to overcome which requires international collaboration that can help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease and improve governance.\u201d\n\nHe listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7% last year and a projected 3.8% growth in 2022.\n\nThe vice president noted: \u201cThere is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing and digital technology.\u201d\n\nHe added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOsinbajo said it was time for the international community to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d by meeting its commitments towards advancing growth in developing economies, especially climate change obligations.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the vice president stressed that African countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also called on the international community to support African countries to overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, \u201cbut more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nHe further urged multilateral organisations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that would not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nOn governance, Osinbajo called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders, under the auspices of ECOWAS, particularly their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and unconstitutional changes in government in the region.\n\nThe vice president was one of the 12 guests that delivered Special Addresses at this year\u2019s event during which no fewer than 25 Heads of State and Government featured generally at the virtual forum since Monday.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Vows never to let anyone impose himself on Nigerians\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, while inaugurating some projects in different parts of Kaduna State, gave a generous pass mark to the Northwestern state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, saying he was writing history in letters of gold.\n\nBuhari, who confessed to having taken El-Rufai\u2019s loyalty for granted, and went on to profusely thank him, however, vowed never to let anyone raise an army of thugs with a view to forcing himself on Nigerians, as the nation journeys through the next national elections.\n\nThe president was in Kaduna for a two-day working visit, and arrived Wednesday night from Banjul, Gambia, where he attended the inauguration of President Adama Barrow, for a second term of office.\n\nBuhari, who flew in a helicopter, landed at the Murtala Square and commissioned the remodelled Square.\n\nReceived by El-Rufai and top government functionaries, the president commenced his activities in Kafanchan, where he commissioned some road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme, before returning to Kaduna at about 11:45am.\n\nAt the Murtala Square, the new city centre of Kaduna State, the president, while admiring the remodelled edifice, recalled that he was constrained by family challenges to relocate from Daura to Kaduna, after he was released from detention as a former military Head of State.\n\n\u201dI can hardly find my way in Kaduna due to the development taking place here and the governor, has committed himself to change Kaduna for good and has been very successful at that, and Nigerians are appreciative that you are writing your history in letters of gold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet, another instance, an overly impressed Buhari added: \u201cThank you very much, Your Excellency, and remarkably, you became my governor. I don\u2019t think I have any input. Zainab became my minister of finance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you are from the gentleman I respect and go to his house (apparently referring to El-Rufai). This is fabulous coincidence and I thank God for it. Therefore, I have taken your loyalty for granted,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nStill in Kafanchan, Buhari underlined his resolve to consolidate the country\u2019s political system to improve the quality of the people\u2019s lives, because \u201cthe people matter.\u201d\n\nAddressing the palace of Alhaji Muhammadu Isa II, the Emir of Jama\u2019a, Buhari said, \u201cWe are doing our efforts to consolidate the system for the good of the people because they matter.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to speak about the use of the police and the military, in dealing with security situations but urged Nigerians to develop confidence in civil authority to build a system \u201cfree of chaos.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, reiterated that, \u201cNobody should be allowed to raise an army of thugs to force himself on the people. This must be very clear.\u201d\n\nThe president further gave assurances of the determination of his administration \u201cto hand over a better Nigeria than the one we inherited,\u201d and urged Nigerians to be fair in their assessment of what his government has achieved especially, on the campaign promises he made ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nThe president, who inaugurated the newly remodelled Murtala Mohammed Square, also unveiled the 136-bed Infectious Disease Hospital, LEA Lokoja Road Primary School, Rigasa, Aliyu Makama road and the Leventis underpass, executed by the State government.\n\nHe praised Governor El-Rufai for completing people-oriented projects in the Kaduna metropolis as well as other senatorial districts in the state.\n\nAlso, while inaugurating the 800-metre long flyover in Kawo, Kaduna, amid tight security, the president recounted how he narrowly escaped a targeted bomb attack in the vicinity in 2014.\n\nReminiscing on the unfortunate incident, which claimed the lives of many innocent Nigerians, Buhari thanked God for sparing his life on that fateful day along Ali Akilu road, Kawo-Kaduna.\n\nHis words: \u201dFor many years, I always plied this route and I cannot recount how many times I crossed it. There was an attempt on my life on this road. Nothing happened to me just like the 30 months I spent during the civil war.\n\n\u201dThey wanted to blow up the vehicle I was in around the secretariat but my escort somehow stopped them. But before we came to this bridge (Kawo), they became more desperate and there was a small market in the area, where the device exploded. But God protected us and here I am again,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter commissioning the newly constructed Dan Haya Road, Katsina Road and the Emir\u2019s Palace Road in Kafanchan, Buhari, Buhari stated again, \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the rehabilitation of the town (Kafanchan) I have seen.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents of the area to show appreciation for the projects, and commended the Emir, for his consolidation of peace among the diverse ethnic and religious communities of the Emirate.\n\nIn his remarks, El-Rufa\u2019i acknowledged the President\u2019s investments in security in the area, noting in particular that the establishment of security outfits, had paved the way for reduced attacks on people, stating categorically that Kafanchan was much safer today than it used to be.\n\nThe Emir, in acknowledging the improvements in security in the area, requested permanent bases for the Air Force and the Mobile Police, as well as the restoration of the rail services for which Kafanchan was known.\n\nBuhari was welcomed to the community by the Senator and Members of the House of Representatives from the zone, as well as a large crowd of enthusiastic citizens, who thronged the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, a combined team of heavily armed soldiers and the police were deployed to strategic places in the state while helicopters were seen hovering around the city.\n\nKaduna is one of the northwest states under constant attacks by bandits with people being killed or abducted almost on a daily basis.\n\nBuhari is expected to be in Zaria today to commission more road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nCuriously, however, the visit was without the usual fanfare and celebrations as not many people came out on the street to welcome him.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert heavy strain on the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is proposing a $50 billion trust fund which could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience and sustainability.\n\nThe trust fund is part of IMF\u2019s options for channeling some of the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued in August 2021 to countries with strong external financial positions as well as vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\n\nThe IMF in a new blog post yesterday, stated that the proposed $50 billion trust fund could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery\n\nIt stated that about three quarters of IMF\u2019s membership could qualify for the RST financing, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita gross national income (GNI) below 10 times the 2020\n\nInternational Development Association (IDA) operational cut-off , or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as\n\nGNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors; and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the Fund.\n\nThe IMF noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 per cent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIt added that RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nLike the IMF\u2019s highly concessional and currently zero interest rate Trust for low-income countries, the RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cEven as countries continue to battle COVID-19, it is crucial not to overlook the longer-term challenge of transforming economies to become more resilient to shocks and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has taught us that not addressing these long-term challenges in a timely manner can have significant economic consequences, with the potential for future balance of payments problems.\n\n\u201cClimate change is another long-term challenge that threatens macroeconomic stability and growth in many countries through natural disasters and disruptions to industries, job markets, and trade flows, among others.\n\n\u201cThese are global public policy challenges, and it is the shared responsibility of individual countries and the international community to take timely actions.\u201d\n\nThe Fund noted that in a previous blog, it had explained how it was considering options for channeling some of the $650 billion SDRs issued in August 2021 from countries with strong external financial positions to vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust.\n\nIt added that the RST\u2019s central objective was to provide affordable long-term financing to support countries as they tackle structural challenges.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve continued to work toward developing the RST, our current thinking on the key design features\u2014which we outline further below\u2014aim to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowing countries.\n\n\u201cWith broad support from the membership and international partners, we hope that the Trust can be approved by the IMF Executive Board before the upcoming Spring Meetings and for it to become fully operational before the year\u2019s end,\u201d the IMF stated in the blog post.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But we are particularly concerned about what goes on in private schools because they take their students as commodities which should be traded for money.\n\n\u201cThis is a horrible trend that will not only destroy the future of these innocent children but that of our Nigeria. We call on our governments to step in forcefully and nip this trend in the bud.\u201d\n\nThe ACF also warned the government to save the children, who have been trapped in the web of inhumanity.",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nThis lengthy time frame jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about a year and a half, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. The same year he exited his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\n\n\nChari warehouses\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\n\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy me out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for me,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport.

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Oxfordbuildbay wants you to easily own land, no matter how much you earn",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was with great joy in her heart that she put pen to paper and signed the document, officially making her a landowner in Lagos State, Nigeria. It\u2019s been a lifelong dream of hers, and she couldn\u2019t believe it was actually unfolding before her eyes. She looked at her son, Stephen, who smiled back, beaming with pride.\n\nUnfortunately, this joy would be short-lived. Sadly, Mrs Nwachukwu fell victim to the product of years of anarchy and regulatory laxity and lost the land she bought with her hard-earned money. This experience left a bad taste with Stephen, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he needed to find a solution and immediately contacted his friend, Olamilekan.\n\nThis experience was not unique to Olamilekan Adeniji and Stephen Nwachuckwu, Co-founders of Oxfordbuildbay, a real estate tech startup working to solve problems they\u2019ve experienced first hand.\n\n\u201cWe found that there\u2019s a constant issue around omo onile (traditional landowners), there\u2019s the issue around finding out who actually owns the land. God help you, you might not even get it, or they take you to somewhere farther than you had bargained for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter this experience, we began thinking of ways to use technology to make land ownership more seamless, and affordable for the average Nigerian,\u201d says Nwachukwu\n\nThe entry barrier to real estate in Nigeria is significantly high for speculative investors and those who simply want their own homes. A 2019 survey of 5,000 Nigerians showed that 62 \u2013 63% of owned land comes by family inheritance, and just 18% bought theirs outrightly.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit is more pronounced in urban areas than rural areas. Due to the high living costs, lands in places like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt are prohibitively expensive.\n\nHomeownership stands at 73% in rural areas, compared to 35% in urban areas. Increasing urban migration and continued pressure on infrastructure is worsening Nigeria\u2019s property ownership situation.\n\nIf you check these listings on Jiji, for example, you\u2019ll find a plot of land in Lekki, Lagos, going for \u20a612 billion ($29 million). More than enough money to bankroll the Series A rounds for Paystack and Flutterwave. But you\u2019ll also see a listing as low as \u20a6140,000 in a less developed part of Lagos.\n\nRegardless of what you opt for, you\u2019d still have to deal with uncertainties and the disturbances of omo oniles, who people have come to regard as louts.\n\nSo far, regulatory attention has not featured as effectively as it should in Nigeria\u2019s property space, but Adeniji and Nwachukwu were not about to wait for the government to set things right.\n\nToday, the company they built offers people the chance to pay for lands with as little as \u20a6250 daily for two years, after which it becomes fully theirs. But the journey was a tough one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBraving stormy waters\n\nComing from a background in finance, Nwachukwu sought out Adeniji, who had entrepreneurial experience, to seek a solution for people with similar stories to his mum\u2019s. Nwachukwu recounts that he attended Techpoint Inspired 2019, and he and his partner were inspired to build a product that would solve Nigeria\u2019s housing problems. They called it Buildbay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders of Oxfordbuildbay: Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth (left), Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 MD (right). Source: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the failure of regulations, but we felt there was something we could do to solve the problem. First, we thought we could excuse the omo oniles, so you could trust that the land you buy from the comfort of your home is actually genuine and is verifiable,\u201d Nwachukwu says.\n\nAdeniji points out that it would be very difficult to verify if the omo onile selling a property to you is the actual owner of that land.\n\n\u201cMaybe someone leads you to another person, who then takes you to another family who owns the land. There are always long chains like these,\u201d he reveals.\u201cWhen a company approaches the government to get land, or they approach these same omo oniles, it\u2019s usually a different ball game than when an individual approaches them.\n\nAdeniji opines that the idea was to create a safety net for individuals who do not have the financial might or connection to fend off bullies and poachers from their properties.\n\nFor this to happen, the two founders had to acquire large amounts of land and sort out issues with the omo oniles themselves. If you\u2019ve followed my analysis this far, you can surmise that this would cost a ton of money.\n\nWith no venture capital funding, Buildbay got in talks with Oxford International Group, a multisectoral business empire, that bought into the founders\u2019 vision and absorbed Buildbay to birth the company, Oxfordbuildbay.\n\nWith the platform fully launched, the company had to find ways to onboard users who would appreciate the solution it came up with.\n\n\u201cWe had to leverage the real estate agent network who penetrated deep into the market and pretty much helped onboard people on the platform we built. These guys would go into markets, schools, and several other places. We also had to employ cooperatives because they had a large number of people who would need the products we were offering,\u201d Adeniji explains.\n\nWith the resounding success of this aggressive offline marketing, the company could automate the whole process and limit human interaction as much as possible. Customers could now take their pick of land across Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo and pay with their cards or connect their accounts, so they are automatically debited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nAnother major issue the startup had to tackle was the reputation of hidden charges among real estate developers. To do this, it took up the task of educating people.\n\nLike most founders, getting the right talent became paramount, and they actively sought people who would buy into the company\u2019s vision.\n\nIt looked for talent in industries similar to theirs but also took bets on teachable people who displayed a willingness to learn.\n\n\u201cSometimes we found that the people we hired had bought the product before, so selling our vision to them was a no-brainer,\u201d Adeniji states excitedly.\n\nThis strategy, Adeniji opines, has helped Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s mission so far.\n\nHow Oxfordbuildbay works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxfordbuildbay has optimised its entire process to work for the different kinds of visitors to its website.\n\n\u201cWhen less tech-savvy users head to the website, www.oxfordbuildbay.com, there\u2019s a WhatsApp popup that is so in your face. When you click it, it links you to a support agent who then walks you through the whole process from start to finish,\u201d Nwachukwu explains.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you could simply create an account, log in to your dashboard, click on the land locations, which will bring out the different land locations we have as of today, and then click on buy. It takes you to the cart, and you also get to choose your payment frequency before you pay.\n\nTypically, getting lands from real estate developers usually comes with other hidden or inexplicable charges, but Nwachukwu insists that there\u2019s nothing of the sort with Oxfordbuildbay.\n\n\u201cAll of these with zero allocation fee, zero agency fee, zero documentation fee and allocation can be between the 6th and 12th months while the payment is ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put that in perspective, we\u2019ve helped Nigerians save over N2.3 billion on agency, legal and \u2018omo onile\u2019 fees when acquiring a land,\u201d claims Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve made the payment, you get an offer letter which gives the purchase details \u2014 the size of land you bought, the location you picked, what you have paid, and what is left to pay.\u201d\n\nOxfrordbuildbay measures its lands in small units called \u201cSlots\u201d, which is half a plot. Its plots are usually 300 square metres on Lagos Mainland and everywhere else, and 250 square metres on the Island.\n\nThere are regularly scheduled site inspection visits at different intervals, and any customer can request an inspection for a small fee.\n\nThe startup recently launched its Android app, and its IoS app, creating a fresh avenue for users to access the platform, and begin their land ownership.\n\nBusiness model and expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Akinyinka Akinpelu \u2013 Head of Business, Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth, Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 Managing Director and CEO, Oxfordbuildbay. Source: Supplied.\n\nWithout sharing any specific figures, Nwachukwu insists that Oxfordbuilbay\u2019s entire process ensures that the company is profitable.\n\nHe argues that the company\u2019s business model allows it to capture people from different rungs of the social ladder, and it\u2019s helping to create constant cash flow and make the business sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are upstream financially who are interested in the trust and certainty we offer, as well as people who are looking for affordable and flexible options to own a property.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu likens this strategy to the sachet milk strategy. He states that the company has already acquired huge expanses of land over time, these lands have appreciated, and it made perfect business sense to sell them in little affordable bits.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, it all adds up,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cour mission to democratise homeownership is quite different from any other player out there.\u201d\n\nIt has also put systems in place to deter people from defaulting on payments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say life happens, we wait for 1, 2, and 3 months and there\u2019s still no payment, we adjust the pricing for the land, so you start paying for the land at a reviewed price that factors in land appreciation. Customers who do not default continue to pay for the land at the price it was when they started paying.\u201d\n\nSeveral other factors could lead people to default on payments in a country like Nigeria, and Oxfordbuildbay has a little fail-safe.\n\n\u201cKnowing that health can be a major deterrent when making long term payments like this, we have partnered with an HMO to offer free health insurance to customers who consistently pay for three months.\u201d\n\nWhile this might seem quite generous, the company has an end goal in mind. As Nwachukwu pointed out earlier, the margins actually make sense at the end.\n\n\u201cLike any business, we obviously want to make a profit. But our primary goal is to democratise homeownership and become the brand that Africans come to for their homeownership needs.\u201d\n\nSo far, Nwachukwu reveals that the company has been bootstrapping, but it is looking for funding to expand its offerings which are fast gaining traction across West Africa.\n\nOxfordbuildbay has 20,000 consistent customers, and it has visions of expanding across Nigeria and to other African countries.\n\nNigeria\u2019s property sector has been filled with exciting innovations in recent years, but Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s value proposition is quite compelling, and it creates room for excitement and possibly other similar down-to-earth solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

Prof. Balogun, made the call while delivering his paper titiled Green Manufacturing: A Novel Approach to Economic Recovery in Nigeria, at the 3rd Inaugural lecture series of the Edo State University Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government, Edo State.\n\nThe Don said Nigeria should capitalized on her population of over 200 million people in order to explore, penetrate and create strong market for its manufacturing sector.\n\nBalogun a Professor in the Deparment of Mechanical Engeering, Edo State University Uzairue said the solution to economic poverty in the country is technological revolution and self sufficiently in the production of green consumer goods which can only be avhieved through green manufacturing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe way forward is for Nigeria to take advantage of the green manufacturing strategy and evolve her manufacturing sector in that direction as we move toward s the 4th industrial revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of manufacturing machining in our nation to be specific needs a step change to enhance sustainability and transformation towards green,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nation, cannot continue to depend on imported technology and food, and expect to be classified as a developed nation.\n\n\u201cRather, we need to employ and develop our green manufacturing sector so that we can create more jobs and take our citizens out of the streets\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Balogun noted that the manufacturing sector provides the greatest opportunity for the transformation of the Nigerian economy, saying that it is an antidote for unemployment, a creator of wealth and threshold for sustainable development.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough manufacturing in Nigeria has a few challenges; among them are inadequate and epileptic power supply, regulatory issues, multiplicities of taxes, trade facilitation issues and infrastructural deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThere are some area of strengths that Nigeria could build on if she considers the new trend of green manufacturing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further described green manufacturing as a products through economically-sound processes that minimise negative environmental impact while conserving energy and natural resources.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a gateway and key to competitive economy. The competitiveness of manufacturing and support for sustainable development demand new aporoaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an urgret call at all levels of manufacturing to curtail the emission rate as proposed by United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to meet the sustsinable agenda in order to help cushion the impact of electrical energy consumption on the environment during manufacturing processes\u201d he said.\n\nThe Don said that green manufacturing technology are increasingly becoming more attractive globally for the production of consumer products, adding that it minimises and eliminates processing and production waste using eco-efficient practices and new environmental technology at all levels of manufacturing activities.\n\nHe said Nigerian manufacturing sector contributes 4.19 per cent to the national GDP, saying that for Nigeria to be one of the 20 biggest economies in the world in 2020, the sector must be contributing a minimum of 15 per cent yearly to its GDP and grow it steadily to a minimum of 30 per cent by 2021.\n\nHe urged manufacturers operating in the country to key into the green manufacturing technology for the manufacturing of their products.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a national call to the development of environmentally friendly manufacturing factor, concepts, methods and tools that are important in design and manufacturing of discrete products in order to minimise the life cycle cost due to environmental demage.\n\n\u201cFor green manufacturing to thrive, there has to be an understanding and advocacy on the modus operandi towards green mechanical machining processes.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore compelling on all manufacturers including Nigerian manufacturers to engage in discussion that boils around the reduction of CO2 levels through the minimum consumption of fossil fuels and other parameters to encourage green manufsctures of products,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

          "text": "Pastor Tavner Smith\u2019s Venue Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States began in 2012 in an old building that once belonged to old Sam\u2019s Club.\n\nIt grew in leaps and bounds, such that every Sunday, up to 2,000 worshippers congregated in the church by 2020.\n\nBy 2015, Venue was on Outreach Magazine\u2019s list of fastest-growing churches in the U.S.A.\n\nThereafter, the church began to unravel, triggered by the misdemeanours of its founder, Tavner Smith.\n\nHis extra-marital affair with a married female church member, his divorce with his wife, aggressive drives for membership, tithes and donations have combined to destroy the fast growing church.\n\nMembers have quit in droves, but not before the pastor had grown rich on the tithes collected, buying up properties and treating himself with designer wears and new cars.\n\n\u201cIn January 2021, Smith announced to the congregation what many staff and volunteers already suspected: He and his wife were splitting for good. He said the board had asked him to take a break from preaching and attend six weeks of counseling. But two weeks later, according to multiple former attendees, he was back at the pulpit, claiming God had told him to return.\n\n\u201cAs the situation at Venue deteriorated, Smith\u2019s sermons took on an air of desperation. He started calling people out in public for not donating enough and spoke frequently about not associating with \u201cthe enemy\u201d\u2014which some took to mean the people who had left the church. The final straw for some was a 16-week series Smith hosted called \u201cDirty Destinies,\u201d which centered around people in the Bible who had done terrible things but later recovered.\n\n\u201cIt was at that point that I started saying, \u2018Is this to make him feel better about his decisions?\u2019\u201d one attendee said. \u201cWe were kind of like, at that point, how much longer is this going to drag out?\u201d\n\nThat former attendee said she had given Smith the benefit of the doubt for months. Both she and her husband had talked to Smith and his alleged paramour, respectively, and both had denied the affair. She figured it was nothing more than a friendship gone a little too far\u2014but still, something in the church felt off. She and her husband were discussing their reservations last month when someone from the church sent them a video. It showed Smith and his employee sitting close together in a restaurant, looking friendly, until she leaned in for what appeared to be a very discreet kiss.\n\n\u201cAt that point we were just kind of like, \u2018OK that\u2019s the physical evidence,\u2019\u201d the former attendee recalled. \u201cThat was the moment that we were like, \u2018That\u2019s what we needed.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith quickly called a meeting with staff and employees to address the video, which was circulating quickly online. The former church member and her husband were in attendance, and said the pastor was evasive and refused to answer questions directly. She said she was stunned by his seeming lack of concern.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing: He has no remorse,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody told me he sees nothing wrong with the decision because he truly believes that\u2019s what God told them to do.\u201d\n\nRead more in Daily Beast:",

By the time you left office, Nigeria was totally set free, direct foreign investment was on the increase on a daily basis and we were respected in the international community and everywhere we went.\n\n\u201cToday, this clueless APC and President Muhammadu Buhari undone that and has plunged Nigeria into eternal debt. The new debt overhang created by this wicked government is going to create massive problems for the coming generations.\n\n\u201cI remember when I accompanied you as your Minister to a number of countries \u2013 Germany and India \u2013 I saw the respect they accorded you and I was very proud to be a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cToday, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the same recognition because what we have become has fallen short of good leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cThis is on account of worsening insecurity and Buhari\u2019s creation of a Nigeria regarded as the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cApart from the Infrastructural intervention which you did, most of the very useful institutions like EFCC, the ICPC and so on are now being used to hound people.\n\n\u201cOver these years that you are in power, you saw every Nigerian as one family, you didn\u2019t discriminate against the south, the east, the west or the north. Even though, in your first tenure, the South West didn\u2019t actually support you, but, you brought them back on board and they supported you in your second tenure and that was an achievement.\n\n\u201cToday, Buhari\u2019s nepotism has divided Nigerians just as his other actions have further created wedges between fellow countrymen and women,\u201d Ayu alleged.\n\nEarlier, Obasanjo had said he would not return to the PDP, but he will be available to offer advice to people who seek the same, saying he remained committed to his stance that partisan politics was no longer for him.\n\nHe prayed for and wished Dr Ayu and the new leadership of PDP well.",

But we negotiated and I first gave them N2 million.\n\n\u201cThey collected the money in Rigasa area of Kaduna. Later, they called me again and demanded for another N1.045m as the only condition to release my daughter.\n\n\u201cI did not argue. But I gave the money to them. However, after paying the ransom as demanded on the 19th of January, they called me to tell me they have killed her, and switched off their phone. From the initial stage, I was following her abductors and doing their bidding because of the fear of losing her. Now, they have killed her.\n\n\u201cI know those who abducted her and killed her. They are around us. I have strong evidence. I have told the police. And they are on it. Infact the suspects have been arrested,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts made to seek confirmation from the police were futile as the Kaduna state Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), ASP Muhammed Jalige, failed to respond to messages sent to him by the media as at the time of filing the report.",

          "text": "The 71-year old rivalry between Nigeria and Ghana on the football field will hit a combustible point in March when the Super Eagles and the Black Stars battle for a single ticket to the FIFA World Cup finals in Qatar.\n\nAccording to the draw for the Qatar 2022 African series play-off draw held in Yaounde on Saturday evening, four \u2013time African champions Ghana will host the first leg with the reverse encounter in Nigeria, both to hold between 24th \u2013 29th March.\n\nThe draw was conducted by Samson Adamu, CAF\u2019s Director of Competitions and African football legends El Hadj Diouf and Emmanuel Adebayor.\n\nThe Super Eagles emerged from a group comprising themselves, Liberia, Cape Verde and Central African Republic to be eligible for the play-offs, while the Black Stars prevailed over South Africa 1-0 on the final day in an explosive and controversial duel in Cape Coast.

          "title": "Russia Toughens Posture Amid Ukraine Tensions",
          "text": "With tens of thousands of Russian troops positioned near Ukraine, the Kremlin has kept the U.S. and its allies guessing about its next moves in the worst security crisis to emerge between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.\n\nAmid fears of an imminent attack on Ukraine, Russia has further upped the ante by announcing more military drills in the region. It also has refused to rule out the possibility of military deployments to the Caribbean, and President Vladimir Putin has reached out to leaders opposed to the West.\n\nThe military muscle-flexing reflects a bold attempt by the Kremlin to halt decades of NATO expansion after the end of the Cold War. In talks with the United States, Russia demands legally binding guarantees that the alliance will not embrace Ukraine and other former Soviet nations, or place weapons there. It also wants NATO to pull back its forces from countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the alliance since the 1990s.\n\nPutin has described NATO membership for Ukraine and the others as well as the alliance\u2019s weapons deployments there as a red line for Moscow, warning that he would order unspecified \u201cmilitary-technical measures\u201d if the demands aren\u2019t met.\n\nPutin pointed to NATO drills with the Ukrainian military, increasingly frequent visits of the alliance warships in the Black Sea and the flights of U.S. bombers near Crimea to emphasize the urgency of Russia\u2019s security demands. He argued that by creating training centers in Ukraine, Western powers can establish a military foothold there even without its joining NATO.\n\n\u201cWe have nowhere to retreat,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey have taken it to the point where we simply must tell them: \u2018Stop!\u2019\u201d\n\nRussia, which annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, has denied it intends to attack its neighbor. Last year, however, Putin issued a stark warning that an attempt by Ukraine to reclaim control of the areas in the east controlled by Russia-backed separatists would have \u201cgrave consequences for Ukrainian statehood.\u201d\n\nWhile Ukrainian authorities denied planning such offensive, U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Russia had already deployed operatives to carry out acts of sabotage in the rebel east and blame them on Ukraine in a \u201cfalse-flag operation\u201d to create a pretext for possible invasion. Russia has rejected the claim as \u201ctotal disinformation.\u201d\n\nPutin has repeatedly asserted that Russians and Ukrainians are \u201cone people,\u201d and says large chunks of Ukrainian territory are historic parts of Russia \u2014 arbitrarily granted to Ukraine by Communist leaders during Soviet times.\n\nOver 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting in Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland called the Donbas, where the Moscow-supported insurgency erupted shortly after the annexation of Crimea. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but a political settlement has stalled, and frequent skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact.\n\nEarlier this year, a spike in cease-fire violations in the east and a Russian troop concentration near Ukraine ignited the invasion fears, but tensions abated when Moscow pulled back the bulk of its forces after maneuvers in April.\n\nThe military buildup near Ukraine resumed in the fall, with Ukrainian and Western officials warning that the increasing troop concentration could herald a multipronged Russian attack.\n\nPutin noted with satisfaction that Russia has caused a \u201ccertain stress\u201d in the West. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to keep them in that condition for as long as possible,\u201d he said in November, ordering his diplomats to push for binding guarantees against NATO expansion.\n\nWhile the U.S. and its allies rejected the Russian demands for a halt to NATO expansion, some observers note that Moscow\u2019s insistence on a written reply may reflect an intention to use it as an argument for a possible escalation.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, the parties don\u2019t intend to compromise and want to shift responsibility for a potential conflict,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, a Moscow-based independent analyst.\n\nAdding to an estimated 100,000 troops deployed near Ukraine, Russia also has moved more troops from Siberia and the Far East for joint drills with its ally Belarus, which also borders Ukraine. In those exercises, Russian military units have moved to areas near Belarus\u2019 southern border, which is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) from Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this week, the Russian Defense Ministry also announced a series of naval maneuvers in the Black Sea and more distant areas such as the Mediterranean, northeastern Atlantic and the Pacific. The exercises that will start this month and last through February would involve over 140 ships, dozens of aircraft and more than 10,000 personnel.\n\nAmid the tensions, Putin also worked to strengthen alliances with the countries opposed to the West. He has hosted Iran\u2019s hard-line president for talks on expanding cooperation and is set to travel to the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing where he will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn recent days, Putin also spoke by phone with the leaders of Nicaragua and Venezuela, and a Russian government plane was recently seen cruising between Cuba and Venezuela in a possible harbinger of the next Kremlin moves.\n\nAfter the U.S. and its allies rejected Russia\u2019s demands for a halt to NATO expansion, Russia\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov kept the door open for the deployment of military assets to Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nWhile voicing concern that NATO could potentially use Ukrainian territory for the deployment of missiles capable of reaching Moscow in just five minutes, Putin has warned that Russian warships armed with the latest Zircon hypersonic cruise missile would give Russia a similar capability if deployed in neutral waters.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a leading Russian foreign policy expert, observed that with Russia and the West taking intransigent stands in the talks, an escalation appears inevitable.\n\n\u201cTensions will be high, including demonstrations of force not necessarily near or in Ukraine,\u201d Lukyanov wrote in a commentary. \u201cReal talks with some room for maneuvering and a broader agenda would ideally begin only after the next round of escalation in order to ease tensions.\u201d",
