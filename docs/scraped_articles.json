          "title": "Time\u2019ll tell if Sanwo-Olu\u2019s VAT interest is for Lagosians \u2013Politician who clashed with Remi Tinubu",
          "text": "A Lagos-based politician, Arinola Oloko, has said that time will tell whether Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is pursuing the goal for Lagos State to collect Value Added Tax generated within its territory for residents or his political godfathers.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party candidate for the Lagos State House of Assembly, Eti-Osa Constituency 2 in 2019, made this known in an interview with Sunday PUNCH on Friday.\n\nThe educationist had been captured in a viral video objecting to being called a \u2018thug\u2019 by Senator Oluremi Tinubu at the venue of the public hearing on constitution review in May this year.\n\nOloko backed Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Sanwo-Olu, for championing the agitation for fiscal federalism for states in the country, saying the autonomy for states was becoming a reality.\n\nVAT is a consumption tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt last month in a judgment in suit number FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, held that the Rivers State Government had the powers to collect VAT within its territory.\n\nAlthough the Federal Inland Revenue Service applied to the court for stay of execution, Justice Stephen Pam rejected the application, saying granting it would negate the principle of equity.\n\nThe Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Friday, however, asked the parties to maintain the status quo.\n\nWIke, who lamented the injustice in the country, had said Rivers State generated N15bn VAT revenue in June this year, but got N4.7bn in return, while Kano generated N2.8bn in the same month and got the same N2.8bn back.\n\nHe had said that N46.4bn was collected from Lagos State in the same month but the Federal Government gave Lagos N9.3bn. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t want to believe these things exist,\u201d he added.\n\nWike had also assented to the Rivers State VAT Law 2021 in August after it was passed by the state House of Assembly.\n\nSome states have since followed. Sanwo-Olu on Friday signed the state VAT bill into law a day after it was passed by the Lagos State House of Assembly.\n\nLagos also asked to be joined as a respondent alongside Rivers State in the appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service challenging the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt regarding the issue of VAT collection.\n\nJustice Haruna Tsammani of the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Friday adjourned to September 16 to hear the application by Lagos and asked all parties to maintain status quo.\n\nCommenting on the move by Lagos, Oloko said, \u201cIt is a brilliant thing to do. Lagos is the Centre of Excellence and with the amount of things that come out of Lagos, it is a good thing for the money not to go out of the state. We generate the VAT. The state would have some financial control without going to Abuja for peanuts.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government can\u2019t be collecting the money for something that we consume and produce here and at the end of the day, the state is always waiting on the Federal Government before they get anything.\u201d\n\nThe politician said governors must be accountable to the people and not to their godfathers.\n\n\u201cWhether he is doing it in the interest of his godfathers or not, whatever it is, this has helped to open our eyes to the fact that we need to elect leaders that are accountable and take us into consideration.\n\n\u201cThis is an eye-opener for what is ahead. We have all been talking about autonomy, this is a tip of the iceberg of what it would look like when we finally have autonomy and what the governors would be able to do and what they cannot do. It is now up to us to say that this VAT that would be collected, will it be beneficial to us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf he (Sanwo-Olu) is doing it for someone else or for his people (Lagosians), we would know, time would tell. But everyone should open their eyes now and ask for accountability and where the money is going into.\n\n\u201cMy word for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is that it is time for accountability, we want him to be accountable, transparent, and responsive towards Lagosians. There are people out there waiting to follow how the money is going to be spent if the state wins its VAT war.\n\n\u201cIt is chance for him to show that when autonomy really comes, he would do the right thing and stand for the people of Lagos State and not for anybody else, I don\u2019t want to name names. He should apply it to where it should go to. He should not just look at the money but know that we are watching and responsibility comes with the money.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Dateline: How Ndigbo recorded remarkable \u2018Presidential Week\u2019",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was overwhelmingly surprised by the massive support and solidarity accorded him and members of his entourage by South East stakeholders as well as thousands of residents of the zone during his Thursday\u2019s official visit to Imo.\n\nThe president believed that Gov. Hope Uzodinma of Imo had made it a remarkable and joyful week for him following the successful visit.\n\nThe Nigerian leader said he least expected the calibre of personalities that came to welcome and interact with him during the townhall meeting with the stakeholders on the fateful day.\n\nWhile acknowledging the resourcefulness and enterprising spirit of Igbo people, the president declared that:\n\n\u2018\u2018The fundamental thing about the Igbo people is that there is no town you will visit in Nigeria without seeing the Igbos being in-charge of either infrastructure or pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, it is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos are in charge of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe promised that the Federal Government would complete ongoing development key projects in the South East, including the 2nd Niger Bridge as well as the railway lines and routes linking the region with other parts of the country.\n\nBuhari had earlier inaugurated four projects executed by Uzodinma, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that I will support Imo State within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks at the townhall meeting, Uzodinma said Ndigbo believed in a united Nigeria predicated on \u2018\u2018justice, equity and fairness\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe thanked the president for addressing the interests of Ndi Igbo through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the ongoing construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge, among others.\n\nThe governor also commended the president for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos into two key international organisations \u2013 Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu as Assistant Director-General of Health Emergency Intelligence, World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIn his remarks, the President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor, assured Buhati of the continuous support of Ndigbo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nA cross section of indigenes of the South East zone, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Buhari\u2019s official visit to Imo on Sept. 9, thanked the Nigerian leader for his passion and love for the people of the South East region of the country.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of National Land Development Authority (NALDA), Mr Paul Ikonne, said:\n\n\u201dThis visit is very significant and shows the love of the president and it shows he is the president of Nigeria and he has jurisdiction in all the states.\n\n\u201dIt also shows his passion, and that he always loved and still loves the Southeast. His first outing to contest, he used an Igbo man as his Vice-President.\n\n\u201dIn his second outing he did the same too. In 2015, the president gave Igbo people four solid ministries, with substantive ministers, and the chain of other ministries.\n\n\u201dNow look at the Aba-Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway that has been abandoned for years, today the road is not only motorable but standard that you can travel from Aba to Enugu without potholes.\n\n\u201dLook at the second Niger Bridge which was also abandoned for years, today that project is nearing completion. This is just to mention but a few.\n\n\u201dThe President\u2019s coming shows that he loves the Igbo and he will keep doing more for the Igbo.\u201d\n\nThe president had on Sept. 6 virtually declared open the 47th African Insurance Organisation (AIO) Conference and Annual General Assembly where he urged insurance firms in Nigeria to take advantage of ongoing efforts by the Federal Government to grow the non-oil sector of the economy through innovation.\n\nHe commended the role of insurance firms in encouraging medical practitioners to tackle the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to him, the insurance sector will play a vital role in the diversification of the economy by bringing necessary stability, economic sustainability, revenue generation, job creation and financial inclusivity.\n\n\u201cThere is a great future for the insurance industry in Africa. We only need to put the right mechanisms in place for it to thrive. I assure you that this administration has and will continue to support insurance growth in Nigeria and Africa at large.\n\nAlso on Sept. 6, the president hosted Gov. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe governor, who spoke to State House correspondents at the end of the closed door meeting with the president, revealed that Buhari would soon inaugurate 20 projects successfully executed by the State Government to uplift the quality of life of the people.\n\nUmahi, who prayed to God to give Nigeria next president (in 2023) with good heart like Buhari, commended the president for the execution of mega projects in the South Eastern part of the country.\n\nHe maintained that such projects, when completed, would have great impact on the people of the region.\n\nAlso on Sept. 6, Buhari hosted Rotary International President, Mr Shekhar Mehta, and some officials, at the State House, Abuja.\n\nHe thanked the Rotary Club for its various interventions in the health sector, particularly putting in 268 million dollars in the fight against Polio.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian leader, the Federal Government will continue drawing from the expertise, partnership and consistency learnt from the eradication of Polio in the country to strengthen the health sector.\n\n\u201cNigeria has benefitted from your kind support, most particularly in the fight against Polio, with a total sum of 268 million dollars provided by Rotary International. For this, I say thank you.\n\nSimilarly, the president on Sept. 6, approved the setting up of a Health Sector Reform Committee, to be chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, for development and implementation of a Health Sector Reform programme for Nigeria.\n\nThe committee would also work in collaboration with State Governments and the FCT administration.\n\nOther members of the committee are: Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta; Dr Osagie Ehanire, Minister of Health; Mr Alex Okoh, Director General, BPE; Prof. Ibrahim Abubakar, Professor in Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University College London and Director of the UCL Institute for Global Health.\n\nMr Babatunde Irukera, the Director General, Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council; Sen. Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe; Dr Adedamola Dada; Dr Sani Aliyu and Dr Mairo Mandara would also serve in the committee.\n\nOthers are: Dr Haliru Yahaya, Emir of Shonga; Prof. Uche Amazigbo; Director Hospital Services, Federal Ministry of Health; Dr Faisal Shuaib; Prof. Nasiru Sambo; Dr Ifedayo Morayo Adetifa, and Dr Gambo Aliyu.\n\nOther members of the committee are Dr Betta Edu (Chairman, Nigeria Health Commissioners Forum, representing National Council on Health); President, Nigeria Medial Association; and President, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria.\n\nThe President, National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives; President, Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria; Mrs Temi Marcella Awogboro; Dr Muhammad Sadiq; Dr Azubike Tagbo, and World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Nigeria are also members of the committee.\n\nVesta Healthcare Partners and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would serve as resources persons, with observer roles in the committee.\n\nBuhari had also approved the appointment of Dr Ifedayo Morayo Adetifa, who is also a member of the committee, as the new Director General of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nThe president, on Sept. 7, received the Saudi Arabian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Faisal Al-Saud, where he maintained that the oil rich kingdom has been quite kind to Nigeria.\n\nBuhari observed that with Nigeria\u2019s large population and infrastructure deficit, the country needed all the revenue she could get from oil, a mainstay of the economy, \u201cand Saudi Arabia has been very kind to us, making sacrifice by reducing production to accommodate us a number of times\u201d.\n\nBuhari also presided over the routine meeting of the National Security Council on Sept. 7, where he reiterated the commitment of his administration to safeguard the lives and property of all citizens irrespective of their socio-economic status in the society.\n\nOn Sept. 8, the president chaired the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), during which the council approved the policy on deployment of Fifth Generation network, popularly known as 5-G\n\nNAN also reports that the council also approved a National Policy on Food and Nutrition as part of deliberate efforts to ensure healthy workforce in the country.\n\nMalam Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, confirmed this when he briefed State House correspondents on the outcome of the council meeting.\n\nAccording to him, following the approval of the new policy, there will be budgetary provisions for food and nutrition in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government and possibly in all tiers of government.\n\nHe also revealed that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice was given the go ahead with the process for ratification of Nigeria\u2019s occupational safety and health convention of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which was passed in 2006.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, the resolution seeks to enhance safety and healthcare in work places across the country.\n\nShehu also disclosed that the council approved N1.2 billion for emergency repairs of water supply facilities in Nasarawa State.\n\nAccording to him, the approval follows the need to fix water pipelines destroyed by floods in the state.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari meets with NMA members\n\nThe Minister of Power, Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu, who also addressed the correspondents on the outcome of the FEC meeting, disclosed that the council approved N470.8 billion for the purchase of maintenance equipment for the nation\u2019s power sector.\n\nAlso during the week under review, the First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs Aisha Buhari, called on well-meaning citizens to come to the aid of victims of insurgency and banditry, particularly on the education of children from the States affected by security challenges.\n\nShe made the appeal during an inspection tour of a school built by the Aisha Buhari Foundation (ABF) in Maiduguri, Borno, on Sept. 7.\n\nNAN reports that the school, which has been completed and named Future Assured College, has attracted the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Victims Support Fund (VSF).\n\nIn an address read by the Board Secretary of the Aisha Buhari Foundation, Mrs Halima Buhari-Sheriff, the First Lady expressed optimism that the school would provide an opportunity for the children of the less privileged to get quality education and grow into future generational leaders.\n\nAlso Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo represented President Buhari at a virtual Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS member-states on the political developments in the Republics of Guinea and Mali on Sept. 8\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201dThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) must take proactive steps to prevent coups d\u2019etat in the sub-region, and even on the continent, because the unconstitutional seizure of power in any shape or form is simply unacceptable and has no place in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nNAN reports that the meeting, attended by 10 of the ECOWAS leaders, alongside others, including representatives from the United Nations, came after Guinean President Alpha Conde was ousted by a coup d\u2019etat in the West African country on Sept. 5.\n\nThis culminated in his arrest and detention by the country\u2019s military junta, the dissolution of the Guinean Government, suspension of the Constitution, and a military takeover.\n\nWhile stating Nigeria\u2019s position on the unfortunate development in Guinea, Osinbajo said: \u201cI join all well-meaning global leaders to express in the strongest terms the condemnation of the Government of Nigeria of this unconstitutional change of Government; a development that could seriously destabilise the Republic of Guinea.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president also on Sept. 9, attended the funeral service of Pa Abiodun, father of Gov. Dapo Abiodun of Ogun.\n\nOsinbajo noted that the late Pa Abiodun was \u201ca rare breed, a man who served his family, his community, his nation, and his God; and he served them well.\u201d\n\nBuhari concluded the week with an appeal to striking health workers to return to their duty posts, urging others contemplating strikes to opt for settlement of issues by negotiation, no matter how long it takes.\n\nThe president made the appeal when he hosted members of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) at the State House, Abuja, on Sept. 10.\n\nAccording to the president, the lives of citizens that can be lost or damaged when doctors withdraw services, are precious enough to be worth opting for peaceful resolution of differences.\n\nBuhari assured that all outstanding benefits owed medical doctors would be cleared after verifications, noting that embarking on industrial action at a critical health period for the country and citizens is not a good option.\n\n\u201cProtecting our citizens is not to be left to government alone, but taken as a collective responsibility, in which especially medical professionals play a critical role,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\n\nNAN",

          "title": "If Delta PDP Must Win in 2023",
          "text": "By Ovie Edomi\n\nPolitical scientists, social commentators and analysts have recently been presenting diverse postulations and speculations about the workings and emerging interests and concerns of various stalwarts of the ruling party in Delta State and with special reference to the body language of the incumbent governor of Delta State: Senator Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThis development is naturally expected and very welcome in view of the fact that the party primaries for the selection of a governorship candidate for the impending 2023 gubernatorial elections is less than a year from now. Another congruent milestone development is the growing number of very important personalities, distinguished Deltans who have expressed their interest in the governorship position of the State.\n\nREAD ALSO:PDP wins Delta Assembly by-election\n\nSignificantly, the personal interest and disposition of the incumbent Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa who naturally has some latitudes, to tango or tilt the election pendulum depending on the flexibility allowed into the election process by the key stakeholders of the PDP. Whatever it is and however the process works out, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa as the incumbent governor definitely has a significant role to play in the determination, implementation and implications of the 2023 gubernatorial political process in Delta State as the chief umpire and moderator of the event. Without whim, fantasy or exaggeration, this is a very important role in Senator Ifeanyi Okowa\u2019s political career and he will no doubt by his implicit and explicit actions in this event be creating and keeping a very memorable date with history.\n\nFortunately, perhaps the most remarkable and outstanding character which personifies and has typified his administration to Deltans is INTEGRITY. This characteristic feature has either been desecrated, relegated or abandoned in the Nigerian political space. INTEGRITY has become like the proverbial narrow way in the Bible, which the Bible declares is hard to find and by few. Needless therefore to say that many Nigerian politicians are crooked and disgruntled without any moral fiber of integrity, being blown and swayed only by fleeting considerations of pedestrian mercurial benefits and inglorious, uncanny, heroism.\n\nThey rise to notorious unpopularity by shameless, conscienceless despicable monstrosity, which evaporates into thin air soon after their inglorious exit from political office. This is where fortunately Delta and Deltans are blessed by having one of the rare men who have displayed and are ruled by principled INTEGRITY, obviously through influences of family background and personal inclination.\n\nAnyone who has keenly observed and followed the trajectory of recruitments, appointments, transfers, promotions, contract awards and general administrative business of the 1st tenure and thus far into the 2nd tenure of Governor Okowa would easily attest that the defining character and quality of his administration is INTEGRITY.\n\nThere are three critical trimesters in the threshold of an administration, political or otherwise. The process of acquiring or coming into power, the process of dispensing (implementing) power, and the last stage which pertains to the process of terminating or leaving power. Interestingly and fortunately, the first and second stages of the Okowa administration have transpired very well by the special grace of God and the goodwill and cooperation of well-meaning Deltans. To keep up the tide therefore, the Governor should give special attention to the political activities and election rituals surrounding his exit from office, which would determine the very crucial issue of a successor who would take his achievements in office, his party and the entire state to the NEXT LEVEL positively.\n\nThe Governor Okowa I know is a political juggernaut who knows very well that he would be remembered for a long time, on how he plays the politics of who replaces him to carry on his massive political legacies. On a personal note of advice, if I were Governor Okowa and I have by the special grace of God started well and achieved the lofty heights in governance, I will certainly be very careful because the saying goes that it is better to end well than to begin. The scriptures lend credence to this maxim in averring that \u2018the glory of the latter, shall surpass the former\u2019.\n\nFor the end to be sweet, it must be carefully prepared and very carefully sealed and delivered.\n\nThe bottom line consideration should be hinged on the gentleman zoning plan/agreement between the 3 senatorial districts. That extant agreement vests the turn of Okowa\u2019s successor on the Delta Central Senatorial zone.\n\nIt is therefore only fit and proper that this arrangement/agreement which has oiled the wheels of peace and progress and facilitated the process of gubernatorial transition smoothly and cordially in the state be upheld, at the least by someone like Governor Okowa; whom Governor Ibori stood doggedly by in the face of daunting odds. This milestone transitional midwifing of his successor, would thus only be satisfactory and peaceful, if the Governor\u2019s actions are in keeping with and conform to the rightful expectations of the people of Delta Central Senatorial Zone, who are standing faithfully by to receive the truncheon baton of the state\u2019s governance. As the present leader of the PDP in Delta State, all eyes are definitely focused on Governor Okowa to play the last role on the Delta State political stage with his characteristic elegance, charismatic equanimity, practiced integrity and eclectic dexterity.\n\nThis is the epistle, the image and endnote that Deltans want him to leave with. These qualities summarize and would ultimately memorialize the indelible footprints which he has signposted everywhere and etched deeply into the sands as governor of Delta State in various terrains and landmarks of his very remarkable and distinguished administration.\n\nNo doubt, Governor Okowa is presently widely regarded beyond Delta State as the strongman of Delta politics after Governor James Ibori, the Odidigboigbo himself, who is like the wind that blows in every direction and thus cannot be avoided; and who is irrefutably like the water that has no enemy. Governor Okowa on his part has himself come a long way. He is presently regarded as the road master and grand master of politics beyond Delta State, which is very good. But how the master of politics and the governor of oil rich Delta would handle the politics of who replaces him is presently a mystery that would soon be uncovered.\n\nAccording to statements and utterances made by aides and close confidants of the Governor of Delta State, the Governor is disposed to upholding the rotational arrangement that has brought peace to Delta State, which means the agreement remains sacrosanct. The implication of this position is that Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, the Governor of Delta State will hand over power to someone from Delta central, which is the 1st angle of this political equation.\n\nThe next angle, which is certainly more crucial is the question of who in Delta central from the PDP, is the more qualified, better positioned and well-suited candidate presently jostling for the position among the several contenders that have shown interest in the number one seat? As the late veteran female playwright echoed in her \u2018\u2019Wedlock of the gods\u201d about Uloko by Odibei, \u2018\u2019it\u2019s not anything that parades an okra sprout that is a man\u201d. The issue of the most dependable, most commanding, most imposing, most compelling, most alluring, most accessable and most quintessential candidate is as crucial as imaginable.\n\nThis is why the PDP kingmakers must carefully consider and decide on the caliber of candidate to field in the 2023 gubernatorial election if victory is desired and deserved by the party indeed. The party clearly needs a candidate who when placed with other candidates from the APC on the ballot box balance would tower (not merely physically of course) like Saul in the Bible, head and shoulders above his counterparts. Someone with the charisma and sweeping acceptance that would demystify and swallow any force that any APC candidate can command or wield during the 2023 gubernatorial election. This is the real crux of the issue that the PDP should be dealing with and not divertive external or superficial considerations.\n\nThere is indeed a candidate who commands that level of acceptance, goodwill and trust that is demanded. Let Governor Okowa look at the aspirants from Delta Central very well.\n\nA man like Governor Obaseki of Edo State won the PDP election because he had the massive confidence and support of the masses. Similarly, the victory of PDP in Oyo State during the last gubernatorial poll was ostensibly decided by the caliber of the candidate the party fielded. A candidate who was accepted, loved and trusted by the people and who equally had the necessary influence and supportive means, is who PDP needs to settle for.\n\nI do know very well such a worthy man. A man with very enviable track records of selfless services to the PDP and Delta state equally; with a penchant for open door policy. I will however keep mum on him for Governor Okowa to unveil him.\n\nTherefore, if Gov. Okowa and his team must over-run the APC candidate despite any federal favours or privileges such a candidate may wield, then they must come together this time and unanimously agree on a candidate with the winning pedigree. Anything to the contrary would mean that PDP\u2019s days in Delta state\u2019s governance are numbered.\n\nFurthermore, to do this selection correctly and meritoriously therefore, Gov. Okowa very importantly needs to consult widely. There is a maxim that wisdom resides in the multitude of counsel, which is why it is said that a man who asks the way hardly misses his tracks. Though there is no doubt that the Governor is very versatile politically, it would be wrong to assume that he knows it all; because in politics; clearly there is no man who is an island unto himself and knows it all.\n\nExpectedly therefore and very imperatively, the Governor should bring to a round table former Governors, former Federal Ministers, former Senators, present House of Representative members, former speakers of the House of Assembly who are all descendants and ancestors of the great PDP; inclusive of but not restricted to veterans like Chiefs Ibori, Orubebe, Elumelu, Amori, Osakwe. There is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking counsel; on the contrary, it is a virtue.\n\nDefinitely, the central issue and overriding concern that should be of focus at this time is not the axis in Delta Central that the governor should emerge from in 2023. That would be to reduce the governorship to ethnic groups, basis and biases, which would no doubt pose dangers of ethnic vicissitudes for the party subsequently.\n\nThe legacy that Gov. Okowa and the party leaders should consider leaving behind, which would guarantee the victory and progress of the PDP and Deltans; can only derive from searching and installing a worthy, people \u2013 oriented candidate, who would have a walk- over at the primaries and win the APC candidate hands down and without stress.\n\nIf however the number one candidate of the party in Delta State in the person of Governor Okowa decides to jettison edifying considerations and cling to old sentimental alliances with some power brokers, he is most likely not going be able to identify a winning candidate who will naturally succeed him and continue the legacies of peace and prosperity that the PDP has painsgtakingtly established in Delta State. This would inevitably be very regrettable.\n\nThis therefore is time to learn from history. This period of skepticism calls for strong consultations and divine instruction. To do otherwise would be counterproductive.\n\nThus, the onus is on Gov. Okowa to make things better for him and Delta State politically by supporting a popular aspirant from Delta Central Senatorial zone, so that when he rounds off his second tenure, he would be greatly remembered for supporting his successor and bequeathing to the next generation of leaders a lasting legacy.\n\nEdomi, is the Publisher/Editor-in-Chief, South-South International, Member, Editorial Board of SANs Compendium & Former Publicity Secretary of Association of Communication Scholars & Professionals of Nigeria.",

          "title": "The parables of Christ, explained II",
          "text": "By Simon Ifeanyi Ezeh\n\nIn the first article on the parables of Christ, we\u2019d stated that it\u2019s impossible to understand the dynamics of God\u2019s kingdom without understanding the parables used by Christ to explain the kingdom of God.\n\nThe parables essentially expose the true nature of God\u2019s kingdom behavior or character to humanity and completely demystify all the concepts hitherto classified as mysteries by people like Paul, Job and David.\n\nConcepts like salvation, judgment or final judgment, sin, good and evil, righteousness, perfection, brothers of Christ, heaven and hell, prayer, repentance, etc. were all explained by Christ in those parables and their real meanings are usually the opposites of what we have been told by other people.\n\nWe are just going to continue on the parables of Christ by listing the ones that weren\u2019t considered in the previous article and explaining them to help believers understand the true nature of God\u2019s kingdom and how to conduct their affairs as children of God. Sinners are also hereby invited to repent and begin to obey God in their lives because it\u2019s very possible to do so and many people have been obeying God even before the coming of Christ physically or his incarnation of God\u2019s word as a human being. If you repent from sin, there would be a celebration on your behalf in heaven and God would become your father henceforth. God is not the father of sinners because sinners don\u2019t obey God; they obey the devil (their father) instead.\n\nJoh 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.\n\nJoh 8:35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.\n\nJoh 8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.\n\nJoh 8:37 I know that ye are Abraham\u2019s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.\n\nJoh 8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.\n\nYou Are of Your Father the Devil\n\nJoh 8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham\u2019s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.\n\nJoh 8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.\n\nJoh 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\n\nJoh 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.\n\nJoh 8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.\n\nJoh 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the flesh and blood of Christ? Is it right for Christians to plead the blood of Christ or to use it as a weapon for fighting their enemies? The answers are in this elaborate parable below.\n\nJoh 6:26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.\n\nJoh 6:27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.\n\nJoh 6:28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?\n\nJoh 6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\n\nJoh 6:30 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?\n\nJoh 6:31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.\n\nJoh 6:32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.\n\nJoh 6:33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.\n\nJoh 6:34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.\n\nJoh 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.\n\nJoh 6:36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.\n\nJoh 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\n\nJoh 6:38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.\n\nJoh 6:39 And this is the Father\u2019s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\n\nJoh 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJoh 6:41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.\n\nJoh 6:42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\n\nJoh 6:43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.\n\nJoh 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJoh 6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.\n\nJoh 6:46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.\n\nJoh 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\n\nJoh 6:48 I am that bread of life.\n\nJoh 6:49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.\n\nJoh 6:50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.\n\nJoh 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\n\nJoh 6:52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\n\nJoh 6:53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\n\nJoh 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJoh 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\n\nJoh 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.\n\nJoh 6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.\n\nJoh 6:58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live forever.\n\nJoh 6:59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.\n\nThe Words of Eternal Life\n\nJoh 6:60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?\n\nJoh 6:61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?\n\nJoh 6:62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?\n\nJoh 6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\n\nJoh 6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.\n\nJoh 6:65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.\n\nJoh 6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.\n\nJoh 6:67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?\n\nJoh 6:68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.\n\nJoh 6:69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.\n\nJoh 6:70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\n\nJoh 6:71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.\n\nThe sum of the above teaching is that Christ, as an allegorist, used physical and visible symbols to teach the Jews the abstract concept of believing, internalizing or imbibing his words and living according to those words in order to possess the life of God (eternal life). According to him, whatever we eat couldn\u2019t save us or offer us eternal life which begins with the knowledge of God, we only live (eternal life) by \u201ceating\u201d Jesus Christ (God\u2019s word). When we eat physical food, it gets digested and becomes flesh, blood, bones, hair, nails, etc. in our body but it doesn\u2019t determine what we think, say or do. Our thoughts, words and actions originate from our minds and are decided by us based on what we know and believe in.\n\nWhatever we think, say or do are products of whatever we\u2019ve heard, known and believed in. So, if we receive the words of Christ, imbibe same and live according to those words until the end of our lives, we shall be saved but if we don\u2019t live according to the words of Christ, we shall be damned. The only healthy food for our souls is the word of God (the words of Christ), everything else will kill us, no matter what it is. Note that this \u201cfood\u201d could be actual food we eat or any other thing we take in, tangible or intangible, like music, lectures, the things we see or watch, etc.\n\nThe blood of Christ (according to Christ) is not the blood cells in his veins, neither is his flesh his physical body. His words represent both his flesh and his blood and we eat them by internalizing and practicing them. When a man begins to say that he covers himself or car or business etc. with the blood of Christ, it becomes clear he never knows what the blood of Christ is. The same applies to those who fight their enemies (instead of praying for them as Christ commanded) with the blood of Christ. God says that his people perish for lack of knowledge in spite of being his people. Ignorance is as deadly as sin. Please, let\u2019s know the truth and be set free by it. The truth is Christ, the son of God.\n\nThere\u2019s a tare among the wheat of the words of Christ in Matt 26:27-28 where Christ was supposed to have referred to some wine in a cup as his blood and to a piece of unleavened bread as his flesh thus negating his earlier teachings on the subject matter as well as the cost of eternal life. Christ is not known for double speak, he could never have meant that his blood is wine in a cup or that his flesh is a piece of unleavened bread.\n\nMat 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;\n\nMat 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\n\nMat 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\n\nThe problem with this passage is that he had already told us what his flesh and blood is and the basic character of God which he came to reveal to us is mercy. Why, then, should the same merciful God require the shedding of Christ\u2019s blood to forgive? \u201cBlessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,\u201d should have read \u201cBlessed are those who believe in the sacrifice or blood of Christ, for they shall obtain mercy\u201d but it doesn\u2019t, thankfully. Christ was killed because he came to shine the light in the darkness of this world and those who benefit from darkness won\u2019t take it.\n\nJoh 7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.\n\nThese (below) are some of the scriptures that make the possibility of Christ being a sacrifice to God unthinkable. God ONLY requires repentance from us; no ritual sacrifice has anything to do with God. We are capable of repentance or a change of heart and he\u2019s always ready and willing to forgive whenever he sees repentance. So, what\u2019s the place of sacrifice?\n\nMat 9:12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.\n\nMat 9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n\nPsa 40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.\n\nPsa 40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,\n\nPsa 40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.\n\nPsa 40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.\n\nPsa 40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.\n\nHos 6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.\n\nPsa 50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.\n\nPsa 50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.\n\nPsa 50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.\n\nPsa 50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.\n\nPsa 50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?\n\nIsa 1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.\n\nIsa 1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?\n\nIsa 1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.\n\nIsa 1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.\n\nIsa 1:15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.\n\nIsa 1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;\n\nIsa 1:17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.\n\nIsa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\n\nIsa 1:19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:\n\nIsa 1:20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.\n\nThe parable of the prodigal son is a classic in revealing the mercy principle because as soon as the prodigal son repented, he was forgiven without any requirement for blood sacrifice or any sacrifice at all. This repentance for sinners and mercy from the merciful God construct is all over the sermons of Christ but the apocryphal shedding of blood for remission of sins construct is only mentioned once, without a single witness found elsewhere in the synoptic gospels.\n\nThe Parable of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl of Great Value\n\nMat 13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n\nMat 13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n\nMat 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\nThis parable is very straight forward. It means we\u2019re to give up the whole world as a trade off in order to afford the kingdom of God. Anything that threatens our relationship with our father should be given up or completely relegated. It might be our need for appreciation or approval by others, material possession, pride, our need for comfort, company of our relatives and friends, ambition and life goals, quest for excellence, love of money, power and fame, etc. Unfortunately, Christians don\u2019t give up the world in order to afford the kingdom of God. What we do, instead, is to try to use our faith in God to acquire the things of this life and keep them. The result is that we see abominable things that money could buy like houses, cars, university degrees, lands, overseas travel, political power, etc. as blessings from God and give testimonies when we acquire them.\n\nThe wise child of God would give up all other things in order to consolidate his grip on God\u2019s kingdom but the foolish ones would acquire material things and fight hard to keep them, thus declaring their lack of interest in God\u2019s kingdom. This agrees with Christ\u2019s instruction to the rich young man and all of us to sell everything we have and give to the poor (brothers of Christ are the poor) in order to qualify as Christ\u2019s disciples.\n\nThe tragedy of contemporary Christianity is that those of us who have don\u2019t give it up and those of us who don\u2019t have are unhappy because we don\u2019t have, thus proving that Christians are unaware of who they are and would not go to heaven unless they repent.\n\nHow many of us know that whatever the world considers very relevant or highly valued is sinful to God? Perhaps, we think of the important things in this life and understand that they are abominable to God so we change our attitude towards such things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s stupidity to be proud. Whatever a man is proud of in this life is sinful to God. Therefore, a proud person is also a blind person or a fool. This understanding would change us completely because we won\u2019t participate in celebrating abominations in this life, let alone calling for such celebrations ourselves.\n\nLuk 16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.\n\n+234(0)708-187-1082 [email protected]\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Musa Lana, the Bishop urged them to count him out of such allegations.\n\nYohanna, who could not fathom why the \u201cacclaimed clergies\u201d have continued to drag the hard earned image of the church to the mud, said \u201d I am surprised that these types of allegations are coming from people who claimed to be ministers of God.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed claims that he was using police saying, they \u201care people who are put in the society to secure others.\u201d\n\nYohanna, who went ahead to narrate how he has been working tirelessly to ensure a round table dialogue between both parties, said \u201cI have not instigated any police person and I am not using any police against any person.\u201d\n\nStressing that \u201cwe are clerics who are supposed to work by order \u201d he felt dejected that the reverse has turned out to be the case stating that \u201d if you hear the stories behind some of these things that people are saying, you will be very surprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor people to go about saying we are using the security to harass and intimidate them,\u201d he said \u201cit is a lie\u201d adding that \u201cthe security are here to ensure that things are done orderly \u201c.\n\nThe bishop who also spoke extensively on the calls made by the aggrieved clerics to the West Africa College of Bishops on the need for them to compel Yohanna to account for the aforementioned funds, also exonerated himself from the alleged misappropriation of the fund.\n\nThe bishop, who said he has never been financially found wanting by the leadership of the church at both international and national levels said \u201csince I became a bishop, I am always audited\u201d stating that \u201cthere is no year in and year out that auditors don\u2019t come around. \u201d\n\nAuditors from both abroad and internally, he said, always come around to audit the church.\n\nThrowing his weight behind the bishop, the Administrative Assistant to the Bishop, Rev. Yoti Filiya, told our correspondent that the bishop has never, for once, taken any member of the church to the police station.\n\nThe only case the church has ever known, according to him \u201cwas between the Taraba State Police Command and some pastors and laitys of UMCN \u201d who as stated by him were being \u201cprosecuted for spying on the sensitivity property of the State Police Command and sending picture to foreign partners abroad, which the police according to him \u201csaid contravenes the Official Secret Act\u201d.\n\nRather than going about soiling the image of the church, he aligned his weight to that of the bishop to beckoned at aggrieved to accept the olive branches that the bishop has been extending to them.",

          "text": "The Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, Mr. Osita Okechukwu has urged the people of Enugu State to embrace the Federal Government\u2019s ongoing Integrated Farm Estate Project.\n\nThe Federal Government had announced recently that it would establish Integrated Farm Estates across the 109 Senatorial districts of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the Government\u2019s plan has been faced with mixed feelings, as some feel it was an indirect way of reintroducing the controversial RUGA project.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Sunday in Enugu, Mr. Okechukwu appealed to Enugu communities to participate fully in the project. As the farm projects will be managed by the communities themselves not Fulanis, it is community based.\n\nHe said that the FG\u2019s programme, meant for the 109 Senatorial districts, was a presidential mandate to close bandits\u2019 market, provide employment and food security.\n\nMr Okechukwu explained that he was making the passionate appeal \u201cbecause our people are embarrassingly missing billions of Naira budget from the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), unlike other geopolitical zones, in one of the key projects in the Buhari\u2019s Agrarian Revolution value chain.\u201d\n\nHe said he was subscribing to back to land project, stressing that, \u201cit is community based, and aimed at generating mass employment, as creation of employment is the best way to close banditry, kidnappings and terrorism in our land. For an idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop.\u201d\n\nEBUBEAGU: VON DG, Okechukwu hails Southeast Governors\n\nOkechukwu said that it was regrettable that some people\u2019s preoccupation had become stock-pilling hatred against the central government as if President Buhari was going to preside over Nigeria for life.\n\n\u201cWe should not gloss over the truism that the central government remains the only common shelter, which shelters us all. In no distant future Nigeria will take her destined status as giant of Africa. Therefore, it is not pragmatic to cut our nose to spite Buhari\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we should not reject humanitarian projects which ignite employment, close bandits\u2019 markets, reduce poverty and provide food security, because of sentiments,\u201d he advised.\n\nOkechukwu further said that he was happy that the Executive Secretary of National Land Development Authority (NALDA), Prince Paul Ikonne, had clarified the concept of the programme thus:\n\n\u201cThe true position is that the integrated farm estate is designed to accommodate the youths from that community in order to engage them in the entire agricultural value chain.\n\n\u201cAnd it depends on what the community is interested in going into, some states are getting into poultry like in the north, in the south like Abia they\u2019re doing fishery and rabbit rearing. In Oyo we already have rabbit rearing and crop farming; in Ekiti crop farming. \u2026..it is not another or anything that has to do with Rural Grazing Area (RUGA); what we have is poultry, fishery, piggery and any farming model of the choice of the community,\u201d he quoted Ikonne as saying.\n\n2023: Why Tinubu did not become Buhari\u2019s vice-president \u2013 VON Director-General, Okechukwu",

          "text": "By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has seized over 24, 311 kilograms of heroin and codeine as well as the Arizona and Colorado variants of cannabis in fresh drug busts at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, (MMIA), Ikeja and the Tincan Seaport, Apapa, Lagos state.\n\nSpokesperson of the agency, Femi Babafemi, in a statement on Sunday, said the first seizure was on Friday 3rd September, 2021 at the SAHCO export shed of the MMIA where two consignments containing 10.350kg heroin and 25.2kg cannabis from South Africa were intercepted.\n\nHe added that in a series of sting operations between Saturday 4th September and Monday 6th September in different parts of Lagos, four suspects were arrested including Mrs. Bello Kafayat Ayo, who was picked up at Shylon Street, Palmgroove area of the State.\n\nBabafemi said at the Tincan Seaport, Apapa, narcotic officers intercepted a 40-foot container loaded with 22,590 kilograms of Barcadin Codeine syrup on Monday following intelligence received from international partners on the container since May 2021.\n\nHe said the container also contained 4,020.03kg of analgesic tablets and 47 cartons of insulated hot pots used to conceal the illicit drugs, all imported from India.\n\nAccording to the statement, on Friday 10th September, a consignment of Colorado weighing 17.5kg and hidden inside a Grand Caravan Dodge vehicle shipped in a 40ft container from Montreal, Canada, was also intercepted and seized at the Tincan port.\n\nThe statement also revealed that a 20-year-old graduate, Miss Bee Okoro, was arrested in Abuja for producing and selling drugged candies and cookies.\n\nA 27-year-old dispatch rider, Idewo Raimi who handles door-to-door delivery for her was also arrested.\n\nIt reads: \u201cThe suspects who were arrested at Garki Area 11 on Friday 10th Sept, with a number of their drugged products and 400grams of Loud and Arizona, confessed they have been in the drug business for over a year.\n\n\u201cIn Edo state, a total of 1,425.2 kilograms of compressed blocks of cannabis sativa were seized in a raid on Aviosi outskirt, close to Uzebba, Owan west LGA, on Monday 6th Sept, while on the same day one Yahaya Mamman was nabbed along Zaria-Danja road, Kaduna with 10.3kg Tramadol and 60.5kg Exol-6. The previous day, Thursday 5th Sept, one ThankGod Danladi was arrested at Tudun Wada area of Jalingo, the Taraba state capital with 44.2kg of cannabis.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, NDLEA operatives in Kwara state on Tuesday 7th Sept, arrested a 36-year-old lady, Yusuf Sherifat who recently completed a jail sentence following her conviction by a Federal High Court in Ilorin for dealing in 22 grams of crack cocaine. Her latest arrest along Specialist Hospital Road, Alagbado, Ilorin, followed intelligence that she has resumed sale of crack cocaine in Ilorin metropolis. This time around, she devised another means of delivering drugs along the road to known customers who contact her via telephone calls.\n\n\u201cIn Gombe state, raids across the state between Wednesday 1st Sept and Friday 10th Sept led to the arrest of at least nine drug dealers from who assorted illicit drugs weighing over 150kg were recovered. One of such was the interception of a DAF truck loaded with 128kg of psychotropic substances coming from Onitsha, Anambra state along Gombe-Yola road.\n\n\u201cIn his reaction to the latest drug busts at the Lagos airport, Tincan seaport and across the FCT, Edo, Kaduna, Taraba, Kwara and Gombe states, Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), commended the commanders, officers and men of the commands for their resilience and bravery. He said the series of arrests and seizures across the country further affirm NDLEA\u2019s zero tolerance for production, trafficking and abuse of any illicit substance, warning that drug dealers who are yet to have a change of heart must be ready to contend with the new NDLEA.\u201d",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nBenue State Government has advised Miyetti Allah groups and others who want the state to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law to stop daydreaming, saying the state will on no condition repeal the law.\n\n\u201cThe law has come to stay, and no amount of sponsored propaganda can compel the state government to repeal it.\u201d\n\nThe resolute declaration of the government came in a statement titled, \u2018MACBAN Spokesman and His Many Contradictions\u2019 which was signed by Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase and made available to newsmen yesterday.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cWe listened to the utterances of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), National Secretary, Baba Usman Ngelzarma on Channels Television in which he described as a failure, the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of Benue State.\n\n\u201cNgelzarma\u2019s comments did not come to us as a surprise. He is indeed one of those whose wilful ignorance and misinterpretation of the law have fueled bitter emotions and hatred among pastoralists to embark on a killing spree of farmers in Benue State and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe MACBAN national secretary is not new to contradictory statements. It is on record that he and other officials of the group visited Benue State in 2017 and after a meeting with Governor Samuel Ortom, addressed the media where they pledged support for the state\u2019s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law.\n\n\u201cOn that occasion, Ngelzarma who spoke on behalf of the delegation, admitted that with their deeper knowledge of the law during their visit to Benue, it was now obvious to MACBAN that the legislation was indeed not targeted at Fulani or any other group. Their only appeal was for extension of the November 2017 deadline given for the commencement of implementation and enforcement of the law.\n\n\u201cThat the Miyetti Allah mouthpiece now goes to national television to kick against the same law they once described as \u2018a win-win for all\u2019 only proves that he is a merchant of crisis and one of those bent on truncating the peace building process in Benue and other states of the federation.\u201d\n\nAkase who noted that Miyetti Allah\u2019s anger towards Governor Samuel Ortom is well understood said it was expected that the Ngelzarma and his group would feel frustrated after the governor refused to accept their offer to betray his people and repeal the law in order to attract personal favours from their sponsors.\n\n\u201cMiyetti Allah groups have not hidden their evil agenda. They threaten farming communities and carry out such threats leaving hundreds dead, yet, they have the audacity to go to television studios and heap insults on victims of their carnage.\n\n\u201cThe question Ngelzarma and others who blame herdsmen\u2019s attacks and killings in Benue on the law fail to answer is: what is responsible for similar killings in states which have no laws on open grazing such as Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Plateau,\u201d the statement queried.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nThe National Secretary, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Saleh Alhassan, an engineer, has said that the Anti-Open Grazing Law in the southern part of the country is a bargaining chip by the zone to secure favourable political negotiations ahead of 2023 elections.\n\nSaleh who posited that the law is not implementable disclosed that the association has already swung into action in a bid to protect their members and their businesses in the zone.\n\nHe spoke further in this interview.\n\nWhat is Miyetti Allah doing now to ensure your members do not run foul of the Anti-Open Grazing Law, which is spreading in the southern part of the country?\n\nWe are taking a number of actions as regards this development. Number one, we are taking legal action against the states both at local court and international court. We are equally applying political and spiritual solutions. We are already lobbying the National Assembly and the executive arm of the government to stop the governors. The National Assembly should perform its constitutional responsibility of protecting every citizen of this country, including the herdsmen and their business of herding. We are equally lobbying the executive arm of government to do the needful by creating options for the herders through budgetary allocations, creation of ministry for livestock and fishery. The National Assembly should pass the bill that has been there, lying fallow; these are the political options we are taking. And then, we are sending a very strong negotiating team to some of these governors because they may have been ill-informed about the security situations in their states. Let them look at the realities. There is no any space that cannot be governed in this country with GPR technology. We are equally exploring spiritual option that is why Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho are in jail while those sponsoring them are there in the hospital.\n\nOn what basis are you planning to challenge the action of the southern governors who have decided to save the economy and lives of the people in their respective states from criminal elements terrorizing their states?\n\nWe are going to challenge them on the basis of the violation of the fundamental human rights of our members as free citizens of this country- that is freedom of movement. We have this fundamental right protected by the constitution; by the African Charter of Human Rights to move freely and do our business freely as law-abiding citizens of this country. If movement is the same thing as inter-state commerce, you cannot legislate against inter-state commerce at the level of state Assembly; it is the jurisdiction of the National Assembly. You cannot deny us our freedom of movement and means of livelihood because that is protected by the constitution and the African Charter of Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n\nThis law came as a response to the effect of the activities of herders on the lives and the means of livelihood of the people of the South. How do you intend to react to this?\n\nIt is not true. Is there any case in the law court against the herders in those states? We have laws against trespass, how many of the cases are in the law court in this regard? How many cases have been declared against the herdsmen? It is mere propaganda. All these cases are cases of trespass. Where have they been accused of violating the law of trespass? There are existing laws against trespass. It is just propaganda to destroy our business. It is a policy that is meant to destroy our means of livelihood.\n\nWhy do you think the southerners are now moving against the Fulani herders whom they had lived together with for years if the allegation against them is mere propaganda as you posited?\n\nThe southerners are just playing bad politics because the president is a Fulani man. Their plan is to put pressure on his (President) people, which is wrong. The truth of the matter is that most of the cows in the South actually belong to merchants from Southern Nigeria. If you go to the bush there is nobody farming in the forest. The reality is that it is all propaganda. They are just hiding under this Anti-open Grazing Law probably because they want to score political point. Secondly, they may want to use it to steal security votes, loot the treasuries of the state. Thirdly, they want to deceive the people of their states \u2013 the masses in order not to be accountable to them.\n\nYou seem to suggest that the move is targeted at the president. If you would recall, the South voted overwhelmingly for the President, why do you now think they want to turn against the president?\n\nThat is probably because they are not getting favourable signals from their negotiation with him for 2023. So, they think by the time they mount pressure on his people, the herders, they will be able to get political commitments, which is wrong. They should go and discuss with their political peers and leave the herders to do their business.\n\nIf the cows in the South actually belong to southern merchants as you claim, don\u2019t you think the fight over the Anti-open Grazing Law should be between the southern merchants who own the cows and the governors in the region, not Miyetti Allah and the state governors in the South?\n\nThe law is not targeted at the southern merchants, but the herders. What they should do is to close the cattle market there if they don\u2019t want cattle business in the South. But if they make law against our people in the forest, that is what we will reject. Let them shut down all the abattoirs in the South. There is nothing they aim to achieve than to frustrate the Fulani. So, if they can shut down the abattoirs in the South then we will know that they are serious that they don\u2019t want cow in the South. Is there any grazing field in Rivers State? Is there any grazing field in Lagos and Bayelsa states? You must understand the ecology of these areas. If you see cow in any of these states, it is meant for abattoir. Yes, there are grazing areas in northern part of Ondo and part of Oyo; these are just few places we can say we have grazing areas. When they ganged up to make anti-grazing law we knew they were just playing politics. We are waiting to see how they will implement the anti-open grazing law. It is a satanic law; it\u2019s an empty law because it is not implementable. It is a law made without creating an option. They made law against grazing in their states, where are they going to graze their cows? If you are making a law you must make sure it is a law that can work; a law that promotes peace and ensures harmony in the society.\n\nDo you know what it costs to set up a ranch? You need nothing less than N4 million to ranch 20 cows. If you sell the entire 20 cows you can\u2019t make N4 million. The government should create the ranches then rent them out to us. But you don\u2019t create the ranches and you want to drive us, you cannot expect us to keep quiet. It is not possible. Do you think we will carry our cattle on our heads and leave the region? That is not possible. It\u2019s an empty law. Create places and tell us this is where we designate for you and state your conditions; tell us what we will pay as tax or fee then we take our cows and settle there. The governors are pretending as if they don\u2019t know what to. The truth is that they know they are just playing politics with it.\n\nNow that you have kicked against the Anti-open Grazing Law, how do you think the problem of herders going about with AK47, which they use for their nefarious activities, can be addressed?\n\nThe pictures of herders carrying AK47 on Internet are pictures from East Africa, they are pictures of the Masai. If you see anybody carrying AK 47 and the person is not following cows; he is a bandit and it is not our responsibility to identify bandits, it is the responsibility of the government. Go and see bandits who are terrorizing everybody in the bush. Their first victims are the herders because they rustle their cattle. A criminal is a criminal whether he is a Fulani man or a Yoruba man. So, why are you attaching his ethnicity to his infamous action? Do you attach the ethnic identities of the Southerners who are into Internet fraud to them when they are caught? Have you ever heard people say \u2018Yoruba ritualist? There is an agency against prostitution and human trafficking; do you attach the identity of Edo people who constitute 80 per cent offenders to these crimes? No, you don\u2019t that. There are criminals everywhere and in every community, so stop attaching ethnicity to crimes.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "2023: Crab mentality may deny Ndigbo presidency \u2013 Sylvan Ebigwei",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nElder statesman, renowned dental surgeon, former Chairman of the Governing Board, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, President-General emeritus, Aka-Ikenga, an Ndigbo intellectual think tank and former Vice President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide, Dr Sylvan Ebigwei, in this interview with Sunday Sun, x-rayed the critical issues destroying the country, stating also what needs to be done, including the clamour for president of Igbo extraction in 2023, PIB and the recent attack on Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA). Excerpt:\n\nWhat is your take on the attack of the Nigerian Defence Academy?\n\nIt is threatening and highly provocative and it demeans the Nigerian military. A whole Academy, for the so-called bandits to attack there has left many questions than answers. Of course, no bandit(s) will have the guts to break into a military academy especially the NDA in Kaduna; they killed men and kidnapped an officer. It is unheard of. In any clime the military barracks, the military academies are the most secured environment that you can think of in any country, not to talk of Nigeria. I trained at Southern Police College, Ikeja, it was known as the Southern Police College in the 60s, I trained there. Even for you as a student there to gain access into that arena; you have to pass through some security checks. What happened at the NDA in Kaduna to me is a betrayal, a conspiracy. You cannot pass a fortified gate of the academy to go and operate with arms for that matter. I see it as a betrayal of the officers there by those they know very well or those who know that environment. It\u2019s not an ordinary invasion, there is more to it. The situation does not urgur well for the security of this nation. If they have done that to break into a military Academy, it means they can equally break into the Aso Villa to kidnap Mr. President or any other person. So who is safe? As far as I am concerned the authorities especially the Presidency should not sweep this under the carpet. They should not call it an invasion by bandits, bandits rob on the highways, and bandits do not go into the military Academy because there is no money there for them to steal. It is an inside job to shame the Buhari government. It\u2019s to let the government know that there is no strong security in the country. To attack where you train your security officers portends danger and the message is that any place can be attacked. If they can break into the Academy they can equally break into the house of the Senate President, the Speaker of the House, not to talk of the governors. They should probe the incident very well. DSS and all the security agencies must dig into the issue and uproot it.\n\nAlthough the PIB has been passed it has continued to generate intense controversy as the Niger Delta region is still, kicking over the three per cent allocation?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, whether it is one per cent, three per cent, 50 per cent or more, Nigerians, sorry to say it, are endemically and pathologically fraudulent when managing certain things. My worry is that the ones that have been given to the region what have they done with it over the years? That is the issue. They have been pumping money into the NDDC over the years what can we show with it? I am from Delta State, what do we have to show for it? Instead, individuals become richer than the corporations and even than the government. I am not concerned with any form of percentage because no matter the percentage you allocate it will just be a drain pipe and this is sad. Until our brothers and by extension the Nigerian people change their mindset, we will continue to walk in circles with nothing genuine to show for it. I am aware that the NDDC report, the financial investigations carried out is out now, let us see what is in the report before we continue killing ourselves on PIB three per cent. What is sad, what I have noticed, and what everybody has seen is that the people who lay the golden goose, the Niger Deltans, are poorer than any other part of Nigeria. The government should up their ante in addressing issues concerning that region and not releasing money to those who will still embezzle that same money. If the government means well for the region they should change tactics and do something that will benefit the region and its people directly. They should not go through third parties. Look at the Abuja-Kaduna railway stations; look at the Airports being built in some states using the oil money, built directly by the Federal Government, look at the universities and institutions handled directly by the Federal Government here and there. Look at the hospitals being built by the Federal Government directly\u2014why can\u2019t they do the same for the Niger Delta region? You bring out money for agriculture, how has the Niger Delta region benefitted from it? Most people in the rural area of Niger Delta, are farmers and fishermen, now you have deprived them of their environment, you have destroyed their natural habitat, they are no more fishing because of the damage from oil exploration. Government should be committed to ensuring that something is done directly, not through the NDDC, so as to let the people there have a feel of their resources, improve their quality of life among others. NDDC is just a nomenclature and to me, it\u2019s a conduit pipe of waste and fraud. They (government) are bringing out Tradermoni, why not bring out oil area money, give directly to the people, empower them with it, set up areas where they can do their businesses, set up industries there, empower their youths etc. You stay in Abuja and say you have allocated billions of money and at the end of the day 90 per cent of the money will end in individual pockets and nobody is brought to book. That is not the way to go.\n\nAre you worried about the realization of president of Igbo extraction in 2023 given the fact that critics say Ndigbo are not yet serious and worse still not united to form a common front?\n\nPeople saying such cannot be far from the truth. I am the immediate past Vice President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide. I worked with Nnia Nwodo. During our tenure, we tried to set up lot of things, then the election was conducted, after that election, we handed over to Prof George Obiozor, but other people emerged and went to form a parallel organisation. Even before that election, some Igbo people went to Abuja to register Ohanaeze in their name. Even when we were still there some officials of Ohanaeze battled with us so there is this crab mentality among our people. That mentality is that, if I am not there you cannot be there too. Ndigbo must do away with this endemic syndrome of crab mentality, we will find it very difficult politically. Look at a situation whereby the whole of Southern governors met to talk about open grazing and all that matter. How many of the governors from the Southeast are serious about stopping open grazing? This crab mentality syndrome is seriously and negatively affecting the Southeast politics and we have to watch it before it destroys the 2023 agenda because even as I speak some are already sabotaging the effort. If we don\u2019t guide against it there is no way an Igbo man will get it. Of course, nobody gets power ala carte. You have to build bridges across other groups. The question is, are we doing enough of that?\n\nBut the Southeast zone seems to be relying on equity and fair play\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) Nobody gives anybody power on a platter without you working for it and in such work, you must be united. Everybody is complaining about the Fulani, what did they do? They got united, speak with one voice and they control the country today. They know how to manipulate people, they know the art, they massage your ego and take over leadership. Leadership does not mean you have or must have a PhD, but what strategy are you adopting? What is your followership?You are talking about Igboland today, are they united? It is because of that leadership vacuum that Nnamdi Kanu has exploited and emerged. And once he gives order, it is carried out. A mark of leadership is in commanding obedience from the people. If Nnamdi Kanu can apply some sort of diplomacy into what IPOB is doing they will take over everywhere not by force or arms. It is not all about war, but you need to apply a high diplomatic approach to Nigerian issues. Look at the Southwest, no matter how they battle a time will come when they congregate like bees and close their nest and resolve any issue.\n\nHow do you see this lockdown on Mondays in the Southeast?\n\nIt is very undiplomatic, it is not good for Igbo business, it is very negative for the interest of Ndigbo. But the Federal Government needs to listen to complaints of the Southeast and address them.\n\nHow will you assess Buhari\u2019s presidency?\n\nWell, to some people Buhari presidency is the best thing that has happened to Nigeria. Some people are saying that even among the Igbo leaders that they wish there will be another Buhari to continue with the legacies he will leave behind. Some say Buhari\u2019s presidency has impacted negatively on the nation or even a disaster. Whether a leader is good or bad he must have followership, but how does it impact the generality of the people. There are some areas the Buhari administration has done well because it is wrong to condemn everything he has done. There are many areas he has not done well too. What I don\u2019t like as a person is in trying to introduce a feudalistic system into this modern age. There is no country that does open grazing system given environmental changes. Open grazing damages the environment and it has brought a lot of conflicts, herders/farmers clashes, and all that. You ask yourself, how is it done in other countries? Do they still engage in open grazing? No, the cattle business is a private business not government business, so trying to support the herders that are causing mayhem in the country, killing everywhere is not good for the image of his government. Here the government of Buhari scores zero. Also on the issue of appointment there is lopsidedness and against certain minorities and ethnic groups. This is not fair. The positive issues of the Buhari administration include placing infrastructure, developing agriculture and allowing certain businesses to thrive such as the airlines, raising revenue generation, collectibles. As I said earlier there must be balancing in the areas of appointment, Nigeria has more than 344 ethnic groups and anything you are doing in terms of appointment, amenities must reflect all groups. The issue of security failure is a critical issue, more especially in the president\u2019s own state, Katsina, other places like Zamfara, Kaduna and every other state is under serious threat. Internal security should be arranged by every state of this country. Centralizing security in Abuja is not the best option. The governors are the chief security officers of their states; they should be given some power to make state security arrangements so that they can protect their people.\n\nWhat do you think is the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems?\n\nAs a doctor before you cure a patient you must know what the person is suffering from. You need a correct diagnosis. Politics has destroyed Nigeria, just as religion has equally done so. Politics is good, democracy is good, but the system of democracy in Nigeria is very primitive because politicians see politics as a source of income/livelihood, not as service to the people. What we must do now is to convoke a national political conference. I know that we have had some reviews, but certain things need to be pin-pointed out. The pecks of political office holders are too high, it\u2019s unsustainable in a country like Nigeria. If we are adopting the Presidential system as we are doing now, make political office holding a part-time affair, Senator, lawmakers be paid allowances when they meet. Governors when you retire, no pension for you, etc. Make political office less attractive. If you want to serve why must you go to the bank to borrow to win an election? Devolve some powers to the federating units (restructuring). Let there be state police with well-articulated rules and regulations guiding it. The Parliamentary system of government, if you ask me, is best for Nigeria.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

So, we are still gathering the information on the number of states that have complied with that. While in some of the states, the Bill is at the stage of passage by the State House of Assembly but not yet signed into law, a state like Ekiti has signed the bill into law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JUSUN scribe said that at the moment, the union is waiting to get the report of the NJC\u2019s monitoring committee before it can decide on the next line of action.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the NJC has written letters to all the state Chief Judges (CJs) and copied the state chairmen of JUSUN. The content of the letter is that they should furnish the NJC with information on the progress being made by the respective states on the implementation of the financial autonomy agreement,\u201d he added\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Fayemi and his deputy, Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal had put their pen on paper on behalf of the 36 state governors on the historic agreement reached on May 20, to bring to an end a two-month industrial action embarked upon by JUSUN and PASAN.\n\nThe agreement, which was prepared on May 20 but signed on June 5, stipulates that all the states shall enact laws for the implementation of the financial autonomy of their judiciaries and legislatures, within 45 days of the signing of the agreement.\n\nThe 45 days expired on July 20, exactly 54 days ago.\n\nBefore the judicial workers embarked on the strike, President Muhammadu Buhari had issued Executive Order 10 for the implementation of this autonomy as enshrined in the Constitutions but the states defied the order.\n\nHowever, Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, and Plateau states claimed they had started the implementation of the financial autonomy.\n\nBayelsa State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Ayabaina Duba, told THISDAY at the weekend that the implementation of the financial autonomy started during the administration of the late Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha.\n\nChairman of the Plateau State House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Peter Dasun told THISDAY at the weekend that the law had been enacted, while implementation had also commenced.\n\nBut the state Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Philip Longji told THISDAY that: \u201cFull implementation has not begun. What we have now is partial implementation.\u201d\n\nIn Ekiti State, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye told THISDAY that Governor Fayemi had signed the Judicial and the Legislative Funds Management bills into laws to prepare propitious grounds for financial autonomy for the two arms.\n\nGovernor Okowa of Delta State has also signed into law the financial autonomy bills for the state legislature and the judiciary.\n\nIn Cross River State, the House of Assembly passed the Judiciary Funds Management Bill 2021, and the Legislature Funds Management Bill 2021 in the first week of July, while Governor Ayade signed the bills last week.\n\nIn Niger State, the lawmakers have passed the State Assembly Service Commission Bill, the Judiciary Fund Management Bill, and the Assembly Fund Management Bill but Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has not given his assent.\n\nThe Clerk of the House of Assembly, Alhaji Abdullahi Kagara confirmed the passage of the bills to THISDAY.\n\nIn Kebbi State, the Chairman of JUSUN, Comrade Umar Bawa told THISDAY that the state governor, Mr. Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has not signed the bill passed by the state lawmakers.\n\nThe Oyo State House of Assembly has also passed the Oyo State Judiciary and Oyo State House of Assembly Funds Management Bills, 2021, on July 15 but Governor Seyi Makinde has not signed the bills.\n\nThe Clerk of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Mr. Pius Udoh also told THISDAY at the weekend that the lawmakers have signed the bill, and are awaiting the assent of the state Governor Willie Obiano.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, the Kwara State branch Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Ibrahim Sambo told THISDAY that the bill was still before the state House of Assembly.\n\nThe Chairman of Enugu State House of Assembly\u2019s Committee on Information, Hon. Jeff Mba told THISDAY at the weekend that the lawmakers had prepared the necessary legislation and were awaiting the state government to set up the necessary commission for implementation.\n\nEbonyi State chapter of JUSUN and PASAN told THISDAY that the state government had started the process of setting up the State Accounts Allocation Committees (SAAC).\n\nThe State Chairman of JUSUN, Oko Nnachi, told THISDAY that the processes that would lead to the formation of the committee had started in the state.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Chairman of PASAN, Mrs. Uche Edene noted that the state had gradually started the implementation of the Financial Autonomy even before the strike started.\n\nShe noted that the state had enacted Fund Management Law in 2016 which gave birth to the State House of Assembly Commission.\n\nThe Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye, told THISDAY through the Special Assistant on Media Affairs, Mr. Kunle Alabi that the Osun State Legislative Funds Management Bill 2021 and Osun State Judicial Funds Management Bill were passed recently and awaiting assent of Governor Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe Chairman of PASAN in Benue State, Mr. Joseph Adole told THISDAY that the state lawmakers had passed the bills but Governor Samuel Ortom has not given his assent.\n\nThe Nasarawa State House of Assembly last week passed the Assembly Financial Management Bill, waiting for Governor Abdullahi Sule\u2019s assent.\n\nChairman of the state House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Mohammed Omadefu, who disclosed this to THISDAY, added that the Judicial Financial Management Bill has scaled through the second reading in the house.\n\nIn Taraba State, the two bills seeking financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature have only passed the first readings in the state House of Assembly.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Akwa Ibom State Legislative Fund Management Bill is still at the committee level and may be committed to a public hearing for further input, while the bill on the judiciary was yet to be sent to the House of Assembly for consideration.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Information and member representing Etinan State Constituency, Mr. Aniefiok Dennis confirmed this to THISDAY weekend.\n\nGovernors Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State were also yet to implement autonomy in their states.\n\nImo State Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Ernest Nnanebu, told THISDAY that the union was getting set for another round of strike.\n\nChairman of the PASAN in Edo State, Comrade Hassan Umaru Faruq told THISDAY that the state lawmakers have not done anything on the bills.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Gen. Christopher Musa, urged the Boko Haram members, who are yet to surrender not to allow other recalcitrant members to deceive them.\n\n\u201cThose that surrendered recently are currently undergoing re-orientation under the Nigerian Army and I am calling on those that are yet to surrender, to follow suit.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to release them into their various communities until they have gone for re-orientation under the Nigerian Army as well as fully screened,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that: \u201cSo far, we released 500 to Borno State Government in July 2021,\u2033 pointing out that before their release, they were given vocational training to be self-reliant.\n\nMusa further explained that some of them are innocent but were forcefully conscripted into the terror group.\n\nSpeaking on the closure of Damboa, Damaturu and Gamboru Ngala roads, he said the roads were being opened.\n\n\u201cWe have started re-opening the roads and the new arrangement now is that everyday; our troops will escort the travellers using the road in order to ensure they reach their various destinations safely.\u201c\n\n\u201cWe have started re-opening the road which was closed for a very long period of time; people should be patient, we have been witnessing return of peace in Maiduguri\u201d, he said.\n\nHe, therefore, called on people of the liberated communities wishing to re-locate to their various communities to seek permission from the state government, adding that the Nigerian Army will provide security for the protection of their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Amao, has charged personnel of the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) to sustain the onslaught against terrorists and insurgents in the North-east.\n\nHe gave the charge while on an operational visit to frontline troops of 105 Composite Group, Maiduguri and 103 Strike Group, Yola.\n\nThe visit, which served as morale booster to personnel of the air component, afforded the air force chief the opportunity to interact with them with a view to addressing some of their immediate operational challenges.\n\nA statement issued by the Nigerian Air Force said on arrival in Maiduguri, Amao was briefed by the Air Component Commander, OPHK, Air Commodore Nnamdi Ananaba, who gave a summary of the major achievements recorded by the air component towards degrading the capabilities of insurgents in Borno State, especially in the last 30 days.\n\nThe CAS, thereafter, commended the troops for their commitment to the current onslaught against insurgents in the North-east, while urging them to sustain and maintain the momentum.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe outcome of our air operations has been very encouraging and positive and we must sustain these efforts to remain on course towards meeting our overall end state of ridding the region of these criminals\u201d\n\nHe went on to charge the troops to remain focused and committed towards their operational objective.\n\n\u201cAbsolute commitment, discipline and dedication is required at this point in time for us to get the job done\u201d, he said.\n\nAmao also expressed optimism that the security threats confronting the country would soon be a thing of the past as the NAF, in synergy with other sister services is working assiduously to flush out all criminal elements so as to enable all Nigerians go about their daily lives and businesses without fear.\n\nHe stated that in view of the centrality of air power in joint operations, the NAF would continue to provide the much-needed air support for the ground forces in all theatres of operation in the country.\n\nWhile at Yola, Amao expressed appreciation to the personnel for their commitment and dedication to duty and charged them to continue to synergise their efforts with other security agencies within their location.\n\nHe told the troops that the entire nation remains grateful for their sacrifice and commitment towards keeping Nigeria safe.\n\nMatawalle Rejects Bandits\u2019 Peace Overtures\n\nMeanwhile, the Zamfara State Governor, Matawalle, has rejected all overtures of peace offered by bandits in the state.\n\nMatawalle insisted that the state government was no longer interested in negotiating with bandits, accusing them of rejecting the Olive Branch offered to them earlier by the government.\n\nThe governor said the barrage of attacks on bandits by security forces had made them to make fresh overtures to government seeking dialogue.\n\nHe said the bandits\u2019 emissaries informed him that they had repented and would want to dialogue with government.\n\nHe said instead, security forces would flush them out of the state.\n\n\u201cMy administration will no longer grant amnesty to bandits as they have failed to embrace the peace initiative earlier extended to them,\u2019\u2019 the governor said, while addressing a congregation in Gusau, the state capital at the weekend.\n\nHe urged residents to be patient and to support new security measures put in place to flush out bandits and their collaborators to restore peace in the state.\n\nHe noted that some of the bandits were running out of Zamfara to other states as a result of the new security measures introduced by the state government.\n\nMatawalle warned politicians against giving any form of support to bandits, stressing that: \u201cpoliticians should fear God and stop buying motorcycles to distribute to people who, in turn, sell to bandits to perpetuate their evil acts.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor said also the state government would prosecute any politician caught in the act.\n\nThe state government had cut off food, petroleum products supply and other essential commodities from the reach of the bandits in their various camps.\n\nThe government had also incepted several vehicles conveying food, drinks and petroleum products to various bandits\u2019 camps in the state.\n\nThe government said earlier that it had also arrested more than 100 violators of Matawalle\u2019s Executive Order to restore law and order in the state.\n\nMatawalle had established the Special Taskforce to enforce measures to address the lingering security challenges of mass kidnapping for ransom and cattle rustling in the state.\n\nOn August 26, the governor signed an Executive Order suspending all weekly markets in Zamfara, banned bicycles and motorcycles from carrying more than one passenger and not more than three passengers in the case of tricycles.\n\nThe state government had also established a Special Taskforce to ensure full compliance with the order while mobile courts were set up to prosecute violators.\n\nMeanwhile, commercial activities in the state have been halted following the two weeks suspension of telecommunication networks in the state by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nAll banking services, mobile telephone services, internet and other related services have also been suspended.\n\nIn a related development, the state Commissioner for Police, Mr. Ayuba Elkanah, announced the suspension of movement of all motorcycles with clutches in 13 local government areas of the state.\n\nIn a chat with newsmen, Elkanah urged members of the public to continue to support security agencies by giving them vital information that would assist in fighting crimes and criminally in the state.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to achieve this aim, additional measures have been put in place \u2013 riding of motorcycles that have clutches have been banned in the 13 local government areas of the state in addition to the earlier enforcement of restrictions on motorcycles and tricycles in Gusau Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cIn Gusau area, Damba and Mada are equally affected in the ban on riding motorcycles with clutches,\u2019\u2019 Elkanah said.\n\nThe police commissioner said they had authoritative information that some unscrupulous elements use the vehicles, especially Golf III cars and Canter trucks, to supply petroleum products and food items to bandits\u2019 camps,\n\nFleeing Bandits Killed by Military in Niger\n\nIn a related development, many bandits, who fled from the ongoing military operation in Zamfara State on several motorcycles were on Friday ambushed and killed in Niger State by men of the Nigerian Armed Forces.\n\nThe exact number of bandits killed could not be immediately ascertained but a source at Maganda village in the Shiroro Local Government Area where the incident happened told THISDAY that \u201cthey were many\u201d.\n\nHe added that one soldier involved in the battle \u201cis still missing\u201d.\n\nSome of the bandits who escaped with serious bullets wounds were being trailed by the soldiers as the entire forest was being combed in search of the escaped ones while the villagers had been engaged to assist in evacuating the remains of the neutralised bandits.\n\nIt was gathered that six sub- machine guns and a number of AK-47 riffles and bags of ammunitions were recovered from the bandits.\n\nAccording to a source at Allawa community, who spoke to THISDAY on the condition of anonymity, most of the bandits neutralised resembled foreigners because: \u201cfrom the dead bodies that we saw, they are not Nigerians; these are foreigners; all of them are carrying long hairs like women\u201d.\n\nOne of the Co- Conveners of the Concerned Shiroro Youth, an organisation monitoring the security situation in the local government area, Alhaji Yussuf Kokki when contacted on phone confirmed the incident, saying \u201cwe heard about it but we don\u2019t have the details\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the District Head of Wawa in Borgu LGA, Dr. Mahmud Aliyu who was abducted by bandits a week ago has regained his freedom.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer of the Niger State Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun confirmed the release of the monarch.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "\u2022Disowns fake circular on social media\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has again dispelled speculations that it was planning to convert the foreign exchange (FX) in domiciliary accounts of bank customers into naira.\n\nThe apex bank has also disowned a fake circulation in social media circles, of a circular with its fake logo curiously dated \u2018September 13, 2021\u2019 and purportedly issued by it to the effect that all domiciliary account holdings are to be converted into naira.\n\nThe bank warned corporate bodies and the public against the use of the CBN\u2019s logo under any guise.\n\nThis is coming as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has commended the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele; the President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, and other recipients of awards at the 2020 Leadership Conference and Awards, held in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nThe clarification on dollar accounts came against the backdrop of false social media reports making the rounds that the apex bank had issued a circular to banks to \u201cconvert domiciliary account holdings into naira\u201d.\n\nHowever, CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, in a statement yesterday insisted that the bank had not \u201ccontemplated, and will never contemplate, any such line of action\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe speculation is a completely false narrative aimed at triggering panic in the foreign exchange market.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the bank had previously assured members of the public that there was no plan whatsoever to convert the foreign exchange in the domiciliary accounts of customers into naira to check purported shortage of availability of the United States dollars.\n\n\u201cOperators of domiciliary accounts and other members of the banking public are therefore advised to completely disregard these fictitious documents and malicious rumours, and go about their legitimate foreign exchange transactions, as we do not doubt that these rumours are only aimed at impugning the integrity of the CBN and activating chaos in the system.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that any circular issued by the apex bank would usually be posted on its website (www.cbn.gov.ng) for the attention of the public.\n\nThe bank further warned corporate bodies and members of the public against the unauthorised use of the CBN logo for any purpose whatsoever, adding that the attention of appropriate authorities had been drawn to this effect while culprits would be sanctioned accordingly.\n\nThe CBN said its attention had been drawn to a \u201cfake circulation, in social media circles, of a circular with a fake CBN logo curiously dated \u201813 September 2021\u2019, and purportedly issued by its Trade and Exchange Department to the effect that all Deposit Money Banks, International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs) and members of the public are to convert domiciliary account holdings into naira\u201d.\n\nThe bank had earlier clarified that it does not intend to convert their dollar accounts into naira.\n\nOn August 2, the apex bank had refuted speculations that it was planning to convert customers\u2019 domiciliary accounts into naira.\n\nThe bank further assured members of the public that it would monitor the commercial banks to ensure they meet the legitimate FX demands of customers.\n\nIt had dismissed insinuations in some quarters that it planned to convert FX in the domiciliary accounts of customers into naira to check the purported shortage of availability of the dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, in his special remarks at The Leadership Awards event chaired by the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, Osinbajo commended the recipients for their respective leadership roles, which he said should serve as inspiration to other Nigerians, irrespective of origin or religion.\n\nWhile paying tribute to the late founder of Leadership Media Group, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah, who he described as a detribalised Nigeria, Osinbajo urged Nigerians to embrace peace and guard against actions capable of disintegrating the country.\n\nEchoing the views of the Vice president, the Sultan of Sokoto enjoined Nigerians to focus more on issues that bind the country together rather than dwell on those that threaten to divide the country.\n\nOn his part, Adesina urged the federal government to consider the economic investment as a way to address the spate of insecurity in the country instead of relying mainly on the military approach.\n\nTop of the list of awardees as joint Leadership Persons of the Year 2020 was the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele; the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina; and the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum.\n\nIn a citation, the organisers said Emefiele was awarded the Leadership Person of the Year 2020 \u201cfor a lifestyle of service that held the economy and the nation together in the face of a monumental global crisis; for his consequential interventions that turn crises into moments of economic opportunity, and for positively redefining the role of the Central Bank\u201d.\n\nThe highpoint of the evening was the presentation of the Person of the Year Award by Osinbajo to Emefiele, who was represented at the event by his Deputy Governor in charge of Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora.\n\nOther recipients on the night were Governors Mai Mala Buni (Yobe) and Godwin Obaseki (Edo), who were awarded Politicians of the Year 2020; and the trio of Governors Ezenwo Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), and Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq (Kwara), who were named Governors of the Year 2020.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reduces entertainment expenses from N8.3bn to N1.3bn\n\n\u2022Spends N14.2bn on travels, transport\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) slashed the various fees collected by directors of the national oil company from N606 million in 2019 to N214 million in 2020, a THISDAY\u2019s analysis of the just-released Audited Financial Statement (AFS) for 2020 has shown.\n\nThis represents a 60.2 per cent reduction in directors\u2019 fees.\n\nTypically, directors\u2019 fees entail compensation for services as a member of the board of directors of the company, excluding reimbursement of expenses or other non-regular forms of compensation.\n\nIn all, the audited statement showed that in certain areas, the corporation did remarkably well in its avowed cost-cutting efforts during the year under review, while other administrative cost centres, gulped a substantial portion of the NNPC\u2019s finances.\n\nFollowing the economic downturn occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which led to the fall in oil prices, the NNPC said it was embarking on the internal restructuring of its operations, including shaving off unnecessary spending as well as automation of its processes.\n\n\u201cThe corporation saved a lot of cost through contract renegotiation by up to 30 per cent on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, introduction of technology that drastically cut travel cost through reduction in in-person meetings and the general automation of processes that enhanced efficiency across the group\u2019s businesses,\u201d Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, said last week.\n\nHe was speaking on how the NNPC made its first gain in 44 years, amounting to N287 billion in 2020.\n\nUnder general administrative expenses, although the NNPC paid N6.2 billion for rent and rates as opposed to N5 billion in 2019, it however reduced repairs and maintenance costs from N38 billion to N26.6 billion.\n\nSecurity expenses were reduced from N12.6 billion in 2019 to N12.3 billion, in 2020, while directors\u2019 fees were reduced from N606 million to N214 million, a slump of about 60 per cent.\n\nThe NNPC board is led by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, who doubles as the alternate chairman, assisted by Senator Magnus Abe, Dr. Tajudeen Umaru, Dr. Steven Dike, Mrs. Lami Ahmed, Chief Pius Akinyelure, Mallam Mohammed Lawal and Secretary of the Board, Mrs. Hadiza Coomassie, as well as the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance.\n\nFor general and administrative charges, the NNPC\u2019s bank charges increased from N370 million in 2019 to N845 million in 2020, exchange loss was N72 million, advertisement and publicity gulped N5.3 billion, up from N1.2 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, employee benefits expenses cost increased from N357 billion to N397 billion, donations rose from N279 million to N3.63 billion, audit fees rose from N1.040 to N1.07 billion, while entertainment expenses were slashed from N8.3 billion to N1.6 billion in the 2020 financial year.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, legal and professional fees paid by the corporation reduced from N30 billion to N24 billion while printing and stationery came down from N1.6 billion to N976 million.\n\nStaff training and recruitment cost slumped from N12.8 billion to N7.5 billion in the year under review and what the corporation termed management and facilitation fees increased from N1.3 billion to N5.6 billion.\n\nHowever, the document revealed that transport and travelling gulped N13.5 billion in 2019 and N14.2 billion in 2020, a year marked by travel restrictions as countries embarked on lockdown due to the pandemic, even as postages and telephone expenses which consumed N8.5 billion in 2019, dropped to N5.6 billion in 2020.\n\nOffice running cost jumped from N11 million to N83 million, while under the subheading other expenses, which included Nigerian content expenses, business development expenses, decoration and beautification expenses, the amount spent was reduced from N53.2 billion to N26.6 billion.\n\nSimilarly, NNPC paid N94 billion as pensions in 2020, up from N90 billion in 2019 and gratuity costs decreased from N51 billion to N46 billion in 2020. Cumulatively, the NNPC spent N678.171 on general and administrative expenses, a reduction from N695.949 in 2019.\n\nThe AFS stated that the share of loss of NNPC in Nikorma Transport and West Africa LPG, the corporation\u2019s shipping and transportation company engaged in transportation of energy products, was not recognised since the accumulated share of loss was higher than the initial investment.\n\nIn terms of monies from contracts, revenue from crude oil sales was N828 billion in 2020 as opposed to N1.0 trillion in 2019; revenue from petroleum product sales was N2.2 trillion in 2020, from a high of N2.9 trillion in 2019, sales of natural gas increased from N489 billion in 2019 to N524 billion in 2020 while monies from services rendered decreased from N144 billion to N89 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\nIn all, group revenues from the above items for the group, decreased from N4.6 trillion in 2019 to N3.7 trillion in 2020, according to the document.\n\nOn a sectorial basis, Nigerian Gas Company (NGC), one of the NNPC\u2019s subsidiaries established in 1988, spent N31.88bn on salaries, welfare and other personnel expenses in 2020 and generated N109.1 billion in 2020, representing a 21 per cent increase from N90.2 billion in 2019.\n\nThe company\u2019s profit before tax also increased by 19 per cent from N54.7 billion in 2019 to N65.1 billion in 2020, while profit after tax also rose by 20 per cent to N52.7 billion from N43.7 billion in the preceding year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BUSTED: Nigeria\u2019s Corrupt Petroleum Corporation Executives Invite Newspaper Editors To Lagos Hotel, To Bribe Them To Discredit Report About Their Incompetence, Wastefulness",
          "text": "The management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has invited newspaper editors to a Lagos hotel with the intention of bribing them to discredit a recent report about ineptitude, mismanagement and corruption in the state oil and gas company.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the planned meeting with the editors is scheduled for 1pm on Sunday at Legend Hotel, close to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja in Lagos.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari.\n\nA source privy to information regarding the emergency meeting told SaharaReporters it is to bribe editors to discredit a report exposing the incompetence of NNPC executives and their wastefulness.\n\n\u201cThey are inviting some editors to Legend Hotel in Lagos to bribe them to discredit a story published by the ICIR on Friday that really embarrassed them. The meeting is scheduled for 1pm on Sunday (today),\u201d the source said.\n\nThe content of the text message sent out to the invited editors reads: \u201cMeeting of selected editors scheduled for Sunday 12/9/2021 @ 1pm. Venue: Legend Hotel adjacent Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Please confirm, attendance.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted data collated from audited financial statements released by the NNPC, led by its Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, on Wednesday. The report exposed how Port Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC), which is managed by Ahmed Dikko, an engineer, reported no income in 2020 but incurred administrative expenses of N19.215 billion, paying salaries, wages and other benefits to unproductive workers to the tune of N22.55 billion.\n\nDespite making zero revenue, Port Harcourt refinery employed 487 new workers and paid N23 billion as salaries in 2020.\n\nSaharaReporters also learnt that the NNPC had already sponsored some groups to criticise the damaging report in an attempt to counter its implications by releasing press statements in the media.\n\nFor instance, a coalition of northern and southern groups recently released a joint statement saying the \u201ccontinuous media attacks were designed to distract NNPC Group Managing Director and Port Harcourt Refinery Managing Director\u201d.\n\nThe group said it took a stand during their second-quarter meeting in Kaduna at the weekend, \u201cbecause the attack dogs of haters of the ongoing reforms at the NNPC are going beyond the boundaries of decency\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs Nigerian citizens, we feel duty-bound to draw public attention to a calculated, coordinated and well-funded media agenda designed to purposely distract the NNPC management, including another committed public servant \u2013 Dikko \u2013 who has been leading the reforms at the level of Port Harcourt refinery,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe report on the 2020 financial statement of the company stated that the 487 new workers are being paid N3.93 billion annually, indicating that each of them takes an average of N8.072 million annually or N672,713 monthly.\n\nThe amount they earn monthly is about the annual salary of a normal Level 8 Federal Government worker.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the refinery employed 1,162 new staff members, paying N41.163 billion in salary and wages, according to The ICIR\u2019s calculations of the company\u2019s wage data on its financial statements.\n\nAlso, out of the 487 staff members employed in 2020, 430 were senior and management staff members, amounting to 88.2 per cent, with huge financial implications. Only 57 were junior staff members.\n\nAlso, out of 675 staff engaged by the refinery in 2019, 656 were management and senior staff, members, representing 97 per cent of the total, with huge financial implications.\n\n\u201cIt is looking like jobs for the boys at our dear refineries. And I wonder, most of these guys are earning heavy wages,\u201d US-based Financial Consultant Ellam Ogochukwu said.\n\n\u201cWhoever is running that enterprise deserves to answer several questions,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, staff pension, gratuity and \u2018long service award\u2019 gulped N77.76 billion in 2020 as against N63.41 billion the previous year.\n\nSurprisingly, under Dikko and his boss Kyari, the PHRC\u2019s unproductive staff were allowed to take car loans, compassionate loans and advances valued at N1.001 billion in 2020.\n\nThe amount was N597.297 million in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, this refinery, which made no revenue, incurred a comprehensive loss of N53.179 billion.\n\nIn the previous year, the company made no revenue but incurred N50.530 billion in comprehensive loss.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, the company comprehensively lost N241.609 billion. Its revenue within this period was merely N6.27 billion.\n\n\u201cThis refinery did not produce oil. What you have is that some people just iron their clothes, go to work and come back at the end of the day without adding to the productivity of the company,\u201d Oil and Gas Analyst at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham Mustapha Wahab told The ICIR.\n\nNNPC Managing Director, Kyari is the chairman of Port Harcourt refinery. He is followed by Ahmed Dikko (MD), Babatunde Sofowora (Executive Director of Services), Reginald Udeh (Executive Director, Finance and Accounts), James Ifeanyichukwu Ajibo (Executive Director, Operations), and Awaisu Muazu (late, served till July 2020).\n\nThese directors took N99.742 million as emoluments in 2020, a 67 per cent increase from N59.650 million they took in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, the Port Harcourt refinery did not record any revenue. Yet, it reported N25.19 billion in expenses.\n\nSix directors collected N59.65 million in fees, meaning that each of them received an average payment of N9.94 million a month in 2019.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, names of the six directors in 2019 were: Group Managing Director of NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari; Managing Director, Abba Bukar (who retired in March 2020); Executive Director of Services, Babatunde S. Sofowore; Executive Director of Operations, Ganiyu Abiodun Owolabi; another Executive Director of Operations, Engr Abel N. Imonighavwe; and Executive Director of Finance and Accounts, Mrs Aramide M. Ekundayo.\n\nSalaries, wages, allowances, redundancy and pension costs gulped N22.195 billion. What that means is that, on average, each staff member received N32.88 million in 2019 from a company that made no revenue. This amounted, on the average, to N2.74 million each month.\n\nTotal salaries and pays received by staff members of Port Harcourt refinery between 2017 and 2019 amounted to N80.57 billion. But revenues received by the company within the period were estimated at N6.27 billion \u2013 implying that the NNPC sought N74.3 billion from outside the refinery to pay staff salaries.\n\nRather than privatise the refinery, the NNPC chose to pump an equivalent of 4.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget ($1.5 billion) into the refurbishment of a refinery that comprehensively lost N206.069 billion between 2017 and 2020.\n\nOil and Gas Analyst at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham, Mustapha Wahab said the investment in the refinery made no sense.\n\n\u201cDangote refinery is coming on board and can process about 650,000 barrels per day of crude oil \u2013 highest in the world. NNPC has taken 20 per cent stake in Dangote.\n\n\u201cWhy then are you resuscitating Port Harcourt refinery? We have done the analysis at Chapel Hill Denham and found that government should be spending $3billion or more to ensure efficiency of the refinery. So, it does not make investment sense because you are not going to compete with yourself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo, Some countries are exiting low-carbon energy sources and migrating to clean energy. So, after rehabilitating Port Harcourt refinery, for how long will you enjoy its benefits, given that your market is not just Nigeria but also those countries exiting what you intend to sell to them?\u201d he asked, urging the Nigerian Government to concession it for optimal benefits to the Nigerian economy.\n\nOil and Gas Governance Consultant, Henry Ademola Adigun also noted that the refinery was badly managed.\n\n\u201cThe point is that the refineries are still badly managed. The faster the corporation becomes a limited liability company, the better,\u201d Adigun said.\n\n\u201cYou have a refinery not producing anything and not making revenues but salaries are being paid. How did the NNPC make the profit they said they made when the inefficiencies are there? The profit and loss do not show anything. They simply want to make it attractive to the stockman.\u201d\n\nHe said there was no cost-cutting by the NNPC or the refineries, adding that there were also \u201cno innovative efficiency, no restructuring or replanting and no cost-saving on salaries and wages.\u201d\n\nFormer President of the Nigerian Society of Petroleum Engineers Joe Nwakwue said the only thing that the corporation could have done was to sell off the refineries.\n\n\u201cIf you have a factory and is not producing, you will have to pay the gate man and the even the insurance company.\u201d\n\nThe PHRC was commissioned in 1965. It was made up of two refineries: the old refinery was inaugurated in 1965 with capacity of 60,000 barrels per stream day (bpsd) and the new refinery was inaugurated in 1989 with an installed capacity of 150,000 bpsd, according to the NNPC.\n\nIt has a capacity of 210,000 bpsd with five process areas. In 2000, the then government of Nigeria shut down the refinery for turnaround maintenance. Other three refineries in the country were also expected to undergo a similar process, Oil & Gas Journal said.\n\nAs of that time, $364 million had already been spent on endless turnaround maintenance (TAM) services. About $25 billion has been spent on turnaround maintenance in the past 25 years, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe Institute for Global Energy Research, in a 2004 article, said the barrage of corruption, poor management, sabotage and lack of the mandatory turnaround maintenance (TAM) every two years had made all the refineries inefficient, making them operate at about 40 per cent of full capacity.\n\nThe NNPC said in April 2020 that it would hand over the four refineries in the country to a private firm to manage.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get an O&M contract; NNPC won\u2019t run it. We are going to get a firm that will guarantee that this plant would run for some time. We want to try a different model of getting this refinery to run. And we are going to apply this process for the running of the other two refineries.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not happened.

          "text": "The management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has invited newspaper editors to a Lagos hotel with the intention of bribing them to discredit a recent report about ineptitude, mismanagement and corruption in the state oil and gas company.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the planned meeting with the editors is scheduled for 1pm on Sunday at Legend Hotel, close to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja in Lagos.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari.\n\nA source privy to information regarding the emergency meeting told SaharaReporters it is to bribe editors to discredit a report exposing the incompetence of NNPC executives and their wastefulness.\n\n\u201cThey are inviting some editors to Legend Hotel in Lagos to bribe them to discredit a story published by the ICIR on Friday that really embarrassed them. The meeting is scheduled for 1pm on Sunday (today),\u201d the source said.\n\nThe content of the text message sent out to the invited editors reads: \u201cMeeting of selected editors scheduled for Sunday 12/9/2021 @ 1pm. Venue: Legend Hotel adjacent Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Please confirm, attendance.\u201d\n\nThe report highlighted data collated from audited financial statements released by the NNPC, led by its Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, on Wednesday. The report exposed how Port Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC), which is managed by Ahmed Dikko, an engineer, reported no income in 2020 but incurred administrative expenses of N19.215 billion, paying salaries, wages and other benefits to unproductive workers to the tune of N22.55 billion.\n\nDespite making zero revenue, Port Harcourt refinery employed 487 new workers and paid N23 billion as salaries in 2020.\n\nSaharaReporters also learnt that the NNPC had already sponsored some groups to criticise the damaging report in an attempt to counter its implications by releasing press statements in the media.\n\nFor instance, a coalition of northern and southern groups recently released a joint statement saying the \u201ccontinuous media attacks were designed to distract NNPC Group Managing Director and Port Harcourt Refinery Managing Director\u201d.\n\nThe group said it took a stand during their second-quarter meeting in Kaduna at the weekend, \u201cbecause the attack dogs of haters of the ongoing reforms at the NNPC are going beyond the boundaries of decency\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs Nigerian citizens, we feel duty-bound to draw public attention to a calculated, coordinated and well-funded media agenda designed to purposely distract the NNPC management, including another committed public servant \u2013 Dikko \u2013 who has been leading the reforms at the level of Port Harcourt refinery,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe report on the 2020 financial statement of the company stated that the 487 new workers are being paid N3.93 billion annually, indicating that each of them takes an average of N8.072 million annually or N672,713 monthly.\n\nThe amount they earn monthly is about the annual salary of a normal Level 8 Federal Government worker.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the refinery employed 1,162 new staff members, paying N41.163 billion in salary and wages, according to The ICIR\u2019s calculations of the company\u2019s wage data on its financial statements.\n\nAlso, out of the 487 staff members employed in 2020, 430 were senior and management staff members, amounting to 88.2 per cent, with huge financial implications. Only 57 were junior staff members.\n\nAlso, out of 675 staff engaged by the refinery in 2019, 656 were management and senior staff, members, representing 97 per cent of the total, with huge financial implications.\n\n\u201cIt is looking like jobs for the boys at our dear refineries. And I wonder, most of these guys are earning heavy wages,\u201d US-based Financial Consultant Ellam Ogochukwu said.\n\n\u201cWhoever is running that enterprise deserves to answer several questions,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, staff pension, gratuity and \u2018long service award\u2019 gulped N77.76 billion in 2020 as against N63.41 billion the previous year.\n\nSurprisingly, under Dikko and his boss Kyari, the PHRC\u2019s unproductive staff were allowed to take car loans, compassionate loans and advances valued at N1.001 billion in 2020.\n\nThe amount was N597.297 million in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, this refinery, which made no revenue, incurred a comprehensive loss of N53.179 billion.\n\nIn the previous year, the company made no revenue but incurred N50.530 billion in comprehensive loss.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, the company comprehensively lost N241.609 billion. Its revenue within this period was merely N6.27 billion.\n\n\u201cThis refinery did not produce oil. What you have is that some people just iron their clothes, go to work and come back at the end of the day without adding to the productivity of the company,\u201d Oil and Gas Analyst at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham Mustapha Wahab told The ICIR.\n\nNNPC Managing Director, Kyari is the chairman of Port Harcourt refinery. He is followed by Ahmed Dikko (MD), Babatunde Sofowora (Executive Director of Services), Reginald Udeh (Executive Director, Finance and Accounts), James Ifeanyichukwu Ajibo (Executive Director, Operations), and Awaisu Muazu (late, served till July 2020).\n\nThese directors took N99.742 million as emoluments in 2020, a 67 per cent increase from N59.650 million they took in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, the Port Harcourt refinery did not record any revenue. Yet, it reported N25.19 billion in expenses.\n\nSix directors collected N59.65 million in fees, meaning that each of them received an average payment of N9.94 million a month in 2019.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, names of the six directors in 2019 were: Group Managing Director of NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari; Managing Director, Abba Bukar (who retired in March 2020); Executive Director of Services, Babatunde S. Sofowore; Executive Director of Operations, Ganiyu Abiodun Owolabi; another Executive Director of Operations, Engr Abel N. Imonighavwe; and Executive Director of Finance and Accounts, Mrs Aramide M. Ekundayo.\n\nSalaries, wages, allowances, redundancy and pension costs gulped N22.195 billion. What that means is that, on average, each staff member received N32.88 million in 2019 from a company that made no revenue. This amounted, on the average, to N2.74 million each month.\n\nTotal salaries and pays received by staff members of Port Harcourt refinery between 2017 and 2019 amounted to N80.57 billion. But revenues received by the company within the period were estimated at N6.27 billion \u2013 implying that the NNPC sought N74.3 billion from outside the refinery to pay staff salaries.\n\nRather than privatise the refinery, the NNPC chose to pump an equivalent of 4.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget ($1.5 billion) into the refurbishment of a refinery that comprehensively lost N206.069 billion between 2017 and 2020.\n\nOil and Gas Analyst at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham, Mustapha Wahab said the investment in the refinery made no sense.\n\n\u201cDangote refinery is coming on board and can process about 650,000 barrels per day of crude oil \u2013 highest in the world. NNPC has taken 20 per cent stake in Dangote.\n\n\u201cWhy then are you resuscitating Port Harcourt refinery?

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s largest telecom company MTN Group is reportedly in talks with potential international buyers for its wireless business in Afghanistan per Bloomberg.\n\nThis is part of the company\u2019s plans to accelerate its exit from the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe South Africa headquartered company is currently the market leader in Afghanistan with a 40% share and is in discussions with several parties in ongoing negotiations to sell its Afghanistan arm. A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets. The carrier earlier this year abandoned its operation in Syria, citing regulatory demands that made operating there untenable; last month the carrier stated that it was still evaluating options in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe sale of its Afghanistan unit is crucial to MTN as it plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa. The proceeds will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nUnlike MTN, the other telecom companies operating in Afghanistan, which also includes state-owned Afghan Wireless and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates, have reassured customers and investors that services will keep running following the collapse of the US-backed government last month while trying to secure the safety of their employees in the country.\n\nMTN currently serves over six million customers in Afghanistan, its planned exit could serve as an opportunity for other Afghanistan telecom players to expand their market share, while MTN does the same in Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCBN\u2019s new directive to banks and payment service providers\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s partnership with MTN Group\n\nMTN Nigeria securing a licence renewal for another ten years\n\nCBN\u2019s new directive to banks and payment service providers (PSPs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Businesstimes.ng\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has directed banks and payment service providers (PSPs), via a circular, to begin processing end-to-end bulk payments or transfers on their platforms and to track accounts that receive credits in the custody of the sender\u2019s bank.\n\nHow were things done before? Originating banks and PSPs passed a debit entry through the initiating customer\u2019s account and multiple credits to beneficiaries without keeping adequate records of the credit entries in their system. This, reportedly, altered the audit trail and reduced transparency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with the new method, all end-to-end bulk payments or transfers for customers are processed on the platforms of banks or PSPs, with a detailed breakdown of the accounts that receive the credits held in the sender\u2019s bank\u2019s custody.\n\nThe payment technique currently used by banks and other payment providers, according to CBN, inhibits transparency and alters the audit trail.\n\nDid you know? In August 2021, the CBN ordered all commercial banks to publish the names and Bank Verification Numbers (BVNs) of customers who use fraudulent and unscrupulous methods to obtain foreign exchange from banks on their websites.\n\nThe CBN said that the fraudulent practices include using forged visas and cancelling airline tickets following the purchase of Personal Travel Allowance and Business Travel Allowance.\n\nThe CBN also emphasised that all banks and PSPs should fully comply with the new requirement and other payment system regulations.\n\nFlutterwave partners with MTN Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican payments startup, Flutterwave, has announced a partnership with MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms company, to enable businesses in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia to accept payments via MTN Mobile Money (MoMo).\n\nWhat does this mean? Flutterwave can now offer MTN MoMo as a payment method to its business customers.\n\nIn August 2021, Flutterwave appointed Jimmy Ku as Head of US Growth to drive US expansion and offer payment services to US-based clients, local businesses, and companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the startup is announcing a partnership with MTN to improve local economies and livelihoods, as well as create opportunities for individuals and businesses across the continent.\n\nMTN MoMo is a fintech platform that offers an electronic wallet to consumers and businesses and access to digital and financial services.\n\nPer Statista, the number of active MoMo users grew from 35.1 million in March 2020 to 46.6 million in March 2021. This means MoMo had 11.5 million active users in one year.\n\nFlutterwave and MTN Group believe that this partnership will extend their previous partnership beyond Uganda and Rwanda to deepen the adoption of digital payments and e-commerce in Africa. This market is estimated to reach $29 billion by 2022.\n\nMTN Nigeria secures licence renewal for another 10 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has renewed MTN Nigeria\u2019s Unified Access Service (UAS) licence and spectrum licence for wireless local loop in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands.\n\nAccording to MTN, the renewal is subject to licence requirements, including additional payments, which are currently being discussed.\n\nThe telecom giant also said that the Commission acknowledged receiving \u20a671.6 billion for the spectrum licence and \u20a6374.6 million for the UAS licence in payment of their invoices for the ten years ending August 31, 2031.\n\nAccording to Karl Toriola, MTN Nigeria CEO, renewing MTN\u2019s licences for the next ten years is important because it allows the company to keep offering services to ensure Nigerians enjoy the benefits of a modern connected life.\n\nThe licence renewal for MTN Nigeria comes as the telecoms industry marked the twentieth anniversary of the commercial launch of digital mobile services by Econet Wireless Nigeria (now Airtel Nigeria) and MTN Nigeria in August 2001.\n\nMTN Nigeria got its first licence from the NCC in January 2001 for $285 million. On May 16, 2001, it became the first GSM network to make a call, ahead of Econet (now Airtel), which received the operating licence first from the NCC.\n\nInterestingly, after two decades of operations in the country, we discussed the telecom giants\u2019 remarkable milestones.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s first Windows 11 commercial features Master Chief blowing stuff up.

Nigerian fintech startup, Prospa, has closed a $3.8 million pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, this pre-seed raise is the largest of its kind in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa. However, there\u2019ve been bigger rounds from Northern Africa, such as Telda\u2019s $5 million pre-seed.\n\nThe round saw investments from Facebook, Global Founders Capital, executives at Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square, and Immad Akhund, CEO of American fintech company Mercury.\n\nWhat does Prospa do? The startup provides banking services for micro and small businesses. Business owners can open a functioning business account on the platform in minutes.\n\nBasically another online bank?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeka was eight years old when he dropped out of primary school. He couldn\u2019t read and write at the time, and his environment was not conducive for learning.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary school, I used to think I wasn\u2019t cut out for school. And the fact that I was living in the village didn\u2019t help matters. My classmates would tease me, which would discourage and make me sad,\u201d he recounts.\n\nAccording to African Library Project (ALP), a non-profit organisation that builds libraries in rural Africa, 22% (30 million) of Africa\u2019s primary-aged children were not enrolled in school in 2019.\n\nThe ALP also says that 48 million youth aged 15 to 24 are illiterate, while more than 1 in 3 adults cannot read. This translates to 182 million adults who are unable to read and write.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Statista, 66.8% of Africans aged 15 and above could read, write, and understand a simple statement in 2019. With an 80% literacy rate, Southern Africa ranked highest, with Northern, Eastern, and Central Africa recording rates above 70%. In West Africa, however, only 51% of adults could read or write.\n\nEmeka believed he wasn\u2019t cut out for school because he could neither read nor write. Something which could easily have been attributed to dyslexia, a learning disability.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that a developmental delay, such as a literacy delay, is not the same as a developmental disability.\n\nDistinguishing development delays from developmental disabilities\n\nA developmental delay simply means that a child is behind on some developmental milestones; it does not indicate a specific health problem.\n\nDevelopmental delays can occur in cognition, communication, behaviour, socialisation or emotional functioning, and motor abilities. That children have any of these delays doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t match their peers.\n\nTherefore, according to Healthline \u2014 an American website that provides medical information and health advice \u2014 early intervention and treatment can help a child achieve normal development as they mature. A delay indicates that the child\u2019s learning problems will be corrected if given enough time.\n\nA developmental disability, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder with long-term outcomes. And the World Health Organization (WHO) states that most disabilities have three dimensions: impairment, activity limitation, and participation limits.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an overlap\n\nStudies have shown that determining whether a child has a developmental delay or a disability can be difficult because a delay can be an early sign of a learning disability, which is not the same as a physical disability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, most professionals can\u2019t detect learning disabilities until a child is old enough to show deficits in courses like math, reading, and spelling.\n\nDespite Emeka\u2019s literacy delay, he could have improved significantly in a better school environment, with supportive parents and early intervention using tech tools. But he only began to make some progress when he was 20 years old after he arrived in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start to learn how to read and write until I came to Lagos about four years ago. You know, I was surprised to see children as young as seven read and write. That prompted me to buy a smartphone,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWhen mobile phones play a part in literacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Borgen Project, an organisation in the United States focused on improving poverty through online and community presence, reported that mobile phones help thousands of people in developing countries learn to read.\n\nFor emphasis, a different study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Africans use mobile technology for texting.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, illiteracy in Africa is caused in part by a lack of books. It states that this situation is amplified by Africa\u2019s rapidly growing student population, resulting in textbook-to-pupil ratios of 1:11 for reading and 1:13 for arithmetic in some countries.\n\nHowever, mobile phones can help solve this problem. Before the widespread use of mobile phone technology, Africa\u2019s adult literacy rate (pdf) stood at 52%; by 2008, the literacy rate had risen to 63%.\n\nWith a smartphone, Emeka\u2019s ability to read and write improved while using Google Voice, Google Translate, and Predictive Text before he could start writing and reading. It also helped that he had supportive friends.\n\nBesides the tools Emeka used, there are many options to choose from.\n\nThree tech tools to improve literacy\n\n1. Read Along\n\nFormerly Bolo, Read Along is a free Google-developed language-learning app for children launched on March 7, 2019, to help children have fun while learning to read.\n\nRead Along includes an in-app reading companion that coaches children by listening to them while they read aloud, offering assistance when they get stuck, and awarding stars when they succeed.\n\nIt works best for children who already have a basic understanding of the English alphabet.\n\n2. Rewordify\n\nCreated by Illinois-based high school special education teacher, Neil Goldman, Rewordify allows you to copy and paste any text. It also replaces difficult words with simpler ones.\n\nDepending on the settings, those simplified words can replace the original ones, be seen with a mouse click, or displayed next to the difficult words. It appears to be very sophisticated, and the precision of the simplified word choices is exceptional. Unlike some other websites, Rewordify does not just display word definitions.\n\nFurthermore, teachers can use the site to create various learning activities based on the text that students can complete.\n\n3. Newsela\n\nNewsela is an Instructional Content Platform that brings together engaging, accessible content with integrated assessments and insights to supercharge reading engagement and learning in every subject. Content on Newsela covers topics students care about that connect to the core curriculum and align with standards.\n\nThis app and website, designed for pupils just learning to read and write, does a great job of combining how to read and write engagingly. Letter sounds are taught in small groups and include audio and physical cues for learning \u2014 students will hear the sounds and trace the letters with their fingers or a stylus.\n\nIt includes a spelling game and sends weekly update emails to parents and teachers.\n\nThese and other tech tools have revealed the importance of technology on literacy as these tools are available to everyone, regardless of age.\n\nLiteracy is crucial in social and economic development. It expands knowledge, and a literate person is more likely to understand and adjust to society. Increased literacy in youth and adults has the power to change Africa.\n\nTherefore, access to technology, the Internet, mobile phones, and tech tools are critical to closing the gap between increased illiteracy rates and the challenges in the way.",

          "title": "VAT, anti-open grazing laws push Nigeria closer to fiscal federalism",
          "text": "Gradually but steadily; silently but effectively, a revolution is taking place in Nigeria that will ultimately yield a saner society that will stand and thrive on equity, justice and fair-play in the way the people live and relate with one another.\n\nA lot of anomalies have been forced down the throat of Nigerians with arrogance and impunity and, with the tax war now raging between the states and the Federal Government, it does seem that the people have had their fill and therefore, cannot take it anymore.\n\nThe Federal Government has, all along, been too overbearing in playing its big brother role such that, with the ethnic and religious sentiments that lace every consideration in the country, the government has taken its role to a very ridiculous level, making itself an irritant in the process.\n\nThe tax war, which started as a melodrama with Rivers and Lagos State governments contesting right to VAT collection with the Federal Government has taken a new twist as 36 states of the federation, through their Attorneys-General, have dragged the Federal Government to the Supreme Court over alleged failure to remit funds generated from stamp duties into state accounts.\n\nPolitical pundits say that the tax war, the anti-open grazing bills and all other forms of agitations that the country has seen in recent times are only symptoms of a new consciousness that is evolving, intent on letting the government and its handlers know that silence does not always mean ignorance or weakness.\n\nFollowing recent actions of some governors, especially on unresolved fiscal issues that have retarded the country\u2019s economic growth, it seems other tiers of government are waking up, challenging the status quo and tasking government on true federalism.\n\nOf interest are ensuing debates on the issue across the country, as many are supporting states to square-up with the Federal Government on contentious issues, as the constitution empowers them rather than the compromise that often weakens them.\n\nRead Also: VAT: Expected winners, losers if sharing formula changes\n\nUntil recently, no state had mustered the courage to challenge the Federal Government-empowered Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on collecting revenue even when they are due and constitutional for the states to do so.\n\nThanks to Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State governor, for belling the cat. The governor recently signed into law the bill that authorizes the state to collect Value Added Tax (VAT), hitherto collected by the FIRS.\n\nFurther authenticating the bill is a ruling by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt that states, and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), should be collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax.\n\nThis is not the first time the court is ruling in favour of states, especially fiscal matters. It would be recalled that on July 19, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Lagos State government on the right to make laws on tourism, specifically where the National Assembly had already legislated on the same issue through the NTDC Act.\n\nWith that ruling, the debate on the constitutionality of the Lagos State Hotel Licensing Law 2003 (and its amendment) and the Hotel Occupancy and Restaurant Consumption Law 2009 enacted by Lagos State were finally laid to rest as the state went ahead with the enforcement of its laws on hotels, consumption tax, among others.\n\nThe Lagos State House of Assembly, in what seems like borrowing a leaf from Rivers, last Thursday passed into law the VAT and anti-open grazing bills.\n\nRead Also: Anti-open grazing: Lagos, Ogun, Edo, Anambra, Osun delaying law\n\nIn an apparent speed of lightening the following day, Friday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu signed the bill into law.\n\nBut while the VAT case is a huge victory for the states and fiscal liberation, many fear that the Federal Government may likely challenge the Federal High Court\u2019s ruling up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThis is one victory all the states should celebrate because it is moving Nigeria away from unnecessary control by the Federal Government. State should be allowed fiscal autonomy as guaranteed by the constitution and this is happening in our time,\u201d Chijioke Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, enthused.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the disparity in the revenue sharing formula is already hurting states and denying them resources for development as much of the resources are domiciled with the Federal Government.\n\nFor Tanko Usman, an Abuja-based tax expert, the High Court ruling in favour of the states is worth celebrating because the Federal Government has been collecting so much revenue and even in areas where states are constitutionally empowered to do so.\n\n\u201cWith the ruling, every state can now improve its revenue collection. Those who argue that the states will exploit and squander the new revenue source, should also ask what development the Federal Government has supported with the billions it collected from VAT all these years\u201d.\n\nUsman insisted that the ruling is a welcome development; a signal that free meals for the Federal Government are over and time allows states to exercise all their constitutional rights for even development across the country.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an opportunity to grow our business\u2019\n\nMagnus Onuba, a petroleum products marketer in Port Harcourt, expressed joy over the court ruling, noting that it will address the issue of multiple taxation and harassment by federal and state tax agents.\n\n\u201cAt least, we know that it is only the state we can pay to. This is a tax relief for us and an opportunity to grow our businesses\u201d, he said.\n\nJimoh Otunla, a Lagos hotelier, is happy as well, noting that the ruling is going to take off a huge burden from hoteliers.\n\n\u201cGuests complain that Lagos hotels are expensive because of the over 20 taxes and levies we pay to the Federal, state and local governments. With the state collecting the VAT, it will be easier for us to handle than federal and no more double taxation,\u201d Otunla said.\n\nIt has set path for restructuring\n\nWith the VAT law, Tony Abolo, a development economist, said it has set the path for restructuring \u201cwhich will be interpreted as fiscal federalism which will have an effect on other devolution in the country if it is finally upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nAccording to him, it has also opened the door for restructuring and the possibility of resolving certain inequities in the system.\n\n\u201cIt is an interpretation of the law because you know, in Nigeria, we don\u2019t do judicial activism. We take laws that are made or take the constitution as it is and begin to complain or agitate without going into the substance of the matter. So, the Rivers State opened their eyes and decided to make certain parts of the constitution justiciable and therefore, led to this VAT decision.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why Lagos has grown its IGR using law activism to be able to create avenues for itself and every state ought to open its eyes. But in Edo, there is no engagement with the people in this government. Now, the issue of VAT came, and instead of the state government to find a way around it, make money and let the economy of the state run, they seem not to be interested,\u201d Abolo added.\n\nAyo Adebanjo, leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, said the development was what Nigerians had been clamouring for.\n\n\u201cAll we are asking now is let what is desirable be done. Nigeria is a federal state; it was clear injustice for the Federal Government to be collecting VAT. Look at America; the richest state gets most of its money from same source. For history, the issue was settled in 1954, before Independence; it was the military that brought us back to this system in 1964 and we are saying let go back,\u201d Adebanjo said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt should be the state that should collect VAT. Back then, Awolowo told Sardauna, your people don\u2019t drink, but you are collecting the proceeds that come from them, what do you want me to do with my people who drink? Look at the clear injustice in Rivers State; a large fraction of the money generated from VAT is not given to them; even Lagos and the rest; that should not be allowed in a federal system.\n\n\u201cI have always said it that if Nigeria does not practise true federal system, we would not get justice. The military destroyed the system, turning all sort of laws that would make the country grow like its peers upside down. And that is why we are saying that we must restructure the country, which they have refused because they want to continue with this injustice.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be cheated forever with impunity, all these things were spelt out in the Constitution, the roles of the state, federal and their powers.\u201d\n\nMonday Ubani, a former second vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), said: \u201cI am in support of the states collecting VAT; that is what it should be in a true federalism; I mean federal state. It is what we have been talking about and as you can see, it was clear injustice for the Federal Government to be doing that in the first place.\u201d\n\nEddy Olafeso, a former People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) national vice chairman South West, said the development \u201cis an eye opener.\u201d\n\nOlafeso said: \u201cYou cannot be denied freedom for ever. For the Federal Government, it is an eye opener; they would soon realise they are alone on this matter. I mean things would change more. People have been clamouring for federalism and they are not talking out of point because it is what it should be. I expect other states to follow suit in Nigeria and you can see that Lagos State has not only passed a bill but has also gone ahead to sign the bill into law. You cannot sit somewhere and expect others to generate money and share with you. It has to stop. Federalism is the way forward, and it is coming like this gradually; of course, they may not want it for obvious reasons.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the signing of the anti-open grazing by most states in the southern part of the country is also further exercising of the states\u2019 constitutional powers.\n\nObservers think that the state governors who have signed the anti-open grazing into law are listening to the yearnings of their people who have lost innocent lives, farm crops, lands, houses and money to the several attacks by herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThe state lawmakers made the law, the governor signed to authenticate it, hence any defaulter will be prosecuted because not doing so undermines the legitimacy of the House of Assembly that made the law and most importantly, the authority of the state. I see the law reducing the attacks and activities of gun-wielding herders,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nBut Tanko Usman thinks that it is not signing the anti-open grazing law, but the enforcement as some herders will dear the states, knowing that they have people in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cI hope the states are setting up a taskforce to enforce the new law and not just signing the bill into law,\u201d he said.\n\nToeing Usman\u2019s line, Umelahi feared that some state governors who are seeking attention from Aso Rock may likely not sign the bill into law, giving the herders access to places that are \u2018pro-open grazing\u2019, which should not be.\n\n\u201cDespite the outcry by most southern states, the President still signed the PIB bill into law; so why will someone stop southern states if they think there is need for laws to protect their people, their land and economy?\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nSome observers have also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on Miyetti Allah to enable them desist from making provoking comments and inciting their members against innocent citizens.\n\nAhmed Ajayi, a farmer, said that the press conference held recently by the Miyetti Allah against the Southern States that have decided to outlaw open grazing, was in bad faith.\n\n\u201cImagine a group whose members have been causing havoc across the country, having the temerity to attack states that are seeking ways to protect their people. They were saying all manner of things against Governor Samuel Ortom. Their comments were infuriating, saying has the ban on open grazing in Benue checked the killings? That was being too arrogant. I am sure that with the developments in Rivers, Lagos and other states, we will begin to experience some measure of sanity in society,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nAppeal Court stops Rivers, Lagos until\u2026\n\nThe Court of Appeal in Abuja has halted the Rivers State government from collecting Value Added Taxes VAT until all legal disputes relating to the matter are resolved.\n\nThe court ordered that the judgment of the state high court from which the state drew authorities to collect the tax be implemented.\n\nJustice Haruna Simon Tsammani who issued the order in Abuja on Friday also directed that the law passed by Rivers State House of Assembly and assented to by Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike must not be implemented.\n\nThe appellate court held that since parties have submitted themselves to the authorities of the court for adjudication of the matter, they must not do anything that will destroy the subject matter of the appeal.\n\nIn specific terms, Justice Tsammani granted status quo ante in favour of the Federal Inland Revenue Services and against the respondents.\n\nThe matter has been slated for September 16 for a hearing of the motion for joinder by Lagos State.\n\nFIRS, in an appeal marked CA/PH/282/2021, is praying the court to set aside the judgment of a Rivers State High Court which granted powers to the state to collect Value Added Tax, VAT.\n\nThe tax collection agency is also asking the appellate court to stay the execution of Rivers\u2019 judgment.",
          "summary": "Thanks to Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State governor, for belling the cat.\nThe governor recently signed into law the bill that authorizes the state to collect Value Added Tax (VAT), hitherto collected by the FIRS.\nThe Lagos State House of Assembly, in what seems like borrowing a leaf from Rivers, last Thursday passed into law the VAT and anti-open grazing bills.\nNigeria is a federal state; it was clear injustice for the Federal Government to be collecting VAT.\nThe matter has been slated for September 16 for a hearing of the motion for joinder by Lagos State.",

          "text": "For winning the value Added Tax (VAT) war, Rivers State is to jump for annual gross revenue of N448billion to N610billion.\n\nThe VAT case has gone to Appeal Court but Rivers State has won a vital leg, which is stay-of-execution as the court ruled that the judgment of the High Court remains without staying the execution while the substantive case goes on.\n\nBy this, from end of September 2021, the state government will begin to be the one to collect VAT from businesses.\n\nThe case had challenged the powers of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to collect VAT and some other levies such as Personal Income Tax, Withholding Tax, Education Tax, and Technology Levy.\n\nThe justice, Stephen Dalyop Pam, shocked the nation when he ruled with an order of perpetual injunction restraining the FIRS and the Attorney General of the federation from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personal income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nPam made the order while delivering judgment in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS, first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nRead Also: Rivers set to collect September VAT \u2013 Wike\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there is no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology Levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the Federal Government is limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains which do not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nPam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the State government are issues of law that the court is constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it is entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it is the State and not FIRS that is constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the Federal Government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants are not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nAmong the reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, is a declaration that the constitutional power of the Federal Government to impose taxes and duties is only limited to the items listed in items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the second schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nThe Rivers State immediately set in motion the structures to begin immediate collection of VAT. The FIRS went on appeal and demanded for a stay-of-execution. On Tuesday, September 8, 2021, the Appal Court rejected the stay-of-execution plea. This sent wild jubilations in the state administration.\n\nThe governor summoned the business community and announced that the state would come asking for VAT by end of September. The governor went ahead to reveal how VAT was being shared in Nigeria.\n\nHe made lamentations: Rivers State in July 2021 got a mere N4.7bn from a collection of N15.1bn whereas Kano that collected N2.8bn got N2.8bn back as VAT. Lagos fetched N46bn but got N9.3bn back. He said most northern states destroy alcoholic drinks and shut down leisure centres and miss VAT only to double back and collect VAT realised from sin-spots in southern states.\n\nHow Rivers IGR profile will change\n\nBy this revelation, Rivers State now get average of N15bn from VAT every month and will not remit a kobo. This will be N180bn in the next one year instead of the N18bn it had expected for one year from paltry remittances from the FG.\n\nThis would add to the state\u2019s N448bn expected in 2021 to now be N610bn by end of August 2022.\n\nThe state\u2019s monthly IGR of N8.5bn estimated for 2021 will henceforth be N23bn per month. By this, Rivers State earn N276bn from IGR every year, which is enough to either pick up its entire N180bn recurrent expenditure per year or cover its entire capital budget of N268bn.\n\nRivers State had always wanted to meet at least 50 per cent of its annual expenditure through IGR. By this development, the state would now meet up to 65 per cent of this.\n\nThe most impact would be in paying salaries and overhead without waiting for federal allocation, or paying contractors without waiting for allocation, whichever it chooses.\n\nConspiracy of the states?\n\nSources said the governors had always known they were being shortchanged and it would require a court order to win it back. The problem was who to bell the cat without picking bullets. This was the stage when the one-time governor of Akwa Ibom State, Victor Attah, took the FG to court under Olusegun Obasanjo on OffShore revenue issue. He was believed to have been victimised a lot.\n\nNyesom Wike did not bat an eyelid. He was seen to be looking for such opportunity and made mince meat of it and won big.\n\nNow, Lagos, which renders over N46bn every month to VAT purse and gets a mere N9bn has enacted its own VAT law, allocating 75 percent to the state and 25 percent to the local councils. Nothing for the FG, an indication of the huge revenue loss to the FG and states with little VAT grossing.\n\nOther states are said to be warming up while some others are said to be afraid of doing so to avoid losing favour up north. This, coming same time with anti-open grazing laws in some states seems to mean one thing, that a major north-south divide has begun.\n\nIt also may mean that the failure of the FG in the past 22 years of the return of democracy to re-engineer Nigeria along true federalism may be a grave mistake. Sources say restructuring may be happening unplanned and this may be worse.\n\nBut troubles seem to lie ahead\n\nMany fear that with violence heading south, and with apparent financial strangulation of the north on the way; that the north may react in desperate ways and this may usher in a big conflict between the two regions.\n\nThe sources said those making peaceful restructuring impossible may be making break-up or violent restructuring possible and faster.\n\nSigns are everywhere that northern states are beginning to take stock of their advantages and strike lines. As more pressure piles on them, it is not certain the way they would strike back.\n\nOthers however, argue that signs from the north of not allowing power to return to the south as agreed may win support for southern revolt through capturing of economic structures.\n\nThe future looks uncertain, they say.",

          "text": "Street food like no other: The best Suya spots in Lagos\n\nEvery culture has it. Their own special way of grilling meat.\n\nIn East Africa, they call it nyamachoma, in southern Africa, it is called shisanyama, in Senegal, it is called dibbi, in Sudan, it\u2019s agashe and in Nigeria, we call it suya.\n\nFor our non-Nigerian readers, suya is a traditional street food that has been responsible for the cravings of millions of people for decades.\n\nIt is a delicacy that you must try if you ever set foot in the country. Suya is the creation of northern Nigeria. The Hausa, the Tuareg, and the Berber tribes have a similar North African culinary culture, with meat featuring heavily in their cuisines or tsire is a spicy meat skewer that is a popular food in Nigeria.\n\nSuya is generally made with a skewered beef, ram or chicken. Innards such as kidneys, liver, and tripe are also used.\n\nThe thinly sliced meat is marinated in various spices which include peanut cake, salt, vegetable oil, and other flavourings, and then barbecued. Suya is served with extra helpings of dried pepper mixed with spices and sliced onions.\n\nDue to its popularity, you can find a suya spot in Lagos every 4-5 minutes. Suya is not a part of the mainstream restaurant dining experience and I think it\u2019s okay like this, as suya is not just about eating grilled meat, it\u2019s a whole experience on its own.\n\nSome places offer suya on the menu but nothing beats the taste of suya from a Mai Suya (a suya seller). Suya preparation is not for the novice. It is a skill but also an art that must be learned. Suya chefs are those who know how to prepare the spices and skew the meat before placing them on the grill.\n\nRead also: Is Slow the most exclusive restaurant in Lagos?\n\nExperience and expertise are needed in order to bring out the unique taste of suya. It is a wonderful pleasure to experience at least once in a lifetime in Lagos.\n\nSuya can be delicious but can also cause serious indigestion if bought from the wrong place. We have therefore put together a list of places in Lagos we love to get Suya from.\n\nPolo Club Suya\n\nLocated in Ikoyi, the polo club is a members-only club known for polo matches, networking, and socialising.\n\nHowever, Lagosians know that possibly the best thing about the polo club is the suya they offer. I have never had stomach issues from their suya and it is just yummy. Whenever I crave suya, I remember that Yakubu, the main man behind the delicious grills, does house deliveries.\n\nGlover Court Suya\n\nFor 20 years Glover Court has been offering delicious Suya. As the name indicates, Glover Court is located on Glover Court in Ikoyi. In my humble opinion, it\u2019s a close second to polo club Suya, and I also love the fact that they sell Massa and northern Nigerian drinks right in the same complex. The food is delicious and the service excellent. To avoid the lines that can sometimes be long (a great testimony to the delicious nature of the Glover Court Suya), you can also order online via https://www.glovercourtsuya.com.ng/.\n\nSooyah Bistro, Surelere\n\nWith 6 locations across Lagos, Sooyah Bistro is fast becoming a favourite around town. They have also been very creative with their menu and offer a variety of options. Whether you are in Illupeju, Suruelere, Landmark Beach, Lekki, or Ikeja, Sooya bistro has you covered. We tried the one in Surulere. You can order here: https://surulere.sooyahbistro.com/\n\nUniversity of Suya\n\nAs the name suggests the University of Suya is notoriously known as an expert when it comes to grilling suya. Located on Allen Avenue Ikeja, they have a reputation to be one of the best in town.\n\nAkerele Hub\n\nLocated in Suruelere, on the mainland, Akerele Hub boasts some of the freshest suya in Lagos. Make sure to check them out.\n\nThere you have it. A list of the best Suya spots in Lagos for the next time that craving kicks in!",

          "title": "NNPC N287bn Profit: Atedo Peterside Got it wrong \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLike doubting Thomas, Founder of IBTC Stanbic Bank, Atedo Peterside, in a tweet Sunday, 29 August called out the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to clarify a spurious allegation that it dipped its fingers in the federation account in order to announce a profit of N287bn.\n\nHe was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s public presentation of NNPC\u2019s audit report which posted a profit ofN287bn for the very first time in 44 years of the existence of the corporation. But a couple of questions for Atade Peterside and his ilk: is it possible for an entity, signatories of a corporation to dip their hands into the federation account? Does this make any sense? Obviously, their allegation is a white lie from the pit of hell that should be spurned by well meaning Nigerians.\n\nThe 2020 Audited Financial Statement of the NNPC is on its website for all to see as the current managers believe there is nothing to hide. The highlights of the 2020 AFS revealed that while the corporation\u2019s financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7% compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4% within the same period. The group working capital remained below the line at N4.56trillion in 2020 as against N.44trillion in 2019, a decrease that could be attributed to the decline in the production of crude oil due to global impact of Covid-19. It is important to emphasise that this is the third consecutive year, the NNPC under the watch of Mele Kyari is publishing its Audited Financial Statement. Should such a fellow be condemned or praised?\n\nNigerians can readily recall that President Muhammadu Buhari promised to turn around the fortunes of the then ailing national oil corporation and reposition it for profitability. This was the chief reason why he appointed Mallam Mele Kyari as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC in the first place. The strategy for the current handlers was clear: curb wastes, fight corruption, ensure transparency and accountability in line with the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Open Government Partnership (OGP), both multi-stakeholder global initiatives, to which Nigeria is signatory, but more importantly, in keeping with his administration\u2019s electoral promises to Nigerians.\n\nWhen in 2019 Financial Audit Statement, the NNPC age-long losses were reduced from N803bn to N1.7bn, it was obvious that the corporation was heading somewhere pursuant to government\u2019s agenda to turn around the fortunes of the NNPC. It was clear that if the right measures and controls were sustained, the corporation will eventually break the age-long jinx and so many watchers of events at the nation\u2019s oil corporation weren\u2019t too surprised when it eventually declared a net profit of N287billion in year 2020.\n\nThis, in my view, calls for celebration of persons who made it happen because, for the first time in its 44-year history, the bugaboo of NNPC having to make profits has been broken. It is common knowledge that the corporation under previous administrations and GMDs was a cesspool of corruption and notorious for national economic hemorrhage and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs). But all that is now history and people like Atedo Peterside are stupefied with the reality. They marvel in disbelief that something good is coming out of Nazareth. Peterside and his co-travelers can bear witness to the fact that there was no publication of annual financial statements until 2018 when Malam Kyari released the very first Audited Financial Statement of account of the NNPC. But the question to ask at this point is: where was Atedo Peterside and his breed all those years? He was never known, seen or heard to have asked any sort of question or comment he just made. Was Peterside not alive then? Has he suddenly woken up from slumber or just suddenly arrived from the moon to join the fray in making such unfounded allegation?\n\nNigerians are now home to the delivery of promised transparency and accountability by the current NNPC management. Acrimonious and distractive elements like Atedo Peterside do not need to make spurious, baseless and untenable allegations against the leadership of the NNPC. Apparently, Mele Kyari and his management team, working with the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari, have ensured that the NNPC did not only take steps to end the era of posting losses, but have gone ahead over time to post profit as revealed in the 2020 audit. Methinks they should be commended and not vilified by meddlesome interlopers.\n\nThe argument of Atedo Peterside that the NNPC ought not to post profit in year 2020 that had the covid-19 challenge falls flat on its face because, Atedo\u2019s Peterside\u2019s IBTC Stanbik Bank also posted profit same year of covid-19 devastation. Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc reported a profit after tax (PAT) of N83.211 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, showing an increase of 109 per cent compared to N75.035 billion in 2019.So where lies the argument that the NNPC shouldn\u2019t have posted profit in the year of economic crisis occasioned by covid-19. Why did they not post heavy losses to substantiate the point that no profit can be made in 2020, year of pandemic? It is common knowledge that covid was a global problem- while some oragnisations made profits, others suffered losses. That is business life for you and nobody should deride the other just to score cheap political or sectional point.\n\nIt is instructive to emphasise that Nigerians should not play ethnic or political cards when it comes to national economic issues. Better still, Atedo Peterside can throw his hat into the Nigerian political ring for the 2023 presidency or Governorship of his state so that he would have a first-hand experience in the political crucibles of this nation and for him to properly play politics in the real practical sense of the word instead of hiding under a business name to do so.\n\nNigerians are glad that, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari who was the target of the media onslaught against the corporation since the release of the 2020 audit report equally came out on TVC News to clarify that the 2020 profit was very low and a very small number. In his words: \u201cThis is potentially a trillion-naira company and of course with all expectation and all resources available to us, we should not be declaring losses at any time.\u201d Impliedly, the 2021 audit will post more profit than the 2020 FAS and the trend will not only continue, but have come to stay to perpetually shame Atade Peterside and his sort.\n\nWhen we use public space, sometimes, we forget that history lay ambush with a note pad. For the avoidance of doubt, Mele Kyari has been part of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) long before he became the GMD of the NNPC and I have personally met him in a number of NEITI meetings where he liberally canvassed the need for transparency and accountability in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry. It was therefore not surprising when appointed GMD he has given tacit support to implementation and abided by the general principles of the EITI in all his undertakings.\n\nUnder his watch, the NNPC joined a group of over 65 extractives companies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), commodity traders, financial institutions and industry partners committed to observing the EITI\u2019s supporting company expectations.\n\nThe NNPC we know before the coming on board of Mele Kyari and his management team operated as an opaque institution. This was pointed by NEITI in the very first forensic audit report which covered 1999-2004. As a matter of fact, since its inception in 2004, the NEITI has conducted eight independent audits in the oil and gas sector (1999\u20132004, 2005, 2006-2008, 2009-2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015) and one in the solid minerals sector (2015). All the reports have always been accompanied with recommendations based on findings relating to violations of stipulated laws and regulations on revenue or tax remittances by companies or receipts by government and its agencies.\n\nRegrettably, as a close stakeholder, majority of these recommendations have always been observed in breach by the companies and the various government agencies, as there are no legal authority to NEITI to enforce compliance or issue sanctions for ignoring them.\n\nConcerned about the recurring disregard to the recommendations in the NEITI audit reports, Mele Kyari, one of the earliest supporters of NEITI in the NNPC and his current management team chose to do things differently by working to bring an end to the era of opacity in the NNPC. Come on, this should be applauded by Nigerians and lovers of democracy anywhere in the world.\n\nTo demonstrate his commitment to taking NNPC to a profit-making corporation, Mele Kyari launched the Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) programme. The programme ensures elimination of discretions, automation of processes and documents, sustained stakeholders communications, evolvement of a culture of openness and disclosure as well as sharing of knowledge and data with deliberate creation of spaces for feedback and implementation of open contracting processes all geared towards transparency in the NNPC.\n\nIn the area of Accountability, TAPE ensures strict adherence to NNPC\u2019s business ethics, policies and procedures, ensure reliability in financial reporting as well as need to ensure the non-betrayal of the trust of over 200million Nigerians.\n\nTo ensure performance excellence, the Mele Kyari-led management set clear objectives and targets, capacity building and empowerment of staff and creation of value addition to NNPC bottom line, while making operational effectiveness and efficiency the new mantra of the corporation. This never happened in the history of the NNPC.\n\nMuch more, the Oil and Gas industry is now governed by a Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) with couple of sections dedicated to transparency and accountability in line with the current management\u2019s New Way of Working. These are novel and deft moves that the oil industry needed over the years but was deprived by forces of darkness in power that never wished the nation any good.\n\nIt was not therefore not any surprise to industry watchers that the NNPC steadily moved from drastic reduction in losses to posting profit in 2020. Our collective prayer is that this streak should endure so that the fortunes of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry can continue to flourish before the phase-out of the use of fossil fuel in Nigeria.\n\n______________________\n\nMr. Leo Atakpu, a Civil Society activist writes from Benin City, Edo State.\n\n...",

Today, Thursday 9th September, 2021, a Caretaker Committee of the Council was inaugurated to pilot the affairs of the Council pending when it would be able to bring all parties together for a proper election to usher in a substantive State Working Committee for the Council.\n\nCarrying out the function of the inauguration, a 3- Man Committee made up of the National Trustee of Zone F, Comrade John Angese, Edo Council Chairman, Comrade Roland Osakue and Delta Council Secretary, Comrade Patrick Ochei effected the orders of the National Secretariat by duly constituting the Caretaker Committee with Comrade Amaechi Okonkwo of the Federated Correspondents\u2019 Chapel as Chairman and Comrade Justice Ihunwo of the Rivers State Television Chapel as the Secretary respectively.\n\nIt was a tug of war as the outgone Chairman and Secretary, Stanley Job and Ike Wigodo unleashed thugs from their camp on the delegated officers, whereby Edo Council Chairman was punched severally in an attempt to screen the SEC members who had filed out for inauguration.\n\nHowever, with the assistance of the Police and DSS officers mobilized to provide security based on the urging of Radio Rivers Chapel Chairman (the Chapel of Comrade Stanley Job), we were able to leave the NUJ Press Centre to Radio Rivers where the inauguration took place.\n\nBriefing the newsmen after the inauguration, the leader of the three man delegation, John Angese said there can never be a vacuum in any leadership position of NUJ, adding that the tenure of Stanley Job\u2019s Exco had expired since June and he should constitutionally vacate office rather than putting up a show to remain in office.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has charged the newly recruited personnel into the state\u2019s civil and public service to be dedicated and committed in the discharge of their duties, contributing significantly to the realization of the government\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda.\n\nObaseki gave the charge while delivering closing remarks at the closing ceremony for the on-boarding programme for the new workers employed into the Edo State Civil and Public Service, at the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Centre, in Benin City.\n\nThe programme, which lasted for four weeks, was for the on-boarding of the first batch of over 300 new recruits into the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nObaseki noted: \u201cToday, we are completing the on-boarding session for the first set of newly appointed public and civil servants. The 300 of you are the first set because of the limitations of resources. We also want to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in the training.\u201d\n\nThe governor disclosed that the vision of his administration is to ensure that 2,000 persons are employed into the service before the end of his tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe focus and plan of my administration is to recruit 2,000 into the Edo State Civil and Public Service before the end of my term as Governor of Edo State on November 12th, 2024. This will be a major transformation of the civil and public service in the State.\n\n\u201cThe public service is broken both at the state and federal levels, and not providing the services required for the people of this nation. This is why things are not going the way they should. We embarked on rebuilding the service to make things work in Edo State and Nigeria. For things to work the way they should, the civil service should function properly.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who assured the new workers of his administration\u2019s support, stated: \u201cWhatever we have built in this administration will continue by the time we leave office on November 12th, 2024. Until we settle the civil and public service as the engine room of government, government will not work.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou are all hired by your efforts and merit as no one had a hand in your employment. I urge you to be fearless in carrying out your responsibilities in your various offices. You owe your employment to nobody as nobody brought you in here; but God made it possible, and the need to deliver services to Edo people.\n\n\u201cYou must be fearless in carrying out your duties and responsibilities. No one can wake up and sack you. Just continue to do the right thing and deliver service to Edo people. The governor didn\u2019t give you the job, nor was it anyone that influenced your recruitment in the service, but your personal efforts and the help of God.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cI am one of those who believe that the remuneration and compensation paid to the public and civil servants are not enough. It is something we need to work on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the end of my tenure, we will break away from the federal remuneration structure and look for a way to pay realistic wages to public and civil servants. If you are hiring the best into the service, as we are doing today, we must compete with other sectors. To do this, good wages must be paid to keep the best in the service.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa said, \u201cthe employment process is based on merit, as no one influenced the employment of those that were employed. The new employees are the best and I see quality in them. The state will benefit from these people.\u201d\n\n...",

On Friday, at least 299 of the 334 cases reported were from the state capital, Melbourne, and surrounding areas.\n\nMultiple campaigners and asylum seekers have told Al Jazeera at least two guards have tested positive and dozens more were presumed to be in quarantine because they had not reported for work in recent days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Australian Border Force (ABF), however, said only one staff member has been confirmed to have the disease. The individual is a contracted service provider at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (MITA) Broadmeadows Residential Precinct (BRP), and \u201cdoes not have contact with detainees as part of their role\u201d, the ABF told Al Jazeera.\n\nA MITA detainee, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, expressed fears for their health and safety, saying that as many as five people were living together in some rooms in the facility, which is divided into several different areas.\n\nThe units in the BRP, which have up to four bedrooms attached to a small kitchenette, are fairly spacious. By contrast, the rooms in Avon, another compound, house up to six people on bunk beds.\n\nHe said while the ABF has provided detainees with masks and sanitiser, it has not carried out widespread testing for the virus.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t test us for COVID-19 unless we show symptoms,\u201d the detainee said. \u201cThis means they would not actually know if it is spreading until a lot of people are sick. It could travel fast. Guards are free to come and go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe private firm which provides staff to the detention facility referred Al Jazeera\u2019s questions to the ABF.\n\nThe ABF said the health and safety of detainees and staff was a priority and that it had worked with the state health department on \u201cstringent\u201d COVID-19 protection measures since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is untrue that infection prevention measures have been lax or minimal within immigration detention facilities,\u201d the ABF said.\n\nPrisons and detention centres around the world have become notorious as hotspots for COVID-19 infection with some countries releasing some of those held to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has described COVID-19 as a \u201cserious threat\u201d for the 1,492 people held in Australia\u2019s immigration detention network.\n\nIn a report in June, the commission said the government should place those who \u201cpresent a low security risk in community-based alternatives to closed detention\u201d.\n\nIt also said authorities should improve physical distancing at the detention facilities and give special attention to the dozens identified as particularly vulnerable to the disease as a result of underlying health conditions.\n\nSome 239 people are being held in MITA, in what campaigners have described as \u201ccrowded\u201d conditions.",

          "text": "Campaigners in Australia are urging the government to release asylum seekers held in immigration detention after at least one COVID-19 case was officially confirmed at a facility in Melbourne.\n\nMelbourne, Australia\u2019s second-largest city, is currently in its sixth lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak driven by the highly infectious Delta variant.\n\nOn Saturday, the state of Victoria reported 450 new cases. On Friday, at least 299 of the 334 cases reported were from the state capital, Melbourne, and surrounding areas.\n\nMultiple campaigners and asylum seekers have told Al Jazeera at least two guards have tested positive and dozens more were presumed to be in quarantine because they had not reported for work in recent days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Australian Border Force (ABF), however, said only one staff member has been confirmed to have the disease. The individual is a contracted service provider at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (MITA) Broadmeadows Residential Precinct (BRP), and \u201cdoes not have contact with detainees as part of their role\u201d, the ABF told Al Jazeera.\n\nA MITA detainee, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, expressed fears for their health and safety, saying that as many as five people were living together in some rooms in the facility, which is divided into several different areas.\n\nThe units in the BRP, which have up to four bedrooms attached to a small kitchenette, are fairly spacious. By contrast, the rooms in Avon, another compound, house up to six people on bunk beds.\n\nHe said while the ABF has provided detainees with masks and sanitiser, it has not carried out widespread testing for the virus.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t test us for COVID-19 unless we show symptoms,\u201d the detainee said. \u201cThis means they would not actually know if it is spreading until a lot of people are sick. It could travel fast. Guards are free to come and go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe private firm which provides staff to the detention facility referred Al Jazeera\u2019s questions to the ABF.\n\nThe ABF said the health and safety of detainees and staff was a priority and that it had worked with the state health department on \u201cstringent\u201d COVID-19 protection measures since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is untrue that infection prevention measures have been lax or minimal within immigration detention facilities,\u201d the ABF said.\n\nPrisons and detention centres around the world have become notorious as hotspots for COVID-19 infection with some countries releasing some of those held to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has described COVID-19 as a \u201cserious threat\u201d for the 1,492 people held in Australia\u2019s immigration detention network.\n\nIn a report in June, the commission said the government should place those who \u201cpresent a low security risk in community-based alternatives to closed detention\u201d.\n\nIt also said authorities should improve physical distancing at the detention facilities and give special attention to the dozens identified as particularly vulnerable to the disease as a result of underlying health conditions.\n\nSome 239 people are being held in MITA, in what campaigners have described as \u201ccrowded\u201d conditions.",

          "text": "A recently evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Boma Akpore, has said that upon leaving the competition last Sunday, he got a lot of hate from Nigerians. According to him, he had to be spirited out of his hotel by 2am to escape people who had laid siege on him.\n\nHe told Sunday Scoop, \u201cSome people have been calling my family members to threaten me. When I first got out of the house, it was 100 per cent hatred (for me). But now, people are starting to show me love. I didn\u2019t have sex with Tega. I kissed and romanced (sic) but there was no penetration. I learnt that there were over 500 people waiting for me at the office (MultiChoice). It was really dangerous for me outside. Because of that, I had to be moved to my hotel around 2am in the morning. I was told I got over 10,000 hate comments, and two members of my team were already hospitalised because they felt down reading all the negative things about me.\u201d\n\nHe also insisted that he did not have sex with a married housemate, Tega, contrary to what went viral on the Internet. He said, \u201cThere was no affair between me and Tega. It was all games. The only reason I feel somehow about it is because I\u2019m now outside the house and I\u2019ve seen how people took it. But, when I was doing it, that was not my intention. We were just going with the flow. I\u2019m an actor and I\u2019ve done the same things; even more, on movie sets. Some people say but BBN was not a movie set, but cameras were permanently on us. I have apologised to all the people that were angered by my actions, and I have moved on. Anybody who wants to stay in the past should stay there. I have been in the entertainment industry and I\u2019ve grown a thick skin. Now, I\u2019m not even apologising to anybody anymore. They went too far when they involved my family. When I saw my mum crying, I resolved that I owed nobody any explanation.\u201d\n\nBoma also insisted that he never told Pere that Tega\u2019s private part smelt like fish. Some people don\u2019t watch the show but rely on information from blogs and other social media platforms.\n\nStating his own side of the story about the quarrel between him and Angel, the actor said, \u201cI had asked her why she insinuated that I was a kiss-and-tell person. I told her that could go wrong as there were millions of people watching the show. I told her that she shouldn\u2019t say things like that and that we should settle it. I believe in quenching fires. She then used a curse word on me repeatedly and that\u2019s when I exploded. I am not saying I was right for reacting that way but we are humans and we react in different ways. The incident was blown out of proportion and I wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that route. I later apologised to her and even hugged her when I was leaving the house.\u201d\n\nExplaining what transpired between him and Maria on a particular night that they got into an argument, Boma said, \u201cWe were in the room and she told me to stop making a noise because she wanted to sleep. I told her she could sleep as I wasn\u2019t making a noise, I was just talking to one person. She then said we should leave the room. I had to let her know that she was not in a hotel and she couldn\u2019t dictate where people should be. I was practically whispering to the person I was having a conversation with. It seemed she (Maria) was in a bad mood that day and I told her not to transfer the aggression to me. However, we spoke about it some days after and sorted it out.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would return to the United States of America or stay back in Nigeria, he retorted, \u201cStay here and do what? I can only go back and forth; I cannot stay here. I am a member of the screen actors guild in the US and I have a bright future there.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that his escapades in the house would not affect his brand negatively, Boma said, \u201cI just signed an international deal which is really big. I am also in some negotiations and they are waiting for me to accept them or decline.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that \u2018except her family objects\u2019, he intended to \u2018continue being friends with Tega\u2019.

          "text": "Mr Gumi claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to deploy military against violent criminals thwarted his efforts to obtain amnesty for bandits and killer herders.\n\nA composite of Buhari, Bandits and Gumi used to illustrate this story\n\nIslamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi on Friday called for the establishment of a federal ministry to address the grievances of bandits and killer Fulani herders terrorising the country.\n\nMr Gumi, a self-appointed intermediary in the ongoing crises of banditry and killer herdsmen, said in a Facebook post on Friday that bandits should be rehabilitated like Niger Delta militants, adding that declaring war against bandits would be futile.\n\n\u201cSome said we have tried amnesty but it didn\u2019t work. You didn\u2019t try amnesty but tried amnesia. Amnesty without rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation is no amnesty,\u201d Mr Gumi said. \u201cAsk the former Niger Delta Militants who killed security men in the past what an amnesty is. What stops us from having a federal ministry of Nomadic Affairs where their grievances and complaints will be addressed?\u201d\n\nPresident Umar Yar\u2019Adua implemented an amnesty policy that saw the rehabilitation of thousands of Niger Delta militants who had waged a decade-long war on oil facilities across the region. The militants lamented economic deprivation and environmental degradation that assailed the oil-rich region, drawing both sympathy and condemnation from different segments of the society.\n\nThe militants accepted political and economic solutions, including the creation of a Niger Delta ministry, proposed by the Yar\u2019Adua administration and relinquished their arms and ammunition, marking an end of hostilities that saw the destruction of oil installations and deadly attacks on local and expatriate oil workers.\n\nMr Gumi\u2019s statement came days after Katsina Governor Aminu Masari openly admitted that Fulanis are the bandits and herders responsible for the widespread killing and abduction across the country.\n\nMr Gumi said his efforts to get amnesty for bandits and killer herdsmen have been sabotaged by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to deploy troops against violent criminals.\n\n\u201cSome disingenuous people say: peace and negotiations with herdsmen bandits have failed, and your mission has failed! I said my mission has not failed but it was sabotaged or discouraged by the same influential people that benefit from the chaos or like us to destroy ourselves and leave the herdsmen in perpetual ignorance,\u201d Mr Gumi said.\n\nIn the Facebook post, Mr Gumi also slammed presidential spokesman Femi Adesina for mocking him as a bandit lover for his open support alliance with the bandits, who have been responsible for widespread killing, destruction and mass abduction of citizens, including schoolchildren.\n\n\u201cYou bootlicker that called me a bandit-lover! I am not one, but my country-lover, my region-lover, my state-lover, and my people-lover, and humanity-lover,\u201d Mr Gumi said to Mr Adesina without naming him.\n\nIt was unclear whether or not Mr Buhari was weighing amnesty for bandits as a sustainable solution to the acute insecurity that threatens to define his legacy. A State House spokesman did not return a request for comment on Saturday morning.\n\nRead Mr Gumi\u2019s full statement below;\n\nWAR HAS NEVER BEEN A SOLUTION ANYWHERE ANYTIME\n\nYou bootlicker that called me a bandit-lover! I am not one, but my country-lover, my region-lover, my state-lover, and my people-lover, and humanity-lover.\n\nI am a qualified Medical Doctor who knows what it takes to precisely excise a brain tumour without destroying the delicate surrounding brain tissues. I was a commissioned military officer who knows what the military is for and what is the capability of our military. I am an intellectual with a Ph.D. from Abroad. I am an Islamic scholar who knows the immorality of killing innocent lives. So, silence for me in this ocean of oblivion is not an option.\n\nOnly a fool would allow his dwelling to be a theatre of war. Unfortunately, how many fools are there. Killing rats in your rat-infested sitting room with an iron rod will only end up destroying your gadgets and furniture probably without killing any. We should not mask out poor governance with artillery power.\n\nSome disingenuous people say: peace and negotiations with herdsmen bandits have failed, and your mission has failed!\n\nI said my mission has not failed but it was sabotaged or discouraged by the same influential people that benefit from the chaos or like us to destroy ourselves and leave the herdsmen in perpetual ignorance.\n\nSome said we have tried amnesty but it didn\u2019t work. You didn\u2019t try amnesty but tried amnesia. Amnesty without rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation is no amnesty. Ask the former Niger Delta Militants who killed security men in the past what an amnesty is. What stops us from having a federal ministry of Nomadic Affairs where their grievances and complaints will be addressed?\n\nAll the bandit leaders we saw complained of how some repentant ones were picked and extra-judicially killed after the surrender of their weapons. Without their trust of the very unjust system all Nigerians complain of, which they took arms to fight, peace and negotiations with them will not work. This brings our role of mediation. They know as religious men we will not deceive them, and they came out in troops to meet us. To our astonishment, it is the same unjust system that turns round to betray our peace mission. Some of the press for giving a negative narrative, whom I also term criminals-in-purpose, some of the politicians who I see as urban-bandits who out of their share mismanagement of our meagre resources and misplacement of priority cause the death and infirmity of more people than the bandits affect.\n\nOf recent, how many Nigerians die of cholera -a water-born disease- because of lack of simple clean water to drink, or typhoid, malaria, and malnutrition? A nation with a maternal mortality rate of almost 500000/annum because of the lack of adequate maternal health facilities and qualified staff. A country where its highly-priced medical personnel is looking for a window to escape the inferno. Such a country, please!\n\nBy the way, what you may not hear, is that the bandits over the years have developed escape routes from aerial bombardments. They told us: you can only kill our women and children with your attacks!\n\nJust yesterday, two contingents of banditry victims came to me that their loved ones were abducted by bandits in Kaduna suburbs \u2013 Rigachukun and Keke. An escapee engineer in the later said, when he overheard and understood that they were strangers in the area as they were calling the locals to lead them, that gave him the courage to slip through densely grown maize plantations to escape. The point is that, if Zamfara is on fire for them, definitely it goes without saying that they will migrate to other areas. So, is the whole of Nigeria going to be under lock-up in incommunicado?\n\nAs for the economic impact of the areas now under siege, it\u2019s just a matter of time, you\u2019ll hear them crying out. Already yesterday a man from Tsafe came begging because of economic stagnation, one would have thought that Gusau the capital is closer than Kaduna to beg.\n\nAs for those cynics that have no value to add in the dilemma except vituperation, and abuses, we know that is the substance they are made up of. No qualms whatsoever! you don\u2019t expect fragrance from faeces.\n\nSo, what is the solution?\n\nGood Intelligence! Good proficient policing, engagement of the local herdsmen in policing, rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation of all victims of banditry. The good honest judiciary protects people\u2019s rights. Money and time well spent on these will surely kill the disease and heal the nation of this delinquency, crimes, and bad governance.\n\nOh Allah! on Your Mercy we depend. GUMI.",

It will be on 17th September, Court Room No 4, Federal High Court Abuja, behind the Federal Ministry of Justice. Time: 10am.\u201d\n\nThe court hearing comes six months after a letter written by the Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABDON) requested that those who are being detained by the Department of State Services be admitted on bail, pending the conclusion of the investigation.\n\nThe source who spoke to SaharaReporters said the court first sat on the 18th of August but the DSS refused to come to court with the defendants.\n\nHe said the lawyers of the operators requested that his clients appear in court during the next sitting which was on September 2.\n\nHowever, the hearing could not hold due to the ailing health of the presiding judge. The defendants, it was gathered, were not brought to the court.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe association of bureau de change operators hired a barrister for their members. They went for a court sitting and the barrister wanted the DSS to bring his clients for the next sitting.\n\n\u201cThe judge asked the DSS to bring the clients. But even during the second court sitting, the operators were absent. The DSS asked the judge to give them extra days but he said no that they already had enough time to carry out an investigation.\n\n\u201cThe hearing was scheduled for September 2 again but the DSS did not come to the court with the operators and the judge was not feeling well so it was rescheduled again.\u201d\n\nIn March, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the Nigerian government arrested the Bureau De Change operators who were facilitating the transfer of money to Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nHe had said some Nigerians transferring money to the sect from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were working with the BDC operators.\n\n\u201cBureaus de change are facilitating money to terrorists. We have already worked with the UAE. Convictions have been achieved of Nigerians who are transferring money to Boko Haram terrorists and this also happens domestically. And I tell you that by the time we finish this investigation, the shocking details will surprise many Nigerians,\u201d Shehu had said.\n\nDozens of persons have been arrested by security agents in an ongoing nationwide crackdown on suspected financiers and collaborators of Boko Haram.\n\nThose arrested are being kept in military and DSS facilities in Abuja and other places.\n\nMultiple sources said the closely guarded operation is being coordinated by Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), in collaboration with the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).",

Hassan Kuraye, condemned the unguided utterances about Governor Masari by their National Secretary, would necessitate the National Chairman and executive members to visit Katsina to seek for Governor\u2019s forgiveness over the derogatory remarks.\n\nAt a press briefing held at the NUJ Secretariat on Friday, the state chairman condemned the unguarded derogatory statement of the National Secretary, saying it does not in any way reflect the view of the association at both the national and state chapter.\n\n\u201cWe request to have your indulgence this morning to make some issues clear as far as the relationship between Miyetti Allah Hore and the Katsina Government is concerned.\n\n\u201cOne of us, the national secretary of Miyetti Allah, cattle Hore, Alhassan Saleh, made some negative utterances against His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, which were found so heavy to the entire Fulani race across the landscape of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe National Secretariat of Miyetti Allah Hore has already distanced itself from those negative utterances made by Alhassan Saleh, and we felt it is imperative for us as the state chapter of the Miyetti Allah Hore to align ourselves with the National Secretariat of our noble union and distance ourselves equally.\n\n\u201cAs such, we felt it will be important for us to make ourselves clear on those utterances. He made the utterances on his own,, and he is standing alone as far as we are concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has shown some signs of remorse when he was contacted by the national chairman,\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, please forgive and forget those utterances because we are law-abiding citizens of this country. Miyetti Allah cattle Hore is a registered and law-abiding association.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of Miyetti Allah Hore is coming to Katsina personally with his Executives to plead with His Excellency to forgive and forget those negative utterances for us to continue to forge ahead, to continue to make some progress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot complete this press briefing without noticing some contribution made by His Excellency. Already you are aware that there\u2019s a standing committee for the relationship between herders and farmers in Katsina State, which is making a very comprehensive and very successful negotiation with the farmers where we have some cattle routes being encroached, and already they have been demarcated by the standing committee with the support of Katsina State Government.\n\nIn a nutshell, we are here to say that the utterances made by our national secretary are not good.\n\nAt least by the age of His Excellency and the position he is occupying, he deserves some respect so that the successes we have been recording, from the inception of this administration will continue to thrive.\n\nRecalled Alhassan Saleh recently granted an interview to Sahara Reporters to elicit his reactions on a recent interview Governor Masari granted to Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today\u2019 programme where the Governor stated that many of the bandits terrorizing the North are from Fulani extraction involved in cattle rearing,\n\nIn his response, Saleh painted the Katsina Governor in derogatory terms for daring to label the Fulani as being primarily responsible for banditry in the North.\n\nThe National Secretary, while urging Nigerians to ignore Masari\u2019s statement, throwing caution into the air, described Governor Masari as a confused drunkard.\n\n\u201cDid you take that drunkard serious? My governor, do you take him seriously? Can\u2019t you see that he is already tired? Records should come from security operatives, not confused human beings.\n\n\u201cAll of them talking, they are stealing security votes, they should find solutions, create ranches for these herders and accommodate them.\n\n\u201cWhich people do you find along the Sahel Sahara desert? They are many tribes, is it by a physique that you now identify a Fulani man? The bandits are criminals, why should you attach a tribe to it? That\u2019s why we are not happy. You don\u2019t need to attach a tribe because it will affect an innocent person.\n\n\u201cForget that man, that man is the worst Governor Katsina has had; we are just praying for his time to lapse.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Katsina State chapter Chairman of Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye said that the National Secretary has since regretted his actions.",

          "text": "Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu has said the comprehensive approach to resolving current Nigeria\u2019s challenges is through confronting adult illiteracy and paying attention to out of school children.\n\nDisclosing this at the 2021 International Literacy Day, ILD, held in Abuja on Tuesday, Adamu said the Nigerian government is determined to confront the adult literacy programmes with the same zeal it is handling out of school children.\n\nHe said developing, sustaining and enhancing literacy skills is a lifelong and community-wide endeavour, requiring a strong commitment from the society as a whole.\n\nThe Minister said Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 calls on countries to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u2019. Specifically, SDG Target 4.6 requires that by 2030, member states should ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, it is estimated that over 6.9 million children are out of school.\n\nThis is in addition to the estimated 38% of non literate adult Population. Investing in Education of the parents will have ripple effect on the reduction of out of school Children.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that non-literate parents are more likely to breed out of school children, thereby compounding the phenomenon facing our nation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile flagging off the national activities to commemorate the 2021\n\nInternational Literacy Day, Adamu urged all stakeholders, including the journalists, to make a difference by complementing government\u2019s efforts in the fight against illiteracy in our various schedules, homes, families and immediate communities.\n\nAdamu commended Director General of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation,UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay and her staff for their continued support in coordinating wide-ranging technical and financial assistance of the UN system, donor countries and the private sector, in country-level implementation of initiatives and programmes aimed at reducing the scourge of illiteracy worldwide.\n\nAlso, speaking the UNESCO Representative, Mammadou Lamine Sow said the COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst disturbance to education and training systems in a century, with the longest school closures affecting more than 1.6 billion learners at its peak time.\n\nHe quoted the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) by November 2020, which said the average child had lost 54 percent of a year\u2019s contact time, which could be interpreted as the loss of over a year\u2019s learning if the time of forgetting what was previously acquired is counted.\n\nHe said \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the fragility of many youth and adult literacy programmes, systems and policies as represented by the abrupt suspension of numerous programmes.

          "text": "The forensic team that presented its report to the Lagos State Judicial Panel on Friday said the integrity of the scene of the Lekki Toll Gate shooting had been compromised long before forensic investigations.\n\nManaging Director of Sentinel Forensics Limited, Mr Joseph Funsho-Ako, explained that the compromise was because the team visited the toll gate, 87 days after the October 20, 2020 incident.\n\nHe added that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) had even carried out a clean-up of the area before the visit by the forensic team.\n\nREAD ALSO: No More Amnesty For Bandits In Zamfara, Says Matawalle\n\nFunsho-Ako spoke about the incident in a testimony when he appeared on Saturday before the Lagos Judicial Panel on restitution for victims of SARS-related abuses and other matters.\n\nHe later answered questions under cross-examination from the counsel to the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Bernard Onigah.\n\nIn the process, he explained that based on the information that the area had been cleaned up earlier, his firm called LAWMA, requesting information that could help with its forensic investigations, but they did not get any response.\n\nOn the ballistic evidence, he affirmed that the live ammunition presented by the Nigerian Army was of the same calibre as the cartridge casing submitted by the panel.\n\nBut the witness stressed the need for further analysis, to determine whether the expended live ammunition casings were fired by the army.\n\nAs at the time of this report, the forensic expert was being cross-examined by different lawyers at the panel.\n\nSaturday\u2019s session is the 123rd sitting of the panel following the hearing of the petitions of various victims of police abuse, during which some were awarded varying sums as compensation.\n\nThe focus at the latest proceeding was the long-awaited forensic report for the Lekki Tollgate Shooting which sparked widespread condemnation within and outside the country.\n\nSentinel Forensics Limited was engaged by the Lagos State government on December 29, 2020, to conduct a forensic review of the unfortunate incident that occurred about two months earlier.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mandate required it to conduct a crime scene investigation at the toll plaza, submit a detailed report on the investigation, and examine the CCTV footage of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC), among other things.\n\nIt was also asked to give a digital forensic expert opinion on the recording of incidents on the day of the shooting, provide an expert opinion on any evidence recovered during the scene visit by panel members, as well as submit a detailed comprehensive forensic report on the subject.\n\nArmy Not Indicted\n\nMeanwhile, Funsho-Ako has refuted what he described as \u201cfalse publications\u201d on the testimony his firm gave before the panel on Friday.\n\nHe faulted the reports suggesting that his team\u2019s findings indicted the Nigerian Army in the shooting of peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in October 2020.\n\n\u201cThis biased and unbalanced reporting is false and fake news,\u201d said the witness. \u201cOur forensic specialist commented on record that following an extensive scene investigation at the Lekki Toll Plaza (TP1) by our team of specialists, about 87 days after the incident, there was an absence of any physical evidence supporting the allegations of discharge of live ammunition by Nigerian Army personnel.\n\n\u201cThis scene investigation was conducted days after Sentinel Forensics Limited was engaged by the judicial panel of inquiry.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the ballistic evidence presented to the specialists for forensic examination by the panel, they found that two cartridge casings (expended/fired) of 7.62 x 39mm ammunition was tendered by the judicial panel as evidence recovered at the scene, while one unit of live (unexpended/not fired) ammunition and one unit of cartridge case (expended/fired round) 7.62 x 39mm ammunition was tendered by the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe Nigerian Army was also said to have tendered a unit of blank (unexpended/not fired) 7.62 x 51mm ammunition and a unit of blank (expended/fired round) 7.62 x 51mm ammunition.\n\nThe witness had told the panel on Friday, among other things, that the live ammunition tendered as exhibit by the Nigerian Army was of the same type of cartridge and calibre as the ammunition casings tendered by the judicial panel which was 7.62 x 39mm.\n\nHe added that the blank ammunition tendered was of a different cartridge type 7.62mm x 51mm.\n\nThe firm had also released a statement and its representative stressed this position on Saturday, at the resumed hearing, saying their job was not to ascribe guilt or innocence on anyone, but only to provide clarification to help the panel reach its decision on the matter.\n\nIn her reaction, the chairperson of the judicial panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, asked the media to be professional and responsible in its reportage of the public hearing.",

          "text": "Emma Raducanu ended Britain\u2019s 44-year wait for a women\u2019s Grand Slam singles champion as she beat Leylah Fernandez to win the US Open in the most thrilling style.\n\nThe 18-year-old ended her scarcely believable run in New York with a 6-4 6-3 win over her 19-year-old Canadian opponent in a high-quality final.\n\nRaducanu threw herself to the floor in disbelief as she fired down an ace to conclude what has been the most remarkable journey.\n\nRaducanu served for the match at 5-3 but cut her leg as she went break point down, leading to a medical time-out and a clearly irritated Fernandez expressing her frustration to the match official.\n\nHowever, Raducanu shrugged off the delay, saving a further break point before closing out her third championship point.\n\nThe two shared a warm hug before Raducanu headed up the stairs at Arthur Ashe Stadium to celebrate with her support box.\n\nRaducanu was cheered on by an emotional Virginia Wade, who was the last British woman to win a major trophy at Wimbledon in 1977.\n\n\u201cIt means so much to have Virginia Wade here and also Tim Henman,\u201d Raducanu said in her on-court speech.\n\n\u201cThey are British icons and for me to follow in their footsteps gave me the belief I could do it.\u201d\n\nWith the victory, Raducanu becomes:\n\nThe first British female winner at Flushing Meadows since Virginia Wade in 1968\n\nThe first qualifier in the Open era to win a Slam\n\nThe youngest women\u2019s Slam champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004\n\nThe youngest Briton to win a Grand Slam title\n\nThe first woman to win the US Open without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014\n\nShe will take home \u00a31.8m in prize money, rise to 23 in the world rankings and will become the British number one on Monday.\n\nRaducanu will also know that she has starred in one of the biggest moments in British sporting history \u2013 and captured the imagination of the fans at home and in New York.\n\nAstonishing. Ridiculous. Meteoric. Unbelievable. Take your pick \u2013 but no word can ever really sum up what Raducanu has achieved.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Raducanu had a flight booked back to the UK, just in case she did not come through qualifying in New York. Seventeen days later, she has lifted the trophy in front of a rapturous crowd.\n\nRaducanu did not just come through qualifying: she dominated it. The most games she lost in one set in her entire run in New York \u2013 five \u2013 came in the second round of qualifying.\n\nIt is not just that Raducanu has kept on winning, but she has done it with such dominance. She did not drop a set en route to the final, despite meeting Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and in-form Maria Sakkari on the way.\n\nIn the big moments, she has held her nerve, trusting in her power and serve, even when she saw two championship points go by in the final.\n\nThis is someone who, two months ago, was collecting her A-Level results. She only made her WTA main-draw debut in June. All this has happened so quickly, and yet not once has Raducanu not looked like she belongs.\n\nWith all the attention on Raducanu after Wimbledon \u2013 as well as questions from some about her mental toughness \u2013 she could have easily been overwhelmed.\n\nInstead, she trusted in herself, hired a new coach in Andrew Richardson and went to America to play in the various events.\n\nNo-one could have seen this coming; not the ease with which Raducanu would brush her opponents aside, or the calmness with which she would approach every match.\n\nBut Raducanu always believed. And she will leave New York as the US Open champion.\n\n\u2018An almost perfect performance\u2019 \u2013 analysis\n\nFormer British number one Laura Robson on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThere are so many sliding doors moments. Before Wimbledon, Emma didn\u2019t have a main draw wild card. Would she be in this position if they hadn\u2019t upgraded it? Would this happen if she hadn\u2019t had to retire from the fourth round with breathing problems?\n\n\u201cShe played an almost perfect performance in her first Grand Slam final. You have to think there will be so many more.\u201d\n\nFormer Wimbledon champion Pat Cash: \u201cI cannot believe it. It is unheard of for a qualifier to win the US Open. Goran Ivanisevic won Wimbledon as a wildcard but he had already been to Wimbledon finals, not playing a second Grand Slam.\n\n\u201cShe hits so cleanly. I cannot come up with a reason for this to happen. It does not make sense at all. Her performance is mindboggling.\u201d\n\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: \u201cI have never seen anything like this and I suspect if I work in this business for another 20 years I won\u2019t see anything like it.\u201d\n\nA full Arthur Ashe Stadium \u2013 which holds almost 24,000 people \u2013 is one of the most intimidating sights in tennis, but neither player looked fazed as they walked out on to the biggest stage of their career.\n\nFernandez had more of the crowd support, given that she has ousted the second, third and fifth seed in New York, but there was still good support for Raducanu.\n\nThe first three games lasted for 23 minutes, both players showing a devastating array of cross-court punches and fiery returns of serve, and they traded breaks as they found their footing.\n\nAs she has done throughout the tournament, Raducanu dug herself out from 0-30 down several times, stepping forward, playing more aggressively and finding her first serves.\n\nThat gave her the confidence to attack Fernandez\u2019s second serve and put herself on top. She closed out the first set with a forehand down the line, turning and pumping her fist towards her box before letting out a yell of \u201ccome on!\u201d to the crowd as they rose to applaud.\n\nFernandez has shown tenacity throughout the tournament and she did so here, saving three break points in her first service game to stop Raducanu taking a 2-0 lead in the second.\n\nShe then found the break, adjusting to hit Raducanu\u2019s serves better, and it looked as though the momentum had swung the way of the young Canadian.\n\nHowever, there is a reason Raducanu has not dropped a set in New York. At the changeover she sat quietly, eyes closed, before again increasing her tempo and creating the break opportunity.\n\nShe broke with the shot of the match \u2013 a stunning forehand pass, made from almost off the court, that left Fernandez stranded at the net.\n\nTwo championship points came and went on the Fernandez serve, saved once again by brave hitting, but Raducanu did not falter despite taking a nasty cut to the leg as she slid behind the baseline.\n\nIt was an odd interlude in what was an entertaining final that proved that the future of women\u2019s tennis is bright.",

          "text": "Tunisia\u2019s President Kais Saied has indicated plans to change the country\u2019s constitution, seven weeks after he seized power in moves his opponents called a coup.\n\nThe comments on Saturday represented Saied\u2019s clearest statement yet about what he intends to do next, having sworn there was \u201cno going back\u201d to the situation in the North African nation before his intervention on July 25.\n\nSpeaking live on television in a central Tunis boulevard, Saied said he respected the 2014 democratic constitution but that it was \u201cnot eternal\u201d and could be amended.\n\n\u201cAmendments must be made within the framework of the constitution,\u201d he told the Sky News Arabia channel and Tunisian state television.\n\nOne of Saied\u2019s advisers told Reuters news agency on Thursday the president was planning to suspend the constitution and offer an amended version via a referendum, prompting opposition from political parties and the powerful UGTT labour union.\n\nAnxiety has been growing, both internally and among Western democracies that have supported Tunisia\u2019s public finances, over Saied\u2019s intentions since his July 25 announcement that he was sacking the prime minister and suspending parliament.\n\nThe former constitutional law professor justified those moves by citing emergency measures in the constitution that his critics and many legal scholars said did not support his intervention. Though he indefinitely extended the measures after a month, he has yet to appoint a new government or make any clear declaration of his long-term intentions, as Tunisia struggles to confront a rolling economic crisis.\n\nSaied on Saturday pledged again to form a new government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after selecting \u201cthe people with the most integrity\u201d.\n\nHe declined to give a specific timeline, however.\n\nSaied\u2019s intervention drew widespread support after years of political paralysis, but it has thrust Tunisia into crisis a decade after it threw off dictatorship and embraced democracy in the revolution that triggered the Arab Spring.\n\nPolitical leaders have complained about the constitution since it was agreed in 2014, calling for it to be changed to either a more directly presidential, or a more directly parliamentary, system.\n\nArticle 144 of the constitution says an amendment to the document can only be put to a referendum if it has already been approved by two-thirds of the parliament, an institution Saied last month called \u201ca danger to the state\u201d.\n\nThe current parliament was elected in 2019, a week after Saied was elected. He does not have the power to dissolve it and call new elections, but some of the parties in the deeply fragmented chamber have indicated they could do so themselves.\n\nThe moderate Islamist Ennahdha, the biggest party in parliament with a quarter of the seats, has accused Saied of carrying out a coup and on Saturday said deviating from the constitution would mean a retreat from democracy.\n\nThe UGTT, the main labour union in Tunisia, also signalled on Saturday it opposed the idea of suspending the constitution and called instead for new parliamentary elections.\n\nMeanwhile ambassadors from the Group of Seven advanced economies last week urged the Tunisian president to quickly form a government and return to \u201ca constitutional order, in which an elected parliament plays a significant role\u201d.",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s government says more than 50% of the population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nJapan\u2019s vaccine rollouts began in mid-February, months behind many wealthy countries due to its lengthy clinical testing requirement and approval process. Inoculations for elderly patients, which started in April, were also slowed by supply shortages of imported vaccines, but the pace picked up in late May and has since achieved 1 million doses per day.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of COVID-19 measures, told NHK public television\u2019s weekly talk show Sunday that about 60% of the population is expected to be fully vaccinated by the end of September, on par with current levels in Europe.\n\nThe government is studying a roadmap for easing restrictions around November when a large majority of the population is expected to be fully vaccinated. That would allow fully vaccinated people and those who test negative to travel, gather for parties or attend mass events.\n\nThe progress of vaccinations has helped reduce serious cases and deaths among older people, but infections from virus variants spread explosively in August among younger generations still largely unvaccinated, severely straining health care systems.\n\nJapan last Friday extended the ongoing state of emergency in Tokyo and 18 other areas until Sept. 30. It had been scheduled to end Sunday. The measures focus on requests for eateries to close early and not serve alcohol.\n\nJapan has done much better than other developed countries in curbing illnesses and deaths without a lockdown.

Most of the lending was focused on the power, transport and mining sectors.",

          "title": "FBI Releases Newly Declassified Record on September 11 Attacks",
          "text": "The FBI late Saturday released a newly declassified document related to logistical support given to two of the Saudi hijackers in the run-up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The document details contacts the hijackers had with Saudi associates in the U.S. but does not provide proof that senior Saudi government officials were complicit in the plot.\n\nReleased on the 20th anniversary of the attacks, the document is the first investigative record to be disclosed since President Joe Biden ordered a declassification review of materials that for years have remained out of public view. The 16-page document is a summary of an FBI interview done in 2015 with a man who had frequent contact with Saudi nationals in the U.S. who supported the first hijackers to arrive in the country before the attacks.\n\nBiden last week ordered the Justice Department and other agencies to conduct a declassification review and release what documents they can over the next six months. He had encountered pressure from victims\u2019 families, who have long sought the records as they pursue a lawsuit in New York alleging that Saudi government officials supported the hijackers.\n\nThe heavily redacted document was disclosed on Saturday night, hours after Biden attended Sept. 11 memorial events in New York, Pennsylvania and northern Virginia. Victims\u2019 relatives had earlier objected to Biden\u2019s presence at ceremonial events as long as the documents remained classified.\n\nThe Saudi government has long denied any involvement in the attacks. The Saudi Embassy in Washington has it supported the full declassification of all records as a way to \u201cend the baseless allegations against the Kingdom once and for all.\u201d The embassy said that any allegation that Saudi Arabia was complicit was \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nThe trove of documents are being released at a politically delicate time for the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, two nations that have forged a strategic \u2014 if difficult \u2014 alliance, particularly on counterterrorism matters. The Biden administration in February released an intelligence assessment implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but drew criticism from Democrats for avoiding a direct punishment of the crown prince himself.\n\nVictims\u2019 relatives cheered the document\u2019s release as a significant step in their effort to connect the attacks to Saudi Arabia. Brett Eagleson, whose father, Bruce, was killed in the World Trade Center attack, said the release of the FBI material \u201caccelerates our pursuit of truth and justice.\u201d\n\nJim Kreindler, a lawyer for the victims\u2019 relatives, said in a statement that \u201cthe findings and conclusions in this FBI investigation validate the arguments we have made in the litigation regarding the Saudi government\u2019s responsibility for the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\u201cThis document, together with the public evidence gathered to date, provides a blueprint for how (al-Qaida) operated inside the US with the active, knowing support of the Saudi government,\u201d he said.\n\nThat includes, he added, Saudi officials exchanging phone calls among themselves and al-Qaida operatives and then having \u201caccidental meetings\u201d with the hijackers while providing them with assistance to get settled and find flight schools.\n\nRegarding Sept. 11, there has been speculation of official involvement since shortly after the attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis. Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida at the time, was from a prominent family in the kingdom.\n\nThe U.S. investigated some Saudi diplomats and others with Saudi government ties who knew hijackers after they arrived in the U.S., according to documents that have already been declassified.\n\nStill, the 9/11 Commission report in 2004 found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d the attacks that al-Qaida masterminded, though it noted Saudi-linked charities could have diverted money to the group.\n\nParticular scrutiny has centered on the first two hijackers to arrive in the U.S., Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar and support they received.\n\nIn February 2000, shortly after their arrival in southern California, they encountered at a halal restaurant a Saudi national named Omar al-Bayoumi who helped them find and lease an apartment in San Diego, had ties to the Saudi government and had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.\n\nBayoumi has described his restaurant meeting with Hazmi and Mihdhar as a \u201cchance encounter,\u201d and the FBI during its interview made multiple attempts to ascertain if that characterization was accurate or if it had actually been arranged in advance, according to the document.\n\nThe 2015 interview that forms the basis of the document was of a man who was applying for U.S. citizenship and who years earlier had repeated contacts with Saudi nationals who investigators said provided \u201csignificant logistical support\u201d to several of the hijackers. Among his contacts was Bayoumi, according to the document.\n\nThe man\u2019s identity is redacted throughout the document, but he is described as having worked at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso referenced in the document is Fahad al-Thumairy, at the time an accredited diplomat at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles who investigators say led an extremist faction at his mosque. The document says communications analysis identified a seven-minute phone call in 1999 from Thumairy\u2019s phone to the Saudi Arabian family home phone of two brothers who became future detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison.\n\nBoth Bayoumi and Thumairy left the U.S. weeks before the attacks.",
