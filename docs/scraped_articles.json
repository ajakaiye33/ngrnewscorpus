One of the victims was gunned down inside the All Progressives Congress (APC) office at Uruagu Ward 3 in Nnewi North Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nThe other three, it was gathered, were killed along Nnobi \u2013 Nnewi Road, near Afor Market, Nnobi, in Idemmili South LGA.

          "title": "Ahead of October Launch, eNaira Platform Goes Live",
          "text": "*Records one million hits in days after unveiling according to analytics\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe official website of the upcoming Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) digital currency, the eNaira, has gone live, exactly one week to the planned launch of the initiative.\n\nRemarkably, 24-hours after the website went live, it has recorded over one million hits, according to analytics monitored by THISDAY.\n\nThe development shows a reflection of the level of interest in the proposed digital currency.\n\nThe website promises easier financial transactions for users of eNaira, offers opportunity for peer-to-peer payments which allows users to send money to one another through a linked bank account or card; allows customers to move money from their bank account to their eNaira wallet with ease; can monitor their eNaira wallet, check balances and view transaction history; and make in-store payment using their eNaira wallet by scanning QR codes.\n\nIn addition, customers are allowed to scan the QR Code on the website to get started.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, while speaking to a gathering of foreign investors in New York, recently, had told his audience that because of activities surrounding the country\u2019s Independence celebration on October 1, the earlier planned launch of the eNaira on same date would likely be rescheduled to October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe central bank would not want the event to take the shine away from the Independence celebration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency. It is a novel idea because we think it will facilitate trade, Nigeria being the biggest economy in Africa, this will set the tone to tell Africa that we are ready to lead and we would indeed lead in trade and we would make sure that happens.\n\n\u201cBetween all central bankers in ECOWAS, we are already working on certain collaboration to make trade, payment and banking system integrate in such a way to set example on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),\u201d he added.\n\nIn line with global trend, the CBN recently took a major step towards the launch of its digital currency with its formal announcement of its engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for the project. To choose the technical partner, the CBN went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the Public Procurement Act, conducted by seven departmental directors and a Deputy Governor whereby several companies were evaluated. The evaluation was based on the following criteria: technology ownership and control; implementation timeline; efficiency, ease of adoption; support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); platform security; interoperability; implementation experience.\n\nEmefiele expressed optimism that the eNaira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow. He said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nAccording to him, after its unveiling, Nigerians should be able to download the eNaira app from either Google plays store or Apple app store, on board themselves and fund their eNaira wallet using their bank account or with cash at a registered agent location.\n\n\u201cIf you are a bank customer and you have say N10 million in your bank account, for your comfort of spending and making purchase, you can tell the bank to load N2 million out of your N10 million into your wallet.\n\n\u201cSo, your bank balance in physical cash drops to N8 million, while your e-wallet carries N2 million. With that you can make purchases both within and across the country.\n\n\u201cThere are so many variance of the eNaira. But this is where we would start because we are not going to pretend that there are not risks in opening your system up. We would look at the various products, determine the risk, determine the best way to mitigate the risk before we now open it up more and more,\u201d Emefiele added.\n\nAlso shedding more light on Bitts, he said, \u201cwe chose them as a partner. In some other climes where they are, they have their software and they earn their money. But we chose that they would establish their company in Nigeria. \u201cThe CBN will own substantially stake in that company. It is a company that will be established in Nigeria and majority holding will be the CBN,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained that the eNaira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017, to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s central bank last weekend announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cVirtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,\u201d the BBC quoted People\u2019s Bank of China to have said, warning it \u201cseriously endangers the safety of people\u2019s assets\u201d. China is one of the world\u2019s largest crypto-currency markets. Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (\u00a31,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement.\n\nIt was the latest in China\u2019s national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best \u2013 and a way to launder money at worst. Trading crypto-currency had officially been banned in China since 2019, but had continued online through foreign exchanges. However, there has been a significant crackdown this year.\n\nIn May, Chinese state intuitions warned buyers they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry.\n\nIn June, it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions and issued bans on \u201cmining\u201d the currencies \u2013 the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ndume condemns killing of soldiers by insurgents in Borno\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nAnother batch of 10 of the remaining 21 abducted students of the Bethel Baptist High School, Damishi, Kaduna, has been released by bandits after 81 days in captivity.\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the 10 students were released on Sunday afternoon and were reunited with their parents.\n\nThis is as a former Senate Leader, Senator Ali Ndume, at the weekend, condemned in strongest terms, the recent killing of some Nigerian soldiers by Boko Haram insurgents in Marte-Dikwa Local Council Area of Borno State.\n\nHowever, while giving an update on the Bethel students kidnap debacle, Hayab expressed hope that the remaining 11 students would soon be released.\n\n\u201cTen more students of Baptist High School were released this afternoon. We have 11 now with bandits. Thanking all Nigerians for their prayers and support. Trusting God that the rest will be released very soon,\u201d Hayab said in a WhatsApp message to THISDAY.\n\nOn July 5, bandits invaded the school located about six kilometers away from Kaduna metropolis and abducted 121 students. The students have since been released in batches by the bandits.\n\nSo far, four batches of students, totaling 110 had been released, including those, who escaped from captivity.\n\nParents of the students were said to have paid a total of over N200 million as ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe bandits were said to have demanded and collected fresh ransom for each batch of students released.\n\nThree suspects arrested in connection with the abduction of the students were recently paraded by the Force Headquarters of the Nigerian police in Abuja.\n\nOn the the recent killing of some soldiers by insurgents in Marte-Dikwa, Borno, Ndume implored the military not to be deterred by the incident, which reportedly claimed the lives of no fewer than 15 soldiers.\n\nNdume, who is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, in a release on Sunday, called on the troops in war theatre area of Borno State not to allow their morale to be dampened.\n\nAccording to him, what happened is not enough to low the spirit of the soldiers but urged them to continue in the fight against insurgency and ending the menace in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe killing of the soldiers between Marte and Dikwa in Borno State is highly condemnable, it is sad and unfortunate. This should not discourage the troops and the Army from taking the war to the Insurgents. We send our condolences to the family of those killed and pray that God grant them eternal rest especially, as they died in the course of serving their father land.\u201d\n\nNdume added that as a nation, the people must continue to encourage and pray for the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouk Yahaya, along with the military hierarchy and officers and men for the good work they have been doing to end the Boko Haram insurgency attacks.\n\nThe ranking Senator also called on the federal government to adequately fund the military so that the officers and men could perform optimally.\n\nLast Friday, dozens of military troops on pass and on their way to Maiduguri, Borno State capital, were ambushed by suspected members of Boko Haram linked to ISWAP, killing several of them.\n\nThe incident reportedly took place between Marte-Dikwa council areas, when the insurgents fired rocket launchers at military trucks, which culminated into sporadic shootings targeting troops being conveyed from Marte to Maiduguri, after spending some time at the theatre.\n\nMarte, about 180km north of Maiduguri, remains one of the council areas of Borno not fully occupied by civilian population, as most of its people have been displaced and taking refuge in Monguno, and some parts of Maiduguri.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Nasiru Haladu Danu sponsored the pro-President Muhammadu Buhari protest which was recently held in New York, United States, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\nDanu was said to have single-handedly ensured the payment of $50 per hour to over 50 men and women who came out for the rally.\n\n\"The 'One Nigeria' protest which is pro-Buhari was funded by Nasiru Danu. He funded all the Pro-Buhari hired crowd at the United Nations General Assembly in New York,\" a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters also got the copy of a mail written by one of the organisers of the protest titled, \u2018I need 50 people men and women for tomorrow morning 50$ a hour (sic) (Midtown East)'.\n\nIt reads: \u201cGood evening, I need 50 people men and women, preferably black, to come support and cheer for a black government official at the United Nations headquarters on midtown East Manhattan at exactly 11.30am. The whole gig will be around a hour (sic) and a half to 2 hours, you'll be compensated on the spot by me 50 dollars a hour. Text or call me asap if interested 7184130053 for more details, bring more people if you can please. See you all tomorrow.\u201d\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters showed that the phone number attached to the email belongs to one Ogundare Olukemi who is said to be based in New York, United States.\n\nFrom further checks, the main sponsor, Danu had over time identified as a die-hard Buhari loyalist and has enjoyed the support of the Buhari administration.\n\nHis flagship company, Casiva, which is also into security, civil and mechanical construction, supply, and procurement, was listed among the 15 consortia/companies awarded the 2019/2020 contracts for the exchange of crude oil for imported petroleum products by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.\n\nInformation about Casiva Limited on its website reads: \u201cCasiva Limited is an indigenous company offering services in Procurement, Project Management and Logistics, committed to delivering Solutions and Services for Construction, Oil & Gas Industries, Security equipment, and accessories; as a total solution provider for all your security requirements.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that in 2016, Danu\u2019s company was awarded a contract for the provision of pipeline security and maintenance services along the Kaduna-Kano and Zaria-Gusau segments.\n\nDanu, was in March 2021 accused of conniving with some top officials of the Nigeria Customs Service to defraud the Nigerian government of N51 billion, meant to improve Customs revenue.\n\nDanu is an arrowhead in what is now known in some quarters as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s oil mafia group.\n\nA source said the fraud, which implicates the Comptroller General of the NCS, Col Hameed Ali (rtd), was named \u201cRevenue Assurance Fraud\" by some officials of the agency.\n\nHe however denied the allegations through a March 6, 2021 letter to SaharaReporters by his lawyer, Bose Olanipekun of Wole Olanipekun & Co.\n\nIn 2019, Danu made headlines when he was reportedly arrested at Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, for an alleged passport scam and money laundering.\n\nHe was reportedly caught with a fake Malta Passport and in his possession, more than \u00a3200,000.00 in cash.\n\nDanu, who hails from Jigawa State, is currently the traditional title-holder of \u2018Dan Amanar Dutse\u2019 in the state.\n\nVideo Shows Alleged Recruitment Of Pro-Buhari Protesters\n\nIn a video seen by SaharaReporters, some Nigerians in the diaspora agitating for self-determination accuses the Pro-Buhari protesters of collecting $50 per hour.\n\nThey are heard explaining to the Pro-Buhari protesters that killings are going on in Nigeria as the protesters are seen going into a room and coming out with T-shirts.\n\nThey also appear like hired foreigners.\n\nA voice could be heard saying, \u201cThey hired them for $50 per hour and gave them clothes. As you can see, they are doing the transaction inside that place.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018One Nigeria group' is giving clothes to these people inside that place.\n\n\u201cYou can see that most of these people are not Nigerians, they were hired.\"\n\nAnother voice added, \u201cNigeria is a terrorist country, the government of Nigeria is killing people. The Nigerian government is a wicked government. It is tyrannical.\u201d See Also News VIDEO: Non-Nigerian Man In US Confirms SaharaReporters' Story, Confesses He Was Paid Be Pro-Buhari Protester\n\nThe Pro-Buhari protesters, were however unbothered as they go in and out of the \u2018transaction\u2019 room.\n\nThis newspaper recalls a report from September 21 stating that pro-government Nigerian protesters who countered groups agitating for self-determination in New York, United States were paid $50 per hour.\n\nOne of the people involved in \u201cthe deal\u201d told SaharaReporters that the \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protesters were promised $50 for one hour and $150 for three hours to be at the venue of the protest and to show support for the Buhari regime despite the glaring failures.\n\n\u201cOne of the organisers of the fake 'One Nigeria' protest who bribed some Nigerians with the money is Haruna Bello,\u201d a top source revealed to SaharaReporters.\n\nAlso, a woman confirmed that she was contacted by the organisers of the \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protest but she declined.\n\nThe source said the organisers requested a copy of the identity card of those who would be joining the protest which caused an uproar and made some people back out of the protest.\n\nShe said, \u201cI was invited for the pro-Buhari protest. The organisers promised to pay $50 for one hour and we'll be there for three hours. The person did not know we are Oduduwa adherents; we played along as if we didn't understand him. He explained that he was given a contract to do it but yesterday, it became an issue. See Also Politics Three Groups Of Protesters To Storm UN Headquarters In New York As Buhari Addresses General Assembly\n\n\u201cNigerians who initially agreed later had an issue with the organisers because the organisers of the pro-Buhari protest said those who would join the protest must tender their ID cards, a copy would be made and taken to the Nigerian House but those ones refused because an ID card in America is very significant.\n\n\u201cWith that, the organisers had to quickly go and look for any other Nigerian they saw or those who had no legal papers yet and who are in need of the $150, that they would take them to the venue.

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Nasiru Haladu Danu sponsored the pro-President Muhammadu Buhari protest which was recently held in New York, United States, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\nDanu was said to have single-handedly ensured the payment of $50 per hour to over 50 men and women who came out for the rally.\n\n\"The 'One Nigeria' protest which is pro-Buhari was funded by Nasiru Danu. He funded all the Pro-Buhari hired crowd at the United Nations General Assembly in New York,\" a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters also got the copy of a mail written by one of the organisers of the protest titled, \u2018I need 50 people men and women for tomorrow morning 50$ a hour (sic) (Midtown East)'.\n\nIt reads: \u201cGood evening, I need 50 people men and women, preferably black, to come support and cheer for a black government official at the United Nations headquarters on midtown East Manhattan at exactly 11.30am. The whole gig will be around a hour (sic) and a half to 2 hours, you'll be compensated on the spot by me 50 dollars a hour. Text or call me asap if interested 7184130053 for more details, bring more people if you can please. See you all tomorrow.\u201d\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters showed that the phone number attached to the email belongs to one Ogundare Olukemi who is said to be based in New York, United States.\n\nFrom further checks, the main sponsor, Danu had over time identified as a die-hard Buhari loyalist and has enjoyed the support of the Buhari administration.\n\nHis flagship company, Casiva, which is also into security, civil and mechanical construction, supply, and procurement, was listed among the 15 consortia/companies awarded the 2019/2020 contracts for the exchange of crude oil for imported petroleum products by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.\n\nInformation about Casiva Limited on its website reads: \u201cCasiva Limited is an indigenous company offering services in Procurement, Project Management and Logistics, committed to delivering Solutions and Services for Construction, Oil & Gas Industries, Security equipment, and accessories; as a total solution provider for all your security requirements.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that in 2016, Danu\u2019s company was awarded a contract for the provision of pipeline security and maintenance services along the Kaduna-Kano and Zaria-Gusau segments.\n\nDanu, was in March 2021 accused of conniving with some top officials of the Nigeria Customs Service to defraud the Nigerian government of N51 billion, meant to improve Customs revenue.\n\nDanu is an arrowhead in what is now known in some quarters as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s oil mafia group.\n\nA source said the fraud, which implicates the Comptroller General of the NCS, Col Hameed Ali (rtd), was named \u201cRevenue Assurance Fraud\" by some officials of the agency.\n\nHe however denied the allegations through a March 6, 2021 letter to SaharaReporters by his lawyer, Bose Olanipekun of Wole Olanipekun & Co.\n\nIn 2019, Danu made headlines when he was reportedly arrested at Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, for an alleged passport scam and money laundering.\n\nHe was reportedly caught with a fake Malta Passport and in his possession, more than \u00a3200,000.00 in cash.\n\nDanu, who hails from Jigawa State, is currently the traditional title-holder of \u2018Dan Amanar Dutse\u2019 in the state.\n\nVideo Shows Alleged Recruitment Of Pro-Buhari Protesters\n\nIn a video seen by SaharaReporters, some Nigerians in the diaspora agitating for self-determination accuses the Pro-Buhari protesters of collecting $50 per hour.\n\nThey are heard explaining to the Pro-Buhari protesters that killings are going on in Nigeria as the protesters are seen going into a room and coming out with T-shirts.\n\nThey also appear like hired foreigners.\n\nA voice could be heard saying, \u201cThey hired them for $50 per hour and gave them clothes. As you can see, they are doing the transaction inside that place.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018One Nigeria group' is giving clothes to these people inside that place.\n\n\u201cYou can see that most of these people are not Nigerians, they were hired.\"\n\nAnother voice added, \u201cNigeria is a terrorist country, the government of Nigeria is killing people. The Nigerian government is a wicked government. It is tyrannical.\u201d See Also News VIDEO: Non-Nigerian Man In US Confirms SaharaReporters' Story, Confesses He Was Paid Be Pro-Buhari Protester\n\nThe Pro-Buhari protesters, were however unbothered as they go in and out of the \u2018transaction\u2019 room.\n\nThis newspaper recalls a report from September 21 stating that pro-government Nigerian protesters who countered groups agitating for self-determination in New York, United States were paid $50 per hour.\n\nOne of the people involved in \u201cthe deal\u201d told SaharaReporters that the \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protesters were promised $50 for one hour and $150 for three hours to be at the venue of the protest and to show support for the Buhari regime despite the glaring failures.\n\n\u201cOne of the organisers of the fake 'One Nigeria' protest who bribed some Nigerians with the money is Haruna Bello,\u201d a top source revealed to SaharaReporters.\n\nAlso, a woman confirmed that she was contacted by the organisers of the \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protest but she declined.\n\nThe source said the organisers requested a copy of the identity card of those who would be joining the protest which caused an uproar and made some people back out of the protest.\n\nShe said, \u201cI was invited for the pro-Buhari protest. The organisers promised to pay $50 for one hour and we'll be there for three hours. The person did not know we are Oduduwa adherents; we played along as if we didn't understand him. He explained that he was given a contract to do it but yesterday, it became an issue. See Also Politics Three Groups Of Protesters To Storm UN Headquarters In New York As Buhari Addresses General Assembly\n\n\u201cNigerians who initially agreed later had an issue with the organisers because the organisers of the pro-Buhari protest said those who would join the protest must tender their ID cards, a copy would be made and taken to the Nigerian House but those ones refused because an ID card in America is very significant.\n\n\u201cWith that, the organisers had to quickly go and look for any other Nigerian they saw or those who had no legal papers yet and who are in need of the $150, that they would take them to the venue. It was a staged protest. It was $50 an hour for three hours making it $150.\u201d\n\nTwo Nigerian groups with conflicting ideologies confronted each other in New York over the President's visit.\n\nThe groups had converged at the Nigerian House on 42nd Street, 2nd Avenue, airing opposing views about the issues of insecurity in Nigeria and its unity.\n\nThe protest began as President Muhammadu Buhari arrived in New York for his scheduled activities for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe One Nigeria group members carried placards on which were written, \u201cStronger together\u201d, \u201cUnity in diversity\u201d, \u201cGenocide in Eastern Nigeria plain propaganda\u201d,\n\n\u201cNigerians want national unity, not secession\u201d, \u201cNigerian Christians not targets of genocide or ethnic cleansing\u201d.\n\nThey were, however, opposed by some anti-Buhari protesters who had been organising protests for days calling for a referendum to determine the fate of the country.\n\nThe protesters who are calling for self-determination alleged that the members of the One Nigeria Group were \u201cfake\u201d Nigerians hired to display the country's flags and take pictures.",

However, our efforts on compliance at point of entry has been shown to be quite appreciable,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince the anticipation of the third wave, we have strengthened our surveillance system in the airports, seaports, as well as land borders.

          "text": "Source: TechCabal\n\nSeptember 27th, 2021.\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nOn Friday, towards the end of the Future of Commerce conference, I got into a chat with my colleague Damilare about his plans for the weekend. It included resting, hanging out with friends and watching some shows on Netflix.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention was him mentioning that he recently paid for a Netflix subscription. What made him make the switch? The recently released King of Boys series.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t sit out and miss out, so I had to. After all, it\u2019s just \u20a61,200 ($3),\u201d he said.\n\nMy first thought was that Damilare\u2019s sign up was an indication that Netflix\u2019s content strategy is making a difference. But when I thought about it again, I remembered that he signed up for the recently introduced mobile-only plan that costs 50% less than the standard plan.\n\nHis sign up is still a win for the streaming service but also a reminder that irrespective of how much people love Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, there are other competing priorities on this side of the world. To take a step further, there\u2019s an army of people whose mantra is free content or nothing.\n\nA screenshot of a blog comment section interaction between Kemi Adetiba (director and writer of King of Boys) and a few Nigerians who don\u2019t believe the series shouldn\u2019t exist behind Netflix\u2019s paywall.\n\nPartner Message\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today?\n\nSource: Flutterwave\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here.\n\nAnswered prayers\n\nThis realization is most likely what influenced Netflix\u2019s decision to introduce a free plan in Kenya this week. Clearly, the $3.99 (mobile-only plan) is still too much to ask of Africans.\n\nUnlike the typical 30 days trial which gives users access to Netflix\u2019s full library for a limited time, in this free plan Netflix is only making about one quarter of its movies and television shows catalog available.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the goal of the free plan is to reduce the friction in acquiring users, but it\u2019s not clear how long Netflix plans to offer this free in Kenya and whether it\u2019s considering expanding this offering to other markets.\n\nAmongst other players like Amazon prime video, Disney+ and Showmax, Netflix is expected to have the highest number of African subscribers in 2026 per Digital TV research. While Netflix has added a free content approach to its stack, what are other players doing?\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nPartner Message\n\n30%Club\n\nTake control of your investing journey.

The company stated that its goal is \u2018provide internet access to those who do not have access to fibre services\u2019. In simple terms, it\u2019s cheaper internet service coupled with access to DSTV\u2019s content. DSTV internet packages are about 60% cheaper than MTN regular data plans. For instance, 25 Gigabyte (GB) anytime and 25 GB Night-time data costs R229 ($15.35), while a similar package by MTN costs R599 ($40.16).\n\nAlthough there are questions around whether the internet plan is being subsidized by multichoice and how long they can continue doing this, it\u2019s a clever customer acquisition strategy.\n\nFor IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nollywood, it\u2019s betting on international markets since Africa hasn\u2019t provided the financial comfort it\u2019s looking for.\n\n\u201cAfrica is functionally poor\u2026@irokotv did a free movie a week for like 2-3 years. Tens of thousands of people used it weekly. <2% conversion.\u201d Jason Njoku, CEO of IROKOtv, said via Twitter in response to Netflix\u2019s decision to pivot to free. According to Jason, IROKOtv had to shut down the experiment when it was apparent that conversion was low and many users weren\u2019t interested in paying for a premium subscription.\n\nIROKOtv has been around for ten years and experimented with different tactics before deciding to pivot to focus more on its international market.\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nWhat does it take to succeed in Africa as a streaming service?\n\nWe\u2019ll start off with a low expectation of what success looks like because macro economic factors like disposable income, internet and smartphone penetration are low. After that we introduce cheap subscription plans and then create or acquire entertaining content to draw in new customers. This formula isn\u2019t complete until you sprinkle a lot of patience and luck because the journey is long and Africa is a different market.\n\nNetflix and Multichoice clearly have bigger purses than IROKOtv to persevere and try out a number of tactics hoping for a different result, but time will tell if more Africans will start paying for content.\n\nPartner Message\n\nStanford GSB\n\nNext on the Grit & Growth podcast: meet Elo Umeh, CEO of Terragon Group, a Nigerian marketing and insights firm, and experts from TLcom Capital, and learn how to maximise the value of your firm\u2019s next fundraising round.

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, September 23, 2021, Twitter continued its spate of new feature announcements with Tips, its new tipping feature.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise as the microblogging platform tested a similar feature \u2014 Tip Jar \u2014 back in May.\n\nWhile Tip Jar was limited to people using Twitter in English, including journalists and experts, Tips is currently available on iOS devices and will soon be rolled out on Android devices.\n\nIt also supports more third-party payment platforms like African payments platform, Chipper Cash. Twitter users can now send money to others through their profiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the tipping feature supports sending and receiving flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to a Twitter blog post, Twitter users can send and receive Bitcoin through Strike, a wallet built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 a staunch Bitcoin evangelist \u2014 once tweeted that it was only a matter of time before Twitter facilitated Bitcoin.\n\nTwitter\u2019s move to enable Bitcoin tipping through a wallet that uses the Lightning Network will speed up Bitcoin transfers. This could make the virtual currency more appealing, triggering wider adoption.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network is a route that eases Bitcoin transactions \u2014 off-chain \u2014 outside the Bitcoin network. It is basically a network that allows transactions to occur immediately and be recorded on the Blockchain later.\n\nThe Lightning Network was created to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem. Asides from volatility, the slow speed of Bitcoin transactions makes them impractical for everyday transactions.\n\nFor context, Visa, a digital payments platform, claims it can handle 65,000 transactions per second. However, according to a news report by Bitcoin.com, it can only perform 1,700. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is only capable of seven per second \u2014 a staggering difference.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s transaction speed is the price of decentralisation and security. Miners validate transactions on the network by solving complex math problems with powerful computer hardware, a process that ensures safety but takes time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin for daily transactions\n\nThe Lightning Network skips the miners and creates an off-chain or a direct channel between the sender and receiver. This will make Bitcoin tipping on Twitter immediate. According to Investopedia, \u201cA lightning network channel is a transaction mechanism between two parties. Using channels, the parties can make or receive payments from each other.\u201d\n\nOnce the channel is closed, the transaction gets added to the Blockchain. Therefore, a grocery shop that accepts Bitcoin can create a channel with customers to speed up transactions.\n\nSpeaking with Bloomberg, Strike CEO, Jack Mallers, says integrating the technology on Twitter will have far more implications beyond Twitter or even Strike.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a monetary network that expands the entire globe and can achieve instant, nearly free global cash finality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a broader trend of companies using the world\u2019s first global monetary network to interact with their users in a monetary fashion.\u201d\n\nStrike is also the wallet enabling the exchange of Bitcoin in El Salvador, the first country to make it a legal tender. While Strike solves the problem of speed, volatility remains an issue.\n\nSpeaking about this, Mallers says, \u201cYou can send and make Bitcoin payments with dollars and receive Bitcoin payments as dollars.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence and software company, Micheal Saylor, dubbed the technology the future of global payments.\n\nSpeed comes at a cost\n\nWhile the Lightning Network offers immediate transactions at low fees, it also has its disadvantages.\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, offline transaction scams are some of the biggest challenges of the Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cIf one participant in a payment channel chooses to close it while the other party is offline, the former can steal the funds.\u201d\n\nPayments also get stuck on the Lightning Network. And although they\u2019re almost always refunded, this could take days.\n\nGenerally, cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology are constantly going through improvements and innovation as they\u2019re still relatively new.\n\nJack Dorsey has said Bitcoin would unite the world and bring peace; only time will tell if his prediction will come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nStranerd\u2019s plans for university students\n\nTwitter\u2019s Bitcoin plans\n\nSome news about Nigeria\u2019s 5G scene\n\nStranerd\u2019s plans for university students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStranerd\u2019s co-founders. Timmy Salami and Jeremiah Godwin\n\nOver the past few years, edtech solutions have sprung up in Nigeria to assist the work done by schools in the country.\n\nHowever, most of them focus on students in primary and secondary schools, with only a handful serving students in the university or those looking to get in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStranerd, an edtech startup founded by Jeremiah Godwin and Timmy Salami, is looking to plug that gap.\n\nWhat started as an Instagram page solving problems for students has since evolved into a platform connecting Nigerian students to tutors and their peers.\n\nSince launching, the startup has served over 40,000 students in 11 countries and plans to add more services in the future, including internships and study-abroad opportunities.\n\nCurious about Stranerd? Check out How edtech startup, Stranerd is connecting Nigerian students to tutors\n\nTwitter\u2019s new feature, Tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, September 23, 2021, Twitter announced Tip, a feature that will allow users to tip their favourite creators directly from Twitter.\n\nFamiliar? Of course, it is. In May, the micro-blogging site announced testing a new feature called Tip Jar, which only differed from Tip in who had access \u2014 English Twitter users and a control group including journalists and experts.\n\nLike Tip Jar, the new feature works with third-party fintech apps like Cash App, Venmo, and Chipper and is currently available for iOS users, with the rollout for Android users coming this week. But that\u2019s not the interesting part.\n\nYou can also send a tip in Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Simply add your Bitcoin wallet to your profile and start receiving tips in Bitcoin. Alternatively, users in El Salvador and the US can use Strike.\n\nWhat\u2019s Strike? It is a crypto wallet that runs on the Lightning Network, which speeds up Bitcoin transactions.\n\nMore gibberish? Well, here\u2019s a little explainer. The Lightning Network is a network that facilitates immediate Bitcoin transactions without going through miners. Essentially, it makes sending and receiving Bitcoin faster, just like fiat currencies.\n\nThe Strike wallet is currently used in El Salvador, the first country to use Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nAccording to Jack Mallers, Strike CEO, the integration on Twitter will lead to global usage.\n\nDuring the week, Our reporter, Bolu Abiodun, will explore the Lightning Network, the Twitter use case, and everything else in between.\n\nLook out for it.\n\nCatching up on the latest 5G news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@macauphotoagency\u201d>Macau Photo Agency</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/5g?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nIn the last few weeks, Nigeria\u2019s 5G deployment seems to have gained some traction.\n\nMore recently, on Thursday, September 23, 2021, Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, revealed that the 5G network would be available by January 2022.\n\nHe disclosed this at a town hall meeting organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture to address vandalism of power and telecommunications infrastructure, where he was represented by Ubale Maska, Commissioner for Technical Services, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nThis comes two weeks after Nigeria\u2019s government approved the deployment of the 5G network.\n\nBefore that, in May 2021, the NCC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on the use of C-Band Spectrum for 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nAlso, in June 2021, the Commission inaugurated a committee on Spectrum auction for 5G deployment, which is expected to take place in the last quarter of the year.\n\nSo far, MTN is the only telco that has conducted successful 5G tests in Nigeria and is eagerly waiting to deploy the technology as soon as NCC conducts its auction.\n\nHowever, considering that the 3G and 4G networks only recently overtook 2G coverage in Africa, the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) is sceptical about the mass adoption of the 5G network anytime soon.\n\nAccording to the NCC, broadband penetration stood at 39.79% as of July 2021. And Maska told the House of Representatives in July that less than 50% of the country enjoys 3G coverage.\n\nThere\u2019s also the challenge of the affordability of 5G-enabled phones and the cost of setting up infrastructure for telcos.\n\nThis or that? Going by Pantami\u2019s words and if the NCC holds a spectrum auction, all things point to a January 2022 date for 5G deployment in Nigeria. Will it gain fast usage? That\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer for now.\n\nMeanwhile, you can check out 4 things we learnt from MTN Nigeria\u2019s 5G demo\n\nCatch up on these stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nGig work is precarious no matter the country.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Boss Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in the United States, Godwin talked with a girl. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari boldly declared last Thursday while addressing world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Nigeria will spare no efforts at getting rid of the Boko Haram terrorists, a humbling indictment that the war against the terrorist group remained unfinished after over a decade of ravaging Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt was in December 2015, some seven months after he became president that Buhari announced that Nigeria had \u201ctechnically won the war\u201d against the Islamist Boko Haram militants.\n\nHe told the BBC that the terrorist group could no longer mount \u201cconventional attacks\u201d against security forces or population centres. It had been reduced to fighting with improvised explosives devices (IED) and remained a force only in its heartland of Borno State.\n\nBuhari continues to insist that the group has lost its teeth and is severely weakened. \u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism; as a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d Buhari told the world leaders. Only a few days before, the insurgents had killed over 25 soldiers who were on patrol in Monguno area of Borno State.\n\nDescribed as one of the world\u2019s most lethal terror groups, Boko Haram and its affiliate groups have forced the closure of more than 600 schools in the northern part of Nigeria since 2010. In 2014, the group audaciously kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in the southern-Borno town of Chibok. Seven years later, more than 100 of the girls, with some 40 estimated to have died, have not been seen. Thousands of other students have been kidnapped since then.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s fighters target women and girls with rape and other sexual violence, amounting to war crimes during raids in northeast Nigeria.\n\nOsai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria, noted, \u201cAs Boko Haram continue their relentless cycle of killings, abductions and looting, they are also subjecting women and girls to rape and other sexual violence during their attacks. These atrocities are war crimes.\n\n\u201cThe targeted communities have been abandoned by the (Nigerian) forces that are supposed to protect them, and are struggling to gain any recognition or response to the horrors they\u2019ve suffered. The Nigerian authorities must urgently address this issue\u201d.\n\nIn the beginning was Boko Haram\n\nBoko Haram was founded in the early 2000s by the late Mohammed Yusuf. The group whose name translates as \u201cwestern education is forbidden\u201d was like Islamist groups that have formed throughout Nigeria\u2019s history, committed to creating an anti-Western state, using violence if necessary.\n\nHowever, throughout Yusuf\u2019s tenure as the group\u2019s leader, Boko Haram sought to achieve its aims largely through peaceful means. From 2002 to 2009, the group supported Ali Modu Sheriff\u2019s bid for governor and was incorporated into his government when he won in 2003. Yusuf\u2019s father-in-law served as Sheriff\u2019s commissioner for religious affairs.\n\nThe group\u2019s founder and leader Mohammed Yusuf, was a fiery Wahhabi preacher who espoused Salafist beliefs.\n\nWahhabi is a label given to those who follow the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, an 18th Century Saudi preacher. Wahabism is a form of Sunni Islam and it is the only officially accepted religion of Saudi Arabia, which brutally suppresses other religious tendencies whether Islamic or non-Islamic. This brand of Islam is particularly intolerant of Shia and Sufi faiths which it considers heretical. The Wahhabis are always referred to as Salafis, and in fact they prefer to be called as such. As a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafis but not all Salafis are Wahhabis.\n\nThe term Salafism did not become associated with the Wahhabi creed until the 1970s. It was in the early 20th Century that the Wahhabis referred to themselves as Salafis. A Salafist is an individual who emphasises the importance of returning to a \u201cpure\u201d Islam, that of the Salaf, the pious ancestors. Salafists advocate literal and to some degree binary interpretation of Islamic teachings as enjoined by Prophet Muhammad and subsequently practised by the early pious predecessors known as the salaf al-salih. Following the salaf is the reason for their self-designation as Salafis.\n\nIn July 2009, the group launched a revolt through coordinated attacks in four locations in northern Nigeria; Bauchi in Bauchi State, Maiduguri in Borno State, Potiskum in Yobe State and Wudil in Kano State. The aim was to trigger the violent creation of an Islamic state. The revolt was ruthlessly suppressed by the army.\n\nYusuf was captured in his parents-in-law\u2019s house in Maiduguri by a unit of the Army\u2019s 21st Armoured Brigade. They handed him to the Nigeria Police. The Nigeria police, allegedly notorious for heavy handedness and extra-judicial killings, summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in the city. Police officials variously claimed that he was shot while trying to escape, or that he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government acknowledged the extra-judicial murder of the Boko Haram founder and promised to investigate the incident. Unsurprisingly, nothing has ever come out of that promise.\n\nBitter at the brutal suppression of their uprising and the unwarranted murder of their leader, Boko Haram began a decade of brutal war against the Nigerian state and innocent people in the region. Today, it has become a war without end.\n\nThe group acquired new leadership under Abubakar Shekau, a Kanuri who had been Yusuf\u2019s deputy. Shekau, according to former US Ambassador to Nigeria and Africa analyst at the Centre for Foreign Relations, John Campbell, \u201cwas a monster, known for his brutal executions that he publicized, his use of women and children as suicide bombers, and his wholesale kidnapping: he orchestrated the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls, more than a hundred of whom remain in captivity. He mastered the politics of terror. He was charismatic and erratic with some education: he deliberately misquoted Abraham Lincoln. He was also a religious leader and drew on the well of Islamic grievance in northern Nigeria to produce a belief system largely regarded as a perversion of Salafist-inflected Islam but one which has spread in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nUnder Shekau, the group swiftly enlarged the deadliness and regularity of its attacks on government and civilian targets in Nigeria, while recruiting from relegated, oppressed, and poor populations across the region. Boko Haram withstood the Nigerian military\u2019s poorly planned, poorly resourced, and half-hearted attempts to beat it back.\n\nA season of sorrow, tears and pain\n\nBoko Haram has since 2009 killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. The UNDP says that nearly 350,000 people have been killed in the North-East since the insurgency against the Nigerian state began.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), some 3,000,000 people have been displaced in the Lake Chad region and about 310,000 Nigerians have become refugees. More than 1,100 people were killed in the first half of 2020, according to Amnesty International, with more than 300 deaths in April alone.\n\nThe group killed at least 967 people in 2017, marginally more than the 910 deaths that were reported in 2016. It has consistently mounted attacks over the years, challenging Mr. Buhari\u2019s claim that the militants had been beaten. It caused 750 security force casualties in 2019 alone, close to double that of any prior year.\n\nIn January 2020, the terrorist group kidnapped Reverend Lawan Andimi, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in Adamawa State, rejected a ransom and executed him that month. That same month, they attacked Michika and later Garkida in Adamawa, killing scores of innocent civilians In February, several buses and trucks carrying passengers were set on fire in Auno, Borno State. The attack killed at least 30.\n\nThe trucks were stranded at a military checkpoint due to a curfew set by the military. In March, the extremists ambushed Goneri village in Yobe State. The attack killed over 50 soldiers. In November 2018, more than one hundred Nigerian soldiers were reported killed in one single attack on an army base in Metele, Borno State. \u201cThe insurgents took us unawares,\u201d said an officer who spoke to Reuters. \u201cThe base was burned with arms and we lost about 100 soldiers. It is a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThat same year, 76 farm workers were slaughtered in rice fields near the village of Zabarmari. Boko Haram said the attack was waged to seek revenge on villagers for seizing the group\u2019s fighters and handing them over to the authorities.\n\nA floundering government\n\nFor a government big on optics and low on solutions, and keen to deodorise the noxious socio-political environment that has pitted the people against an administration that has failed to win the war it claims to have largely or technically won, the President and his officials have consistently doubled down on the lie that Boko Haram has been essentially defeated.\n\nLieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the immediate past and longest serving army Chief, on February 24, 2016, giddily yet falsely announced to members of the once vociferous but now largely noiseless Borno Elders Forum, \u201cwe were given three major tasks and we have made efforts toward achieving two. The first task is to defeat Boko Haram and I want to tell you that as of today Boko Haram has been defeated. When I say defeat, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there won\u2019t be hitches here and there. We have entered the mop-up stage of our operation\u201d.\n\nInformation minister, Lai Mohammed, in 2019 said, \u201cI stand by what I said that Boko Haram is technically defeated. What we are having today is global terrorism where you have the ISIS, ISWAP Al-Qaeda all working together\u201d.\n\nYet, just a year later, he complained that, \u201cterrorists use media and publicity as oxygen and so when they go on this kind of mindless killings, a dying terrorist group will suddenly spring to life. However, we must also understand that we are dealing with terrorists who are financed globally and we also need more support from global partners.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Nigeria had made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with the terrorists, but for one reason or the other we have been denied these platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2020, almost five years after claiming to have largely defeated Boko Haram, Mr. Buhari railed against the people of Borno State after being booed by the residents of the capital city, Maiduguri. He blamed the leaders of Borno communities for not doing enough in terms of cooperation with the military to end the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\n\u201cThis Boko Haram or whoever they are, cannot come up to Maiduguri or its environs to attack without the local leadership knowing\u2026 As the commander in chief, I will deal with the security situation\u201d, he said.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Boko Haram launched a seven-hour assault on a Chadian army base at Bohoma that killed 93 Chadian soldiers, the deadliest-ever attack by Boko Haram on the country\u2019s military forces. In response Chadian President, Idriss Deby, adorned his army fatigues, rallied his forces from all fronts, and ramped up targeted and sweeping air, ground and amphibious operations against the terrorists. Tagged \u2018Operation Boma Anger\u2019, this military campaign was so effective that Boko Haram\u2019s hunted leader, Abubakar Shekau had to release a viral message to his fleeing fighters pleading with them not to run away from the battle but to \u201ctake heart\u201d as God was bigger than the army of Chad.\n\nObviously embarrassed by the tenacity and outcomes of the widely applauded Chadian offensive, Nigeria\u2019s Army Chief of Staff, Tukur Buratai announced that he was relocating to the North-East \u201cwhere he is overseeing and directing the overall operation in the theatre and other Nigerian Army operations across the country\u201d.\n\nTo many analysts, it was abundantly clear that it was the height of the usual government optics, nothing tangible ever came out of that hurriedly assembled relocation ordered by the President.\n\nIn December of that year, having been unable to deliver on his vow to defeat Boko Haram, Mr. Buratai shockingly predicted that Nigeria will most likely continue to suffer terrorist attacks for the next 20 years.\n\n\u201cThis crisis might not end in 20 years, \u201che had said. \u201cWe have achieved a lot of successes but we cannot continue to use the same tactics and achieve different results. It only depends on the level of escalation and the appropriate responses by all stakeholders both civil and military authorities. Also, by both local and international actors. Citizens\u2019 responsibility is equally important and imperative. All must cooperate to contain the lingering insecurity. Let there be collective action and responsibility,\u201d he had said.\n\nPerhaps basking in the euphoria of battlefield successes of 2015 and 2016, the former Nigerian Army Commander had been too quick to declare victory. Watchers of the Nigerian military do remember that in the midst of Nigeria\u2019s election season, and determined to ensure victory at the polls, then President Goodluck Jonathan in early 2015 ordered a renewed military offensive against Boko Haram. Led by then GOC of the 7 Division, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun, the Army began making headway against the group. The Nigerian Military, supported by private military contractors led by Eeben Barlow\u2019s \u2018Specialised Tasks, Training, Equipment and Protection International\u2019, STTEP, seized back most of the territory previously held by Boko Haram.\n\nIn February of that year, Monguno, the local government of Mr. Buhari\u2019s National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno as well as Marte local government were recaptured from Boko Haram. By the time Buhari assumed office in May 2015, practically all the territory under Boko Haram\u2019s control had been taken over by the Nigerian Military and that was why elections took place in all the local governments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in 2015, and Buhari and his party won an overwhelming majority of votes in those states. The Tukur Buratai led Army from August 2015 merely consolidated on the initial victories chalked up by the pre-Buhari administration.\n\nBy mid-2017, the Nigerian Army had begun to lose the initiative and hand back territories to Boko Haram. In February this year, Boko Haram again hoisted its flag in Marte. In June 2020, at least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were said to have been killed in twin attacks on Monguno and Nganzai, that came days after some 81 villagers were killed in Gubio. The loss of territories began with the removal of the Theatre Commander, Major-General Leo Irabor, now Chief of Defence Staff in May 2017 alongside the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, then Brigadier-General Emeka Ezeogwu and their replacement with Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru and Brigadier-General Ibrahim Yusuf, respectively.\n\nImmediate past governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima would later in 2018 decry this inopportune change when as governor he opined that the Boko Haram insurgency regained momentum in 2017 because of the failure of command at the theatre of war. He lamented, \u201cthe change of guard at the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command which saw the replacement of Lucky Irabor, a Major General who is now at the Multinational Joint Task Force, did not help in sustaining the winning spirit of troops,\u201d adding that Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru \u201cdid not give a good account of himself as his tenure as Theatre Commander was greeted by embarrassing attacks on troops and civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian state as the problem\n\nThe contest for political, economic and social power in Nigeria is largely driven by religion in Northern Nigeria, while ethnicity is the basis for power contestation in the South. That is why most violence in the North tends to have religious colourations even if it is really nothing more than a competition over a piece of land.\n\nNigeria has since the 1980s been characterised by varying forms of ethno-religious violence.\n\nBeginning with the Maitasine insurgency between 1979 and 1983 in which between 4000-6000 lost their lives, and trailed by a plethora of successive ethnic, religious and social upheavals in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nigerian state has unenthusiastically dealt with these nihilist insurgencies in a manner that laid the basis for the insurrection against the state by Boko Haram.\n\nSome of the prominent examples include those of the Kasuwan Magani in 1980, Zango Kataf and Gure-Kahugu in 1987, Kafanchan and Lere in 1987, Ilorin and Jerein 1989, Tafawa Balewa in 1991 as well as that of Zango Kataf in 1992, Kaduna in 2000, Jos in 2001. No part of Northern Nigeria has been immune of violence of one religious nature or the other\n\nPerpetrators of religious violence have rarely been brought to justice. There has been a long culture of appeasement of religion by successive Nigerian governments, which has culminated in the emboldening of religious zealots assured of almost a free pass by the Nigerian state. It is common in Nigeria to keep hearing of sponsors of Boko Haram and other violent actors, sometimes coming out of government circles, yet, no one is ever charged or outed. A former security officer agreed that \u201cwhen religious and communal conflicts occur, we tend to look purely at the political dimension without seeking to prosecute and punish criminal actors. Perhaps, if this is consistently done, it would make those who engineer these criminal activities to think twice\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe inability of the Nigerian state to forcefully challenge political religion has led to new theatres of war in the north. This leads to the conclusion that the boldness of these new actors is linked to the government\u2019s inability to deal decisively with the crisis in the north-east.\n\nThus, the battle against Boko Haram can be justifiably termed the battle Nigeria was supposed to fight years and years ago but refused to.\n\nInternational dimension of Boko Haram\n\nIt has been suggested within intelligence circles both in Nigeria and outside, that the unending Boko Haram insurgency has its fibrous roots outside the country. There is ample evidence as consistently stated by the leadership of the United States Africa Command and supported by intelligence reports by Nigeria\u2019s different intelligence services, that Boko Haram has over time received training, funding and logistic support from Islamist elements in Mauritania, Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) as well as from the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab responsible for the recent deadly terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIn March 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Abubakar Shekau, the group\u2019s then leader, said, \u201cWe announce our allegiance to the caliph\u2026 and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity. We call on Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the caliph.\u201d\n\nThus, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) was formed. With its most significant provinces in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nAfrica analyst, Jacob Zenn, noted that, as ISIS faced defeat and began losing its \u201cterritorial caliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, the terror group\u2019s leadership knew that the organisation would have to depend on external \u201cprovinces\u201d (called wilayat) to keep its global project thriving. The provinces would launch attacks and remain loyal to ISIS, and ISIS could claim that the \u201ccaliphate\u201d might no longer be expanding, but it was remaining. With setbacks in Afghanistan and the Philippines, Africa emerged as the only continent where ISIS could operate like it did in Syria and Iraq during its heyday. So long as ISIS thrives in Africa, the dream of the global caliphate remains alive.\n\nNot only can ISIS conduct sophisticated attacks in Africa, it also can occupy territories and overpower armies. Moreover, with rapidly increasing populations, historical narratives about reviving pre-colonial Islamic states, and challenges resulting from weak governance and security forces\u2019 abuses, ISIS finds fertile ground on the continent.\n\nBy June 2019, ISWAP was becoming ISIS\u2019s strongest external province. ISIS\u2019s influence had become so strong in the Sahel and Lake Chad region that it could order the capture and execution of Boko Haram\u2019s leader and one time ISIS ally, Abubakar Shekau.\n\nShekau, one of the most notorious leaders of Islamic militant groups anywhere in the world, died in May after detonating an explosive device while being pursued by fighters from ISWAP. The ISWAP fighters had stormed the Sambisa Forest, a swath of strategically important dense forest in Nigeria\u2019s north-east, which was Shekau\u2019s base.\n\nBulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Reuters after Shekau\u2019s death that Islamic State \u201cis consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and Shekau\u2019s stronghold\u201d.\n\nCorruption benefits Boko Haram\n\nNigeria\u2019s military budgetary allocation is higher than the budgets of all other West African countries\u2019 defence or military operations put together. In 2020, military expenditure for Nigeria was $2,568 billion. Between 2015 and 2020, $11, 881 billion was spent on the military with little accruing to the country by way of peace.\n\nOn the contrary, the frontiers of violence in the country have expanded widely since 2015, as the military have been hampered by an equally dangerous enemy \u2013 corruption.\n\nTransparency International (TI) in a 2014 report noted that Nigerian military officers, politicians and other elites have enriched themselves by diverting money that was meant to fight terror. Since defence makes up 20 percent of Nigeria\u2019s budget, it is an attractive target.\n\nSeven years later, nothing has changed. Two retired army generals agreed that a lot of the budgetary allocations to the armed forces disappeared through bribes, payments to \u201cghost soldiers\u201d who don\u2019t exist, and through contracts not tendered and contested for, resulting in inflated spending that benefits politically-connected contractors.\n\n\u201cIf you want to solve the Boko Haram issue, follow the money\u201d, one said. He added that corruption is the biggest driver of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe lack of an updated, published defence policy weakens the accountability of the whole defence sector and makes scrutiny over defence matters, including budget and acquisition planning, harder.\n\nTransparency International in its 2020 Government Defence and Security report noted that while, \u201cthe annual defence budget is publicly available but the percentage of secret spending related to national security and intelligence services is difficult to establish, and off-budget expenditures are permitted by law, which often allows for non-orthodox practices, such as the \u2018security vote\u2019 to take place\u201d.\n\nIt further noted, \u201cSoldiers\u2019 payments are often irregular and hardly adequate in Nigeria, which has an impact on the motivation of its troops; this increases the likelihood of the phenomenon of the ghost soldiers, which is significant in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nOn corruption as an operational risk to the Nigerian military, the report gathered that, \u201cWhile corruption is recognised as an issue to be addressed within military circles, corruption is not systematically identified at the operational planning stage and is not seen as requiring contingency planning. There is no evidence of systematic corruption risk monitoring during operations.\n\n\u201cThere is provision made for training on issues relating to corruption, but it tends to be ad hoc and the connection between corruption, operational efficiency, and effectiveness could be emphasised further. The engagement of private military contractors in operations is unregulated, nor subject to scrutiny, and its costs are off-budget, meaning that private military contractors have access to significant power in an unregulated manner\u201d.\n\nIt further added that the procurement in the military is fraught with irregularities. Scrutiny, it said over matters of defence procurement \u201cis very limited in Nigeria. The Public Procurement Act excludes sensitive acquisitions relating to defence or security from its purview unless otherwise stated by the President, often resulting in significant expenditure going unscrutinised. Additionally, the lack of an updated defence policy contributes to the hardship in effectively scrutinising the sector\u2019s financial activities; for example, it makes the needs assessment phase of the budget cycle difficult to scrutinise and purchases are often ad hoc, rather than part of a long-term strategic acquisition plan. Information on the defence procurement cycle is not disclosed to the public and the National Assembly and external bodies play a marginal role in overseeing the process. Other unorthodox practices are also widespread, including security votes and single sourcing\u201d.\n\nEnding the war \u2013 What kind of reforms are needed?\n\nThe reality of terrorism and other anti-state violence is the exploitation of the inherent weaknesses in the operational capacity of the military in order to demean the authority of the state and vitiate the legitimacy of the government of the day. A weak security infrastructure certainly means a weak government. What is not in doubt, is that the Nigerian security services; including the military, police and special services, are not fit for purpose, as alleged by many Nigerians. They are operationally deficient, institutionally weak and structurally decayed.\n\nAs aptly noted in a June 2016 Crisis group report, \u201cthe decline began during 33 years of military dictatorship that took a serious toll on professionalism, operational effectiveness and accountability\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian military, which used to be among the continent\u2019s strongest and a backbone of regional and global peacekeeping efforts, has become a blemished force; suffering from an acute readiness crisis. It is overstretched, under-manned, grossly under-equipped, ill-trained, and poorly led. Even more unpleasant is the fact that the three services are locked in intense unhealthy competition, with neither the administrative head of the military (Minister of Defence) nor the operational head (Chief of Defence Staff) able to arbitrate.\n\nThis has resulted in lone wolf approaches to operations; with individual services working in silos rather than in concert, thus imperilling the counterterror/counterinsurgencies campaigns across the country. In addition, this obvious lack of operational and administrative oversight has resulted in the services pursuing prestige projects with no real value to operational capacity, frittering away already hard to get and inadequate resources.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2019, Nigeria\u2019s expenditure on military remained stable at around 0.5 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. In 2019, the military spending amounted to 0.46 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nAfter decades of underfunding the military, Nigeria\u2019s defence budget has increased substantially during the past 10 years. Yet the performance of the country\u2019s military remains poor. And the country\u2019s security challenges continue as can be seen from the latest data from the 2019 Global Terrorism Index report which ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017.\n\nWith this heavy expenditure, why are the outcomes so poor?\n\nAnti-corruption/transparency\n\nIt is more than obvious that the inability to get positive outcomes is due to the never-ending corruption prevalent in the military hierarchy in which budgetary allocations meant for military-centric activities are deployed to procure office goods, services, building structures, and overseas trips. In addition, there is also clear and irrefutable evidence that corrupt and incompetent security chiefs have turned the nation\u2019s security into a \u201cbusiness venture\u201d, thus jeopardising the capacity of the military to access effective and efficient resources and assets to defend the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nTraining and doctrine\n\nThe challenge facing the Nigerian military, as clearly evident over the last decade, is to train a force that is capable of winning wars. The operational environment and the changing Character of warfare necessitate a change in the way officers and men are recruited, trained, deployed and promoted.\n\nIn the conflict against Boko Haram, we have seen whole battalions running away from the battlefield, and cases of soldiers losing their will to fight. While access to efficient equipment has been cited as the main reason for this, it is obvious that it is a secondary reason.\n\nThere is ample evidence that soldiers from Niger, Chad and Cameroon are no better resourced than their Nigerian counterparts, yet they have proved to be more zealous on the battlefield and keener to take risks.\n\nOne of the critical factors responsible for this lethargic approach by the Nigerian military is the methodology for recruiting officers and soldiers, the manner of training and on-boarding, as well as the methodology for deploying and promoting them.\n\nThe Nigerian military has over the years become a \u2018tribal employment portal\u2019 where emphasis is placed on language, tribe and religion at the expense of capability, efficiency and merit.\n\nThe resultant outcome is a large corps of officers and men incapable of securing the country and unwilling to put their \u2018best foot\u2019 forward in the arena of battle. The reason is not hard to fathom; many joined the military not out of patriotism and a willingness to serve, but out of material need for a source of regular income.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to redefine who can become a soldier and how that process takes place. The distorted system of recruitment, postings, transfers, promotions, rewards and punishment needs a complete overhaul to engender patriotism and selflessness and thus, get the best of the best into the military.\n\nFurthermore, the deployment of soldiers for internal security operations such as anti-kidnapping, anti-crime and anti-cultism operations completely negates the training and doctrine as well as the responsibilities of the military.\n\nThe end result has been the erosion of the professionalism of soldiers as well as the vitiation of their distinctive soldierly quality as they get more and more involved in civilian matters.\n\nTo reverse this trend, it is more than important that the Police is encouraged and well-resourced to take on their assigned responsibilities of fighting crime and criminality in order to relieve the military of such extraneous duties that add no value to the capability of the military.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pressing imperative to interrogate the method of appointing the leadership of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Pertinent questions to ask in this regard include: Must ethnicity and religion be the yardstick for determining who heads the varied services or should clear evidence of academic, operations, leadership and management capability be the sensible criteria?\n\nShould course mates and seniors of newly appointed chiefs who aren\u2019t due for retirement be forced to resign, thus depleting the services of well-trained officers and managers. Isn\u2019t it reasonable and more compelling for the country and the military that those who are willing to continue serving be allowed to do so? Shouldn\u2019t service chiefs be constitutionally allowed to serve two terms of two years each in order to insulate them from political influence of the executive leadership? Isn\u2019t there a need to place an embargo on the promotion of senior officers in the military until such a time when the major conflict in the north-east has been decisively won?",

          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari boldly declared last Thursday while addressing world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Nigeria will spare no efforts at getting rid of the Boko Haram terrorists, a humbling indictment that the war against the terrorist group remained unfinished after over a decade of ravaging Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt was in December 2015, some seven months after he became president that Buhari announced that Nigeria had \u201ctechnically won the war\u201d against the Islamist Boko Haram militants.\n\nHe told the BBC that the terrorist group could no longer mount \u201cconventional attacks\u201d against security forces or population centres. It had been reduced to fighting with improvised explosives devices (IED) and remained a force only in its heartland of Borno State.\n\nBuhari continues to insist that the group has lost its teeth and is severely weakened. \u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism; as a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d Buhari told the world leaders. Only a few days before, the insurgents had killed over 25 soldiers who were on patrol in Monguno area of Borno State.\n\nDescribed as one of the world\u2019s most lethal terror groups, Boko Haram and its affiliate groups have forced the closure of more than 600 schools in the northern part of Nigeria since 2010. In 2014, the group audaciously kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in the southern-Borno town of Chibok. Seven years later, more than 100 of the girls, with some 40 estimated to have died, have not been seen. Thousands of other students have been kidnapped since then.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s fighters target women and girls with rape and other sexual violence, amounting to war crimes during raids in northeast Nigeria.\n\nOsai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria, noted, \u201cAs Boko Haram continue their relentless cycle of killings, abductions and looting, they are also subjecting women and girls to rape and other sexual violence during their attacks. These atrocities are war crimes.\n\n\u201cThe targeted communities have been abandoned by the (Nigerian) forces that are supposed to protect them, and are struggling to gain any recognition or response to the horrors they\u2019ve suffered. The Nigerian authorities must urgently address this issue\u201d.\n\nIn the beginning was Boko Haram\n\nBoko Haram was founded in the early 2000s by the late Mohammed Yusuf. The group whose name translates as \u201cwestern education is forbidden\u201d was like Islamist groups that have formed throughout Nigeria\u2019s history, committed to creating an anti-Western state, using violence if necessary.\n\nHowever, throughout Yusuf\u2019s tenure as the group\u2019s leader, Boko Haram sought to achieve its aims largely through peaceful means. From 2002 to 2009, the group supported Ali Modu Sheriff\u2019s bid for governor and was incorporated into his government when he won in 2003. Yusuf\u2019s father-in-law served as Sheriff\u2019s commissioner for religious affairs.\n\nThe group\u2019s founder and leader Mohammed Yusuf, was a fiery Wahhabi preacher who espoused Salafist beliefs.\n\nWahhabi is a label given to those who follow the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, an 18th Century Saudi preacher. Wahabism is a form of Sunni Islam and it is the only officially accepted religion of Saudi Arabia, which brutally suppresses other religious tendencies whether Islamic or non-Islamic. This brand of Islam is particularly intolerant of Shia and Sufi faiths which it considers heretical. The Wahhabis are always referred to as Salafis, and in fact they prefer to be called as such. As a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafis but not all Salafis are Wahhabis.\n\nThe term Salafism did not become associated with the Wahhabi creed until the 1970s. It was in the early 20th Century that the Wahhabis referred to themselves as Salafis. A Salafist is an individual who emphasises the importance of returning to a \u201cpure\u201d Islam, that of the Salaf, the pious ancestors. Salafists advocate literal and to some degree binary interpretation of Islamic teachings as enjoined by Prophet Muhammad and subsequently practised by the early pious predecessors known as the salaf al-salih. Following the salaf is the reason for their self-designation as Salafis.\n\nIn July 2009, the group launched a revolt through coordinated attacks in four locations in northern Nigeria; Bauchi in Bauchi State, Maiduguri in Borno State, Potiskum in Yobe State and Wudil in Kano State. The aim was to trigger the violent creation of an Islamic state. The revolt was ruthlessly suppressed by the army.\n\nYusuf was captured in his parents-in-law\u2019s house in Maiduguri by a unit of the Army\u2019s 21st Armoured Brigade. They handed him to the Nigeria Police. The Nigeria police, allegedly notorious for heavy handedness and extra-judicial killings, summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in the city. Police officials variously claimed that he was shot while trying to escape, or that he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government acknowledged the extra-judicial murder of the Boko Haram founder and promised to investigate the incident. Unsurprisingly, nothing has ever come out of that promise.\n\nBitter at the brutal suppression of their uprising and the unwarranted murder of their leader, Boko Haram began a decade of brutal war against the Nigerian state and innocent people in the region. Today, it has become a war without end.\n\nThe group acquired new leadership under Abubakar Shekau, a Kanuri who had been Yusuf\u2019s deputy. Shekau, according to former US Ambassador to Nigeria and Africa analyst at the Centre for Foreign Relations, John Campbell, \u201cwas a monster, known for his brutal executions that he publicized, his use of women and children as suicide bombers, and his wholesale kidnapping: he orchestrated the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls, more than a hundred of whom remain in captivity. He mastered the politics of terror. He was charismatic and erratic with some education: he deliberately misquoted Abraham Lincoln. He was also a religious leader and drew on the well of Islamic grievance in northern Nigeria to produce a belief system largely regarded as a perversion of Salafist-inflected Islam but one which has spread in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nUnder Shekau, the group swiftly enlarged the deadliness and regularity of its attacks on government and civilian targets in Nigeria, while recruiting from relegated, oppressed, and poor populations across the region. Boko Haram withstood the Nigerian military\u2019s poorly planned, poorly resourced, and half-hearted attempts to beat it back.\n\nA season of sorrow, tears and pain\n\nBoko Haram has since 2009 killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. The UNDP says that nearly 350,000 people have been killed in the North-East since the insurgency against the Nigerian state began.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), some 3,000,000 people have been displaced in the Lake Chad region and about 310,000 Nigerians have become refugees. More than 1,100 people were killed in the first half of 2020, according to Amnesty International, with more than 300 deaths in April alone.\n\nThe group killed at least 967 people in 2017, marginally more than the 910 deaths that were reported in 2016. It has consistently mounted attacks over the years, challenging Mr. Buhari\u2019s claim that the militants had been beaten. It caused 750 security force casualties in 2019 alone, close to double that of any prior year.\n\nIn January 2020, the terrorist group kidnapped Reverend Lawan Andimi, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in Adamawa State, rejected a ransom and executed him that month. That same month, they attacked Michika and later Garkida in Adamawa, killing scores of innocent civilians In February, several buses and trucks carrying passengers were set on fire in Auno, Borno State. The attack killed at least 30.\n\nThe trucks were stranded at a military checkpoint due to a curfew set by the military. In March, the extremists ambushed Goneri village in Yobe State. The attack killed over 50 soldiers. In November 2018, more than one hundred Nigerian soldiers were reported killed in one single attack on an army base in Metele, Borno State. \u201cThe insurgents took us unawares,\u201d said an officer who spoke to Reuters. \u201cThe base was burned with arms and we lost about 100 soldiers. It is a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThat same year, 76 farm workers were slaughtered in rice fields near the village of Zabarmari. Boko Haram said the attack was waged to seek revenge on villagers for seizing the group\u2019s fighters and handing them over to the authorities.\n\nA floundering government\n\nFor a government big on optics and low on solutions, and keen to deodorise the noxious socio-political environment that has pitted the people against an administration that has failed to win the war it claims to have largely or technically won, the President and his officials have consistently doubled down on the lie that Boko Haram has been essentially defeated.\n\nLieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the immediate past and longest serving army Chief, on February 24, 2016, giddily yet falsely announced to members of the once vociferous but now largely noiseless Borno Elders Forum, \u201cwe were given three major tasks and we have made efforts toward achieving two. The first task is to defeat Boko Haram and I want to tell you that as of today Boko Haram has been defeated. When I say defeat, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there won\u2019t be hitches here and there. We have entered the mop-up stage of our operation\u201d.\n\nInformation minister, Lai Mohammed, in 2019 said, \u201cI stand by what I said that Boko Haram is technically defeated. What we are having today is global terrorism where you have the ISIS, ISWAP Al-Qaeda all working together\u201d.\n\nYet, just a year later, he complained that, \u201cterrorists use media and publicity as oxygen and so when they go on this kind of mindless killings, a dying terrorist group will suddenly spring to life. However, we must also understand that we are dealing with terrorists who are financed globally and we also need more support from global partners.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Nigeria had made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with the terrorists, but for one reason or the other we have been denied these platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2020, almost five years after claiming to have largely defeated Boko Haram, Mr. Buhari railed against the people of Borno State after being booed by the residents of the capital city, Maiduguri. He blamed the leaders of Borno communities for not doing enough in terms of cooperation with the military to end the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\n\u201cThis Boko Haram or whoever they are, cannot come up to Maiduguri or its environs to attack without the local leadership knowing\u2026 As the commander in chief, I will deal with the security situation\u201d, he said.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Boko Haram launched a seven-hour assault on a Chadian army base at Bohoma that killed 93 Chadian soldiers, the deadliest-ever attack by Boko Haram on the country\u2019s military forces. In response Chadian President, Idriss Deby, adorned his army fatigues, rallied his forces from all fronts, and ramped up targeted and sweeping air, ground and amphibious operations against the terrorists. Tagged \u2018Operation Boma Anger\u2019, this military campaign was so effective that Boko Haram\u2019s hunted leader, Abubakar Shekau had to release a viral message to his fleeing fighters pleading with them not to run away from the battle but to \u201ctake heart\u201d as God was bigger than the army of Chad.\n\nObviously embarrassed by the tenacity and outcomes of the widely applauded Chadian offensive, Nigeria\u2019s Army Chief of Staff, Tukur Buratai announced that he was relocating to the North-East \u201cwhere he is overseeing and directing the overall operation in the theatre and other Nigerian Army operations across the country\u201d.\n\nTo many analysts, it was abundantly clear that it was the height of the usual government optics, nothing tangible ever came out of that hurriedly assembled relocation ordered by the President.\n\nIn December of that year, having been unable to deliver on his vow to defeat Boko Haram, Mr. Buratai shockingly predicted that Nigeria will most likely continue to suffer terrorist attacks for the next 20 years.\n\n\u201cThis crisis might not end in 20 years, \u201che had said. \u201cWe have achieved a lot of successes but we cannot continue to use the same tactics and achieve different results. It only depends on the level of escalation and the appropriate responses by all stakeholders both civil and military authorities. Also, by both local and international actors. Citizens\u2019 responsibility is equally important and imperative. All must cooperate to contain the lingering insecurity. Let there be collective action and responsibility,\u201d he had said.\n\nPerhaps basking in the euphoria of battlefield successes of 2015 and 2016, the former Nigerian Army Commander had been too quick to declare victory. Watchers of the Nigerian military do remember that in the midst of Nigeria\u2019s election season, and determined to ensure victory at the polls, then President Goodluck Jonathan in early 2015 ordered a renewed military offensive against Boko Haram. Led by then GOC of the 7 Division, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun, the Army began making headway against the group. The Nigerian Military, supported by private military contractors led by Eeben Barlow\u2019s \u2018Specialised Tasks, Training, Equipment and Protection International\u2019, STTEP, seized back most of the territory previously held by Boko Haram.\n\nIn February of that year, Monguno, the local government of Mr. Buhari\u2019s National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno as well as Marte local government were recaptured from Boko Haram. By the time Buhari assumed office in May 2015, practically all the territory under Boko Haram\u2019s control had been taken over by the Nigerian Military and that was why elections took place in all the local governments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in 2015, and Buhari and his party won an overwhelming majority of votes in those states. The Tukur Buratai led Army from August 2015 merely consolidated on the initial victories chalked up by the pre-Buhari administration.\n\nBy mid-2017, the Nigerian Army had begun to lose the initiative and hand back territories to Boko Haram. In February this year, Boko Haram again hoisted its flag in Marte. In June 2020, at least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were said to have been killed in twin attacks on Monguno and Nganzai, that came days after some 81 villagers were killed in Gubio. The loss of territories began with the removal of the Theatre Commander, Major-General Leo Irabor, now Chief of Defence Staff in May 2017 alongside the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, then Brigadier-General Emeka Ezeogwu and their replacement with Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru and Brigadier-General Ibrahim Yusuf, respectively.\n\nImmediate past governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima would later in 2018 decry this inopportune change when as governor he opined that the Boko Haram insurgency regained momentum in 2017 because of the failure of command at the theatre of war. He lamented, \u201cthe change of guard at the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command which saw the replacement of Lucky Irabor, a Major General who is now at the Multinational Joint Task Force, did not help in sustaining the winning spirit of troops,\u201d adding that Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru \u201cdid not give a good account of himself as his tenure as Theatre Commander was greeted by embarrassing attacks on troops and civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian state as the problem\n\nThe contest for political, economic and social power in Nigeria is largely driven by religion in Northern Nigeria, while ethnicity is the basis for power contestation in the South. That is why most violence in the North tends to have religious colourations even if it is really nothing more than a competition over a piece of land.\n\nNigeria has since the 1980s been characterised by varying forms of ethno-religious violence.\n\nBeginning with the Maitasine insurgency between 1979 and 1983 in which between 4000-6000 lost their lives, and trailed by a plethora of successive ethnic, religious and social upheavals in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nigerian state has unenthusiastically dealt with these nihilist insurgencies in a manner that laid the basis for the insurrection against the state by Boko Haram.\n\nSome of the prominent examples include those of the Kasuwan Magani in 1980, Zango Kataf and Gure-Kahugu in 1987, Kafanchan and Lere in 1987, Ilorin and Jerein 1989, Tafawa Balewa in 1991 as well as that of Zango Kataf in 1992, Kaduna in 2000, Jos in 2001. No part of Northern Nigeria has been immune of violence of one religious nature or the other\n\nPerpetrators of religious violence have rarely been brought to justice. There has been a long culture of appeasement of religion by successive Nigerian governments, which has culminated in the emboldening of religious zealots assured of almost a free pass by the Nigerian state. It is common in Nigeria to keep hearing of sponsors of Boko Haram and other violent actors, sometimes coming out of government circles, yet, no one is ever charged or outed. A former security officer agreed that \u201cwhen religious and communal conflicts occur, we tend to look purely at the political dimension without seeking to prosecute and punish criminal actors. Perhaps, if this is consistently done, it would make those who engineer these criminal activities to think twice\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe inability of the Nigerian state to forcefully challenge political religion has led to new theatres of war in the north. This leads to the conclusion that the boldness of these new actors is linked to the government\u2019s inability to deal decisively with the crisis in the north-east.\n\nThus, the battle against Boko Haram can be justifiably termed the battle Nigeria was supposed to fight years and years ago but refused to.\n\nInternational dimension of Boko Haram\n\nIt has been suggested within intelligence circles both in Nigeria and outside, that the unending Boko Haram insurgency has its fibrous roots outside the country. There is ample evidence as consistently stated by the leadership of the United States Africa Command and supported by intelligence reports by Nigeria\u2019s different intelligence services, that Boko Haram has over time received training, funding and logistic support from Islamist elements in Mauritania, Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) as well as from the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab responsible for the recent deadly terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIn March 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Abubakar Shekau, the group\u2019s then leader, said, \u201cWe announce our allegiance to the caliph\u2026 and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity. We call on Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the caliph.\u201d\n\nThus, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) was formed. With its most significant provinces in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nAfrica analyst, Jacob Zenn, noted that, as ISIS faced defeat and began losing its \u201cterritorial caliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, the terror group\u2019s leadership knew that the organisation would have to depend on external \u201cprovinces\u201d (called wilayat) to keep its global project thriving. The provinces would launch attacks and remain loyal to ISIS, and ISIS could claim that the \u201ccaliphate\u201d might no longer be expanding, but it was remaining. With setbacks in Afghanistan and the Philippines, Africa emerged as the only continent where ISIS could operate like it did in Syria and Iraq during its heyday. So long as ISIS thrives in Africa, the dream of the global caliphate remains alive.\n\nNot only can ISIS conduct sophisticated attacks in Africa, it also can occupy territories and overpower armies. Moreover, with rapidly increasing populations, historical narratives about reviving pre-colonial Islamic states, and challenges resulting from weak governance and security forces\u2019 abuses, ISIS finds fertile ground on the continent.\n\nBy June 2019, ISWAP was becoming ISIS\u2019s strongest external province. ISIS\u2019s influence had become so strong in the Sahel and Lake Chad region that it could order the capture and execution of Boko Haram\u2019s leader and one time ISIS ally, Abubakar Shekau.\n\nShekau, one of the most notorious leaders of Islamic militant groups anywhere in the world, died in May after detonating an explosive device while being pursued by fighters from ISWAP. The ISWAP fighters had stormed the Sambisa Forest, a swath of strategically important dense forest in Nigeria\u2019s north-east, which was Shekau\u2019s base.\n\nBulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Reuters after Shekau\u2019s death that Islamic State \u201cis consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and Shekau\u2019s stronghold\u201d.\n\nCorruption benefits Boko Haram\n\nNigeria\u2019s military budgetary allocation is higher than the budgets of all other West African countries\u2019 defence or military operations put together. In 2020, military expenditure for Nigeria was $2,568 billion. Between 2015 and 2020, $11, 881 billion was spent on the military with little accruing to the country by way of peace.\n\nOn the contrary, the frontiers of violence in the country have expanded widely since 2015, as the military have been hampered by an equally dangerous enemy \u2013 corruption.\n\nTransparency International (TI) in a 2014 report noted that Nigerian military officers, politicians and other elites have enriched themselves by diverting money that was meant to fight terror. Since defence makes up 20 percent of Nigeria\u2019s budget, it is an attractive target.\n\nSeven years later, nothing has changed. Two retired army generals agreed that a lot of the budgetary allocations to the armed forces disappeared through bribes, payments to \u201cghost soldiers\u201d who don\u2019t exist, and through contracts not tendered and contested for, resulting in inflated spending that benefits politically-connected contractors.\n\n\u201cIf you want to solve the Boko Haram issue, follow the money\u201d, one said. He added that corruption is the biggest driver of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe lack of an updated, published defence policy weakens the accountability of the whole defence sector and makes scrutiny over defence matters, including budget and acquisition planning, harder.\n\nTransparency International in its 2020 Government Defence and Security report noted that while, \u201cthe annual defence budget is publicly available but the percentage of secret spending related to national security and intelligence services is difficult to establish, and off-budget expenditures are permitted by law, which often allows for non-orthodox practices, such as the \u2018security vote\u2019 to take place\u201d.\n\nIt further noted, \u201cSoldiers\u2019 payments are often irregular and hardly adequate in Nigeria, which has an impact on the motivation of its troops; this increases the likelihood of the phenomenon of the ghost soldiers, which is significant in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nOn corruption as an operational risk to the Nigerian military, the report gathered that, \u201cWhile corruption is recognised as an issue to be addressed within military circles, corruption is not systematically identified at the operational planning stage and is not seen as requiring contingency planning. There is no evidence of systematic corruption risk monitoring during operations.\n\n\u201cThere is provision made for training on issues relating to corruption, but it tends to be ad hoc and the connection between corruption, operational efficiency, and effectiveness could be emphasised further. The engagement of private military contractors in operations is unregulated, nor subject to scrutiny, and its costs are off-budget, meaning that private military contractors have access to significant power in an unregulated manner\u201d.\n\nIt further added that the procurement in the military is fraught with irregularities. Scrutiny, it said over matters of defence procurement \u201cis very limited in Nigeria. The Public Procurement Act excludes sensitive acquisitions relating to defence or security from its purview unless otherwise stated by the President, often resulting in significant expenditure going unscrutinised. Additionally, the lack of an updated defence policy contributes to the hardship in effectively scrutinising the sector\u2019s financial activities; for example, it makes the needs assessment phase of the budget cycle difficult to scrutinise and purchases are often ad hoc, rather than part of a long-term strategic acquisition plan. Information on the defence procurement cycle is not disclosed to the public and the National Assembly and external bodies play a marginal role in overseeing the process. Other unorthodox practices are also widespread, including security votes and single sourcing\u201d.\n\nEnding the war \u2013 What kind of reforms are needed?\n\nThe reality of terrorism and other anti-state violence is the exploitation of the inherent weaknesses in the operational capacity of the military in order to demean the authority of the state and vitiate the legitimacy of the government of the day. A weak security infrastructure certainly means a weak government. What is not in doubt, is that the Nigerian security services; including the military, police and special services, are not fit for purpose, as alleged by many Nigerians. They are operationally deficient, institutionally weak and structurally decayed.\n\nAs aptly noted in a June 2016 Crisis group report, \u201cthe decline began during 33 years of military dictatorship that took a serious toll on professionalism, operational effectiveness and accountability\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian military, which used to be among the continent\u2019s strongest and a backbone of regional and global peacekeeping efforts, has become a blemished force; suffering from an acute readiness crisis. It is overstretched, under-manned, grossly under-equipped, ill-trained, and poorly led. Even more unpleasant is the fact that the three services are locked in intense unhealthy competition, with neither the administrative head of the military (Minister of Defence) nor the operational head (Chief of Defence Staff) able to arbitrate.\n\nThis has resulted in lone wolf approaches to operations; with individual services working in silos rather than in concert, thus imperilling the counterterror/counterinsurgencies campaigns across the country. In addition, this obvious lack of operational and administrative oversight has resulted in the services pursuing prestige projects with no real value to operational capacity, frittering away already hard to get and inadequate resources.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2019, Nigeria\u2019s expenditure on military remained stable at around 0.5 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. In 2019, the military spending amounted to 0.46 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nAfter decades of underfunding the military, Nigeria\u2019s defence budget has increased substantially during the past 10 years. Yet the performance of the country\u2019s military remains poor. And the country\u2019s security challenges continue as can be seen from the latest data from the 2019 Global Terrorism Index report which ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017.\n\nWith this heavy expenditure, why are the outcomes so poor?\n\nAnti-corruption/transparency\n\nIt is more than obvious that the inability to get positive outcomes is due to the never-ending corruption prevalent in the military hierarchy in which budgetary allocations meant for military-centric activities are deployed to procure office goods, services, building structures, and overseas trips. In addition, there is also clear and irrefutable evidence that corrupt and incompetent security chiefs have turned the nation\u2019s security into a \u201cbusiness venture\u201d, thus jeopardising the capacity of the military to access effective and efficient resources and assets to defend the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nTraining and doctrine\n\nThe challenge facing the Nigerian military, as clearly evident over the last decade, is to train a force that is capable of winning wars. The operational environment and the changing Character of warfare necessitate a change in the way officers and men are recruited, trained, deployed and promoted.\n\nIn the conflict against Boko Haram, we have seen whole battalions running away from the battlefield, and cases of soldiers losing their will to fight. While access to efficient equipment has been cited as the main reason for this, it is obvious that it is a secondary reason.\n\nThere is ample evidence that soldiers from Niger, Chad and Cameroon are no better resourced than their Nigerian counterparts, yet they have proved to be more zealous on the battlefield and keener to take risks.\n\nOne of the critical factors responsible for this lethargic approach by the Nigerian military is the methodology for recruiting officers and soldiers, the manner of training and on-boarding, as well as the methodology for deploying and promoting them.\n\nThe Nigerian military has over the years become a \u2018tribal employment portal\u2019 where emphasis is placed on language, tribe and religion at the expense of capability, efficiency and merit.\n\nThe resultant outcome is a large corps of officers and men incapable of securing the country and unwilling to put their \u2018best foot\u2019 forward in the arena of battle. The reason is not hard to fathom; many joined the military not out of patriotism and a willingness to serve, but out of material need for a source of regular income.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to redefine who can become a soldier and how that process takes place. The distorted system of recruitment, postings, transfers, promotions, rewards and punishment needs a complete overhaul to engender patriotism and selflessness and thus, get the best of the best into the military.\n\nFurthermore, the deployment of soldiers for internal security operations such as anti-kidnapping, anti-crime and anti-cultism operations completely negates the training and doctrine as well as the responsibilities of the military.\n\nThe end result has been the erosion of the professionalism of soldiers as well as the vitiation of their distinctive soldierly quality as they get more and more involved in civilian matters.\n\nTo reverse this trend, it is more than important that the Police is encouraged and well-resourced to take on their assigned responsibilities of fighting crime and criminality in order to relieve the military of such extraneous duties that add no value to the capability of the military.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pressing imperative to interrogate the method of appointing the leadership of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Pertinent questions to ask in this regard include: Must ethnicity and religion be the yardstick for determining who heads the varied services or should clear evidence of academic, operations, leadership and management capability be the sensible criteria?\n\nShould course mates and seniors of newly appointed chiefs who aren\u2019t due for retirement be forced to resign, thus depleting the services of well-trained officers and managers. Isn\u2019t it reasonable and more compelling for the country and the military that those who are willing to continue serving be allowed to do so? Shouldn\u2019t service chiefs be constitutionally allowed to serve two terms of two years each in order to insulate them from political influence of the executive leadership? Isn\u2019t there a need to place an embargo on the promotion of senior officers in the military until such a time when the major conflict in the north-east has been decisively won?",

          "title": "Insecurity costs Nigeria $40.6bn worth of investments in 1 year",
          "text": "Over $40.6 billion worth of foreign investments were diverted from the Nigerian economy in 2020 alone as a result of insecurity. This is equivalent to 1.5 percent of global GDP.\n\nNigeria is currently grappling with security challenges ranging from farmer/herder clashes, cattle rustling, banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram insurgency. Boko Haram is translated from Hausa to mean \u201cWestern education is forbidden\u201d.\n\nFor many Nigerians, especially those in the northern part of the country, Boko Haram is associated with the loss of loved ones, property, and means of livelihood. From the findings of the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), Boko Haram is the deadliest terrorist group in the world and their focus is Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nThe terrorist group has caused massive destruction across northern Nigeria in the last decade. Aside from the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014 which made global headlines, many more attacks launched by the group have resulted in several deaths and altered lives forever.\n\nThe atmosphere in and around many towns in North-East Borno State is as tense as ever, as lives and properties are still being taken by the terrorists.\n\nRecently, the state has been ravaged by a deadly conflict between the military and the Boko Haram jihadists. Some time ago, the authorities announced they wanted to close the Borno refugee camps as they claimed the insurgency was almost eradicated. However, in recent months, deadly attacks have taken place on the outskirts of the regional capital Maiduguri.\n\nThe persistent issue of insecurity in Nigeria has been fingered as a major reason behind foreign investors pulling out their investments from the country.\n\n\u201cThe direct costs associated with violence include the immediate consequences on the victims, perpetrators, and public systems including health, judicial and public safety. The indirect cost of violence refers to longer-term costs such as lost productivity and investments, resulting from the physical and psychological effects and the impact of violence on the perception of safety and security in society,\u201d the global peace report indicated.\n\nMichael Ogunremi, a macro-economist and fixed-income analyst at Chapel Hill Denham stated that the current insecurity levels in Nigeria are most likely going to hamper the influx of foreign direct investments considering the unattractive nature of the country\u2019s macroeconomic environment.\n\n\u201cI think insecurity is a serious concern because if I were a foreign investor, I wouldn\u2019t want to visit states like Borno, Kaduna, or most northern states in general. As an investor, the risk perception for investing in those parts of the country seriously outweighs any benefits that can be realised from such a venture,\u201d Ogunremi stated.\n\n\u201cThe major disadvantage of insecurity is that it affects tourism, foreign direct investment, and foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) because there is the make-belief that FPI\u2019s are mostly influenced by interest rates. However, there are also macro-economic sentiments that also come into play in these situations,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIndeed, consumer companies stand to reap the dividends of peace in northern Nigeria if the military can bring to an end the activities of Boko Haram in those regions,\u201d Ogunremi noted.\n\nGrowing insecurity in Nigeria in recent years has coincided with rising poverty levels as the country now has an estimated 91 million people (43% of its population) living in extreme poverty (less than $2 a day). This is up 29 percent from 70 million in 2016 and this is projected to reach 106.6 million by 2030. Nigeria is now regarded as the world\u2019s poverty capital.\n\nThe disruption to lives and livelihoods and the surge in the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) are on the verge of triggering a humanitarian crisis. Many displaced people are being prevented from accessing vital services such as healthcare, and farmers are unable to plant or harvest crops.\n\nIn some cases, armed bandits insist on payments before farmers can have access to farmlands in the planting season. They return during the harvest season and extort farmers before access is granted to their farms. This has led to scarcity and a surge in the prices of certain food commodities.\n\nRead Also: Insecurity frustrates billion-naira interventions in farming\n\nInsecurity\n\nAccording to ReliefWeb, as much as 5.1 million Nigerians are estimated to be at high risk of being critically food insecure between June and November 2021. This situation is exacerbated by the second wave of COVID-19 in which Borno, Adamawa, Yobe States (Boko Haram hotspots) have recorded new cases.\n\nWhat began as localised clashes between farmers and herders over access to land has degenerated into a major conflict and loss of lives across the north. In late 2020, dozens of rice farmers were massacred in Borno State.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Index, Nigeria is the third most terrorised country in the world, after Afghanistan and Iraq. Total terror-related deaths were estimated at 1,245 in 2019 and 1,606 in 2020. Total deaths are estimated at 22,441 since 2001.\n\nAccording to an email sent from the office of the vice president to Bloomberg, it stated that \u201cthe Boko Haram insurgency has caused $9 billion of damage in six northern Nigerian states since 2011.\u201d\n\nThe frequency of these attacks suggests that the battle against the insurgents is far from over. Although military offensive strategies have made significant headway in crippling Boko Haram\u2019s activities, the group, however, appears relentless, and has maintained intermittent attacks and kidnapping.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has made a specific commitment to combat terrorism, but the recent intensified efforts by Boko Haram suggest the goal of restoring peace to the northern region is still a far reach.\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of power, Aliyu Abubakar at a town hall meeting in Maiduguri on Thursday stated that the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) lost N1.7 billion in nine months owing to vandalism of electricity infrastructure in Maiduguri and environs. He added that in one month, TCN lost an average of N139 million on the wheeling charges and energy lost in the area.\n\n\u201cThis misappropriation of funds to vandalised projects rather than our citizens is what is driving the country\u2019s poverty level to record highs,\u201d Abubakar stated.\n\nData from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that Nigeria spent N258.3bn on wheat importation in the first three months of 2021. Recent reports indicate that efforts at boosting local wheat production in recent years have been undermined by the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-Eastern region of the country, as wheat farmers in Borno, the country\u2019s major producing state have abandoned their farmlands and fled to other regions for safety.\n\nPresident of the Wheat Growers Association of Nigeria noted that the insurgency in the North-Eastern region has been a major setback to efforts at increasing wheat production, noting that Borno alone contributed 30 percent to the country\u2019s total output before the insurgency but now contributes nothing.\n\nNigeria remains a net importer of wheat, though there exists a 5 percent tariff on wheat imports, plus an additional 15 percent levy for the national wheat development programme.\n\nBorno, Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, Jigawa, and Zamfara States are major wheat producers and these states are currently undergoing military operations in the fight against terrorists and bandits. These restrictions make it difficult for farmers to access their farms. These unfortunate events have led to a spike in food prices reflected in the food inflation rate and by extension headline inflation.",

In the case of run-up simple majority win the election.\n\n\u201cIn the case of run-up, simple majority wins the election,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe governors also deliberated on the controversy on the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) on which Lagos and Rivers States have made laws and also opposed the position of their southern counterparts.\n\n\u201cAs responsible leaders, while we are constraint by the fact that the matter is subjudice, we however for the purposes of educating the public make the following observations:\n\n\u201cThe judgement of the Federal high Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13% derivation, National Economic Development Council and many other currently levied and collected by the Federal Government of Nigeria, Federal Inlands Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State Governments had enacted their own VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum have expressed support for this course of action;\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these State Government as a sales tax. If every state enacted its own VAT Law, multiple taxation will result in increases of prices of goods and services and collapsed in interstate trade. VAT is not a production tax like excise, but terminal tax which is paid by the ultimate consumer;\n\n\u201cAnother confusion is ignoring observation above and its \u2018overall effect\u2019. The reason Lagos account for our 50% VAT collection is because most of the telecommunication companies, banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in Lagos with the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT\n\n\u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is sub judice and Northern States Governors Forum would respect this,\u201d the statement said",

          "text": "Kaduna, Ekiti, Anambra, and Akwa Ibom States have taken the lead in an open contracting assessment, with a research report showing some high-level transparency in the execution and procurement processes of their projects.\n\nThe assessment report followed a series of desk research and engagement of the state government officials, civil society organisations, and members of the media on how to explore a new forward-looking approach to fiscal transparency in open budgeting and contracting by Public and Private Development Centre (PPDC).\n\nThough the assessment found some lapses that should be addressed by the states, the PPDC open state ranking and report obtained by LEADERSHIP showed that Kaduna State lead the chart as the first in Nigeria to sign the open government partnership in 2017, with commitments to five key areas of open budgeting, open contracting, access to information, citizens engagement and ease of doing business which help development partners, CSOs, NGOs and citizens to advance the cause of fiscal transparency and open data in the state.\n\nThe report noted: \u201cBudgeting and contracting processes have improved because of the Open contracting policies in terms of inclusion and citizen engagement,\u201d the report said, advising State actors and non-state actors to take responsibility for oversight and monitoring.\n\n\u201cThe state government may also wish to domesticate the Freedom of Information (FOI) law to align with its open government principles without which fiscal transparency cannot be achieved. The relationship between the CSOs and the State Legislators is improving as they set a civil society desk office up\u201d.\n\nIt was gathered that open data/budgeting and contracting are driven by political commitment in Ekiti State with political leaders, especially Governor Kayode Fayemi, coming from a civil society background.\n\nThough the report showed that CSOs in Ekiti State have a weak institutional capacity to analyse and interrogate fiscal documents in ways that stimulate government engagement or action, the state has continued to keep its data open and engage citizens via the radio on contracting.\n\nThe report showed that Anambra State, known for entrepreneurship with the most industries and commercial operations in Nigeria\u2019s South East, had a sound and transparent fiscal regime, which has been identified as a guide for efficient and effective allocation of public resources to government priorities, as well as strong support for the efficient delivery of services for poverty reduction and economic development.\n\nThe report suggested that implementing governmental institutions\u2019 policies must be strengthened to ensure successful result in system-wide improvements.\n\nIt added that implementing fiscal transparency reforms based on enabling laws with the state maintaining a functional online platform where budget policies and associated documents are shared with the public in a timely manner helped in Anambra ranking.\n\nThe report further noted that many individuals, private sector companies, and civil society organisations are unaware of the presence of platforms that help in open contracting.\n\nIt said the open contracting portal will require more frequent updates and that the state should fully integrate e-procurement systems to improve the open contracting portal\u2019s functionality.\n\nThe report noted: \u201cAnambra State has a strong fiscal regime with institutions, regulations, and reform champions that can be used to increase efficiency. There is a considerable presence of informed and willing citizen groups that can assist in reform efforts.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is much opportunity for development in the state, particularly in terms of procurement and citizen participation in the entire process, both of which have been noted as areas where gaps exist\u201d.\n\nThe report also said that the Akwa Ibom state government initiated governance reforms aimed at assisting and strengthening existing institutions to effectively allocate, execute, and account for public funds and enacted four laws namely the Fiscal Responsibility Law No. 13 of 2020, the Debt Management Law No. 8 of 2019, the Bureau of Public Procurement Law No. 7 of 2019, and the Revenue Administration Law No. 15 of 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, laws in Akwa Ibom such as the Local Government Administration Law of 2017 and the Audit Law No. 3 of 2021, among others, were previously enacted to support fiscal transparency.\n\nThe report however noted that the state lacks a documented budget calendar or manual that clearly describes the budget process despite the existence of a citizens\u2019 budget committee chaired by the commissioner for Economic Development and Deep Seaport and comprising civil society organisations (CSOs), women, youth, and other community groups.\n\n\u201cThere is also a dedicated email address where citizens can send their budget inputs; however, budget inputs from citizens are rarely taken into account by the State Assembly, owing to the limited time available to review the budget. The budget document as well as the citizens\u2019 budget are publicly available on the State\u2019s official website and that of the budget office.\n\n\u201cAkwa Ibom State has a website for the Auditor-General\u2019s Office where audited accounts are published and this has the latest audited account for the State. Worthy of note also is the fact that there is a dedicated website for procurement, however, this website contains very little information as it concerns procurement,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt revealed that there are bureaucrats who are ready to drive the implementation of fiscal transparency but are often hampered by influences from the political class.\n\nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of Public and Private Development Centre (PPDC), Nkem Ilo, told LEADERSHIP that open contracting can help produce a more transparent and accountable government, as well as encourage synergy between the government and citizens of the nation.\n\nShe said the Open State Ranking is an initiative PPDC utilises to improve state fiscal transparency and hold the government accountable.",

          "text": "Kaduna, Ekiti, Anambra, and Akwa Ibom States have taken the lead in an open contracting assessment, with a research report showing some high-level transparency in the execution and procurement processes of their projects.\n\nThe assessment report followed a series of desk research and engagement of the state government officials, civil society organisations, and members of the media on how to explore a new forward-looking approach to fiscal transparency in open budgeting and contracting by Public and Private Development Centre (PPDC).\n\nThough the assessment found some lapses that should be addressed by the states, the PPDC open state ranking and report obtained by LEADERSHIP showed that Kaduna State lead the chart as the first in Nigeria to sign the open government partnership in 2017, with commitments to five key areas of open budgeting, open contracting, access to information, citizens engagement and ease of doing business which help development partners, CSOs, NGOs and citizens to advance the cause of fiscal transparency and open data in the state.\n\nThe report noted: \u201cBudgeting and contracting processes have improved because of the Open contracting policies in terms of inclusion and citizen engagement,\u201d the report said, advising State actors and non-state actors to take responsibility for oversight and monitoring.\n\n\u201cThe state government may also wish to domesticate the Freedom of Information (FOI) law to align with its open government principles without which fiscal transparency cannot be achieved. The relationship between the CSOs and the State Legislators is improving as they set a civil society desk office up\u201d.\n\nIt was gathered that open data/budgeting and contracting are driven by political commitment in Ekiti State with political leaders, especially Governor Kayode Fayemi, coming from a civil society background.\n\nThough the report showed that CSOs in Ekiti State have a weak institutional capacity to analyse and interrogate fiscal documents in ways that stimulate government engagement or action, the state has continued to keep its data open and engage citizens via the radio on contracting.\n\nThe report showed that Anambra State, known for entrepreneurship with the most industries and commercial operations in Nigeria\u2019s South East, had a sound and transparent fiscal regime, which has been identified as a guide for efficient and effective allocation of public resources to government priorities, as well as strong support for the efficient delivery of services for poverty reduction and economic development.\n\nThe report suggested that implementing governmental institutions\u2019 policies must be strengthened to ensure successful result in system-wide improvements.\n\nIt added that implementing fiscal transparency reforms based on enabling laws with the state maintaining a functional online platform where budget policies and associated documents are shared with the public in a timely manner helped in Anambra ranking.\n\nThe report further noted that many individuals, private sector companies, and civil society organisations are unaware of the presence of platforms that help in open contracting.\n\nIt said the open contracting portal will require more frequent updates and that the state should fully integrate e-procurement systems to improve the open contracting portal\u2019s functionality.\n\nThe report noted: \u201cAnambra State has a strong fiscal regime with institutions, regulations, and reform champions that can be used to increase efficiency. There is a considerable presence of informed and willing citizen groups that can assist in reform efforts.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is much opportunity for development in the state, particularly in terms of procurement and citizen participation in the entire process, both of which have been noted as areas where gaps exist\u201d.\n\nThe report also said that the Akwa Ibom state government initiated governance reforms aimed at assisting and strengthening existing institutions to effectively allocate, execute, and account for public funds and enacted four laws namely the Fiscal Responsibility Law No. 13 of 2020, the Debt Management Law No. 8 of 2019, the Bureau of Public Procurement Law No. 7 of 2019, and the Revenue Administration Law No. 15 of 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, laws in Akwa Ibom such as the Local Government Administration Law of 2017 and the Audit Law No. 3 of 2021, among others, were previously enacted to support fiscal transparency.\n\nThe report however noted that the state lacks a documented budget calendar or manual that clearly describes the budget process despite the existence of a citizens\u2019 budget committee chaired by the commissioner for Economic Development and Deep Seaport and comprising civil society organisations (CSOs), women, youth, and other community groups.\n\n\u201cThere is also a dedicated email address where citizens can send their budget inputs; however, budget inputs from citizens are rarely taken into account by the State Assembly, owing to the limited time available to review the budget. The budget document as well as the citizens\u2019 budget are publicly available on the State\u2019s official website and that of the budget office.\n\n\u201cAkwa Ibom State has a website for the Auditor-General\u2019s Office where audited accounts are published and this has the latest audited account for the State. Worthy of note also is the fact that there is a dedicated website for procurement, however, this website contains very little information as it concerns procurement,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt revealed that there are bureaucrats who are ready to drive the implementation of fiscal transparency but are often hampered by influences from the political class.\n\nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of Public and Private Development Centre (PPDC), Nkem Ilo, told LEADERSHIP that open contracting can help produce a more transparent and accountable government, as well as encourage synergy between the government and citizens of the nation.\n\nShe said the Open State Ranking is an initiative PPDC utilises to improve state fiscal transparency and hold the government accountable.",

          "text": "Pan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, has urged the National Youth Service Corps to allow corps members to serve in their respective home states till security agencies stop the menacing spate of kidnapping and the insecurity in the country.\n\nThe group also challenged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to do all that he said to world leaders at the 76th United Nations General Assembly in New York last week.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, made this known in a statement on Monday, titled, \u2018Buhari Speech At The UN: Afenifere Challenges Buhari To Practice What He Preaches\u2026Calls For The Decentralization Of NYSC.\u2019\n\nWhile reacting to a handbook issued by NYSC to corpers titled, \u2018Security Awareness and Education Handbook For Corps Members and Staff\u2019, Afenifere said by serving in their home states, the chances of corpers being kidnapped would greatly be minimised.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the NYSC handbook, on page 56, advised corps members travelling on \u201chigh-risk\u201d roads to alert their \u201cfamily members, friends and colleagues to have someone on hand to pay off the ransom that could be demanded\u201d in case they are kidnapped.\n\nThe Scheme listed such roads as \u201cAbuja-Kaduna, Abuja-Lokoja-Okene, or Aba-Port Harcourt\u201d roads.\n\nThe NYSC later in a statement denied giving the advice, even when each corps member has the handbook.\n\nReacting, Afenifere said, \u201cSince it has been admitted even by the Federal Government agency that we may need to live by kidnap syndrome as indicated by this NYSC tip, the minimum that the government owes parents and corpers in this regard is to let the youths serve their nation in their respective states.\n\n\u201cThat way, their chances of being kidnapped would greatly be minimized.\u201d\n\nThe group also lamented that the government\u2019s poor handling of kidnapping was what has emboldened the perpetrators to continue in their dastardly acts.Read\n\n\u201cWe call on the government to immediately allow states to transform their respective security networks into state police with all the powers appertaining thereto,\u201d Afenifere stated.\n\nIn recent months, the Abuja-Kaduna, Abuja-Lokoja-Okene and Aba-Port-Harcourt roads have witnessed an unprecedented spate of kidnapping as rampaging bandits waylay travellers, take them hostage until their families and associates pay huge amount of money before releasing them.\n\nStudents have been the most affected by the menacing activities of the unscrupulous elements; and parents of prospective corps members kicking against the posting of their wards to bandits-ravaged states. But despite their objection, thousands of fresh graduates are still being posted to high-risk zones.\n\nA number of corpers have been kidnapped in recent months. The rate of kidnapping on major roads have forced many corps members to abandon road transportation and opt for air transportation to connect their base to their states of posting which is usually outside their geopolitical zone.\n\nKidnapping has become a sordid menace and a lucrative \u2018enterprise\u2019 in Nigeria as the West African nation\u2019s security situation worsens.\n\nMany Nigerians are disappointed in the regime of Buhari, who rode to power on the heels of combating the security challenges plaguing the country in 2015 but the situation seems to have been aggravated in the last six years.\n\nAside from the kidnapping of students and corpers, hundreds of Nigerians have also fallen victims to kidnappers in recent times. Their families have had to part with millions of naira to secure their release after days or even weeks of excruciating pains and agony. However, some families have not been so lucky as the daredevil kidnappers rape and kill their victims even after receiving millions of naira as ransom.\n\nThe Senate had proposed a bill seeking to prohibit the payment and receipt of ransom for the release of any person kidnapped, imprisoned or wrongfully confined.\n\nAccording to the bill, Nigerians who pay ransom to kidnappers and kidnappers who receive ransom risk 15 years imprisonment.\n\nBut many Nigerians had flayed the upper chamber and described the bill as stupid. They noted that the National Assembly should instead focus on ensuring they make laws that guarantee adequate security for every Nigerian.

That verdict prompted Congress and some U.S. states to adopt laws limiting use of the insanity defense.\n\nThe shooting helped launch the modern gun control movement as Brady, who was left permanently disabled, and his wife, Sarah, founded what is now known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.",

          "text": "The debate around the zoning of the presidency ahead of the 2023 elections continued Monday with the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) condemning their southern counterparts over their stance on power shift.\n\nThe NSGF\u2019s position was reached at the end of its meeting with traditional rulers from the region in Kaduna.\n\nReading the 11-point resolution at the end of the meeting, NSGF Chairman, Plateau state Governor Simon Bako Lalong said notwithstanding the position of some northern governors on rotational presidency, the action of the southern top politicians was \u201ccounter-productive, especially as it negates the position of the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern State Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political zones in the South to promote unity and peace in the Nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South.\n\n\u201cThe statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected President shall score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation. In the case of run-up simple majority wins the election,\u201d the governors said.\n\nOpen grazing\n\nOn the ban on open grazing, the Forum asked the federal government to \u201cexpedite action on the well-established National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practised in the North.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing Value Added Tax (VAT) debacle, they said: \u201cThe judgement of the Federal High Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13% derivation, National Economic Development Council and many others currently levied and collected by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State Government had enacted their VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum has expressed support for this course of action.\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these state governments as sales tax. If every state enacted its VAT Law, multiple taxations will result in increases in prices of goods and services and collapse in interstate trade. VAT is not a production tax like excise, but a terminal tax that is paid by the ultimate consumer.\n\n\u201cThe reason Lagos accounts for our 50% VAT collection is that most of the telecommunication companies, Banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in Lagos with the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT.\n\n\u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is subjudice and the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum would respect this,\u201d they said.\n\nOn security, the Forum observed the need for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and northern state governments while noting the success of recent measures.\n\nThey commended the ongoing onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram, especially in the North-east and parts of North-west and the North-central states, and encouraged the Armed Forces and other security agencies to sustain the tempo to bring an end to the menace.\n\nThe Forum also decried the \u201chigh level of conspiracies\u201d being perpetrated by some judicial officers in releasing/granting bail to arrested criminals,\u201d saying, \u201csuch sabotages the fight against criminality, hence, the need to develop \u2018good and robust intelligence mechanism\u2019 amongst states was identified as a panacea.\u201d\n\nPosition not in national interest\n\nA human rights activist in Ondo state, Barrister Morakinyo Ogele has described the outcome of the northern governors and traditional rulers\u2019 meeting as not for the best interest of the nation.\n\nOgele posited that the position of the governors and traditional rulers on issues like zoning of presidency, though not totally constitutional, as being stipulated by the forum, would do harm to the complexities of the nation\u2019s challenges, adding that this issue has always been addressed politically and resolved.\n\nWhile commenting on VAT, Ogele noted that since the matter is before the law court, it is prejudicial discussion on the matter.\n\nOgele, however, implored the forum to jettison ethnicity and join hands with their counterparts across the country at stamping out insecurity that has now been a nightmare to the citizenry, irrespective of their geo-political zones.",

          "text": "Amidst growing insecurity and widespread cases of kidnapping in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, residents have resorted to self-help by forming vigilante groups across the six area councils to ward off armed bandits and kidnappers.\n\nOur investigations in satellite towns and in more than 30 communities located mostly in the outskirts of the metropolis, showed that vigilante groups are now the cardinal means of protecting lives and property of residents, who claimed official security agencies have become grossly inadequate in providing these services.\n\nResidents also said their decision to rely on the services of private security outfits arose from the repeated stringent calls by the leadership of official security agencies in the country and even state governors for citizens to rise up collectively against armed bandits and gun-trotting bandits and kidnappers ravaging their communities, kill, physically assault, rape their women, loot and destroy their properties at will.\n\nMagashi, Masari, others on \u2018self-help\u2019\n\nMinister of Defence Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd), Katsina state Governor Aminu Bello Masari, Afenifere, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group among others, had in recent time urged individuals and communities to defend themselves against the menace of banditry and kidnapping.\n\nAlready, various regions have constituted regional security outfits such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu by the South-west and South-east governors, respectively.\n\nFCT residents heed call\n\nLamenting the incessant killings and cattle rustling in Abaji, kidnappings in Kuje, Gwagwalada, AMAC and Bwari area councils, residents said they were tired of waiting for the police and other security agencies.\n\nThe residents said they have taken the bull by the horns by confronting these miscreants upsetting the peace and order of their respective communities.\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint, Stumaje of Tungan \u2013Maje in Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Salihu Isiaku Na\u2019annabi, said: \u201cAt some point, it became obvious that our security agencies were almost overwhelmed by the activities of insurgents in some parts of the country and therefore were unable to pay adequate attention to and contain miscreants who were invading our communities.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, understandable that the residents of these communities, who were victims and are still at the receiving end of the vicious acts of miscreants, could no longer fold their hands and wait for the overworked security agencies to come to their rescue. We formed vigilante groups across our communities to safeguard our lives and protect our property and halt the frequent rape of our wives and daughters by criminal elements,\u201d the monarch said through the Palace Secretary, Abdulwaheed Salihu.\n\nSimilarly, another monarch and Etsu Giri Kpasere, Chief Dalatu Egari said the communities were prone to attacks by bandits and other criminal elements, hence their decision to opt for whatever legal means to defend themselves against them.\n\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t continue to allow these criminal elements to upset our peace. So, vigilantes seem a good complementary option to assist state security agencies to curb the menace of bandits and kidnappers,\u201d he said through his eldest son, Isah Dalatu Egari.\n\nCorroborating this position, the Odumi of Omoko, Mallam Umar Zozi, whose community is situated along Kwali-Abaji road, said they decided to form vigilante groups because members of the local security outfits know the terrain and can readily confront and contain the bandits and kidnappers\u2019 onslaughts.\n\nKillings and kidnappings in Abuja\n\nIn the last couple of months, a former Army Provost Marshal and Director, Veteran Affairs of the Nigerian Army, Major-General Husseini Ahmed, was killed by an armed gang along Lokoja-Abuja Road.\n\nPrior to that time, a former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh was shot dead following an attack on his vehicle along the Abuja-Keffi road while returning from his farm in Nasarawa state.\n\nSimilarly, unknown gunmen killed two naval officers along the Abuja-Lokoja highway, barely two months after the killing of a top army officer, GSM Abubakar, by suspected bandits along the same road.\n\nAlleged bandits also invaded herders\u2019 settlement and killed a 30-year-old man, Abdulmumin Jagaba, near Sabon-Gari village in Kwali Area Council.\n\nBesides, two herdsmen were killed at Paiko community in Gwagwalada, Kwankashe area in Madalla, another person killed while 12 others, mostly males, were abducted by gunmen.\n\nAlso, at Jikwoyi/Kurudu area of Abuja satellite town, unknown gunmen killed a pastor, identified as Emeka Evans, inside his church during a vigil.\n\nKidnappings\n\nCases of kidnappings in the FCT have mostly occurred at the outskirts of the metropolis except few instances like the kidnapping of Channels Television reporter, Friday Okeregbe and a Punch correspondent, Okechukwu Nnodim, at different times.\n\nHowever, Pegi, Dafara, Gaube, Kiyi, all in Kuje; Mpape, Nuelege, along the Airport road, villages around Bassa near the Nigerian Air Force facility few kilometres away from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, all in AMAC, seem to be the haven of kidnappers who have in the last one year abducted for ransom no fewer than 25 persons. Currently, a mother and her two teenage daughters abducted penultimate Sunday in Pegi are still in the kidnappers\u2019 den as at the time of this report.\n\nWe learnt that abduction for ransom is a regular occurrence in Mpape as people are said to be abducted and the family compelled to pay as paltry as N100, 000, sometimes.\n\nA resident, Ishaku Yamusa, said: \u201cWe live in fear because of the activities of kidnappers who abduct and demand even N100, 000 before the release of their captors. Sadly, these abductions are hardly reported by the media.\u201d\n\nAnother resident in Yaba, Abaji, a farming community which shares border with Niger state, Moses, disclosed that there have been cases of cattle rustling and kidnappings, none of which, according to him, found a space in the media.\n\n\u201cSo forming vigilante groups to checkmate the activities of these vagrant criminals required little persuasion of residents who cherished their safety and peace,\u201d he said.\n\nCommunities visited\n\nIn course of our investigation, we visited Kubwa, Lugbe (the side where VON is located), Aco, Gwagwalada, Bwari, all satellite towns and more than 30 communities, including Yaba in Abaji, Omoko, Ohonu. All the villages along the Airport road, including Ido and surrounding villages opposite the University of Abuja, Kiyi near the Ghana-Nigeria International School, Kuje, Chukun along Kuje \u2013 Gwagwalada road. Dafara, Gaube, Tunga Maje, Anagada, and surrounding settlements along Zuba-Gwagwalada road, Nyanya villages, Karu, Jikwoyi Phases 1- 5, Dakwa and five villages that constitute Garam along Bwari- Kaduna road, as well as villages after the Apo Spare Parts Market.\n\n\u2018Why we armed vigilante groups\u2019\n\n\u201cWithout arming the vigilantes you make them sitting ducks for kidnappers and bandits who are usually heavily armed to slaughter at will. So, it is not about the question of legality but of expediency and the safety of the lives and property of our people,\u201d said the Stumaje of Tungan-Maje.\n\nThe monarch said, in collaboration with the special police taskforce approved by the Zuba Divisional Police command, the vigilante groups in Tunga-Maje have drastically reduced incidences of kidnappings and banditry in recent times.\n\nIn Jikwoyi, Bassa, Anagada, Dakwa, Garam, Abuja @ 30, Pegi, Giri Kpasere, Dutse Alhaji and many others, communities armed vigilante groups with modern and dane guns, machetes, arrows, catapults, and charms, while few buoyant ones even purchase \u2018patrol cars\u2019 for their use.\n\nAlso, residents make monthly contributions ranging from N500 to N2000 per house to pay for the services of the vigilante groups. They are also supported by goodwill from individuals and certain organisations within their localities.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous \u2013Ex-police chief\n\nHowever, a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Wilson Inalegu, while speaking on an AIT programme, decried the development.\n\nHe said arming non-state actors with guns is dangerous to the communities and in fact represents a serious security threat to the country.\n\n\u201cYes, communities are very concerned about the growing activities of bandits and kidnappers that have traumatized the citizens. But arming vigilante groups to complement the efforts of security agencies is dangerous because it may be difficult to regulate the use of arms by the vigilantes, especially when they are not carrying legitimate functions\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are told that the federal government spent billions of naira in training police recruits and cadet officers. If indeed this huge is deployed in the training of officers, why has it not reflected in their performance? Queried a serving police officer in the Central Business District, who does not want to be named.\n\nPolice react\n\nCommenting on the development in an interview with Blueprint, spokesman of the FCT Police Command, DSP Adeh Josephine said: \u201cLet me start by noting that the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is safe and secure. The assertion that there is growing insecurity in the FCT is wrong, misleading and capable of causing unnecessary fear and apprehension.\n\n\u201cAlso, communities are not resorting to self-help as indicated, rather, they have a new sense of awareness that security is everyone\u2019s business and the Police need every cooperation and support the citizens can provide for a safer community.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of community policing, there is nothing wrong, and of course, the law permits the people in an area to come together as groups to form alliance and partnership with the Police deployed to their communities, to inter alia, dissect security issues affecting them and also evolve collective approaches to tackle the threats.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Act 2020 is explicit on this. Vigilante group is just one nomenclature amongst the many groups of people that may decide to come together to assist the police in ensuring effective policing. These groups are not expected to work in isolation but rather under the supervision of the Police. They are also not an alternative means of protecting lives and property in the country.\u201d\n\nOn communities resorting to self-help, the police image maker said: \u201cLike I said, the communities are not resorting to self-help. The Command has since improved on its community engagement effort. We hold town hall meetings to engage community stakeholders. In the meetings, we have every strata of our communities represented, if they have lost faith in the Police, they will not attend. Also, our recent achievements in crime fighting are made possible through community support, trust and collaboration.\u201d\n\nOn the vigilantes carrying weapons, she said: \u201cWe have the firearms Act which stipulates what is permissible as regard, who should possess firearms, the kinds and for what purpose. Anyone who does otherwise contravenes the law. As part of efforts targeted at reclaiming the public space and enhancing public safety, the Command has continued to carry out mop-up of prohibited firearms in the hands of handlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are measures in place to ensure the activities of the vigilante groups or any of such group, is within the confines of the law. For instance, the command holds stakeholders\u2019 meeting regularly where we assess the activities of these groups and resolutions are reached as regard their operations.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Babaji Sunday reassures residents of the Command\u2019s effort to ensure lives and property are well protected in the FCT as our emergency numbers are in circulation within the FCT,\u201d the command added.",

The rental expenses incurred by the Board on a yearly basis runs into several millions of naira and currently consumes a larger percentage of the Board\u2019s Overhead budget. This trend is unsustainable. Hence, my quest to build additional accommodation blocks for officers and non-commissioned officers of the Board.\n\n\u201cToday, we are going to witness the commissioning of 2 blocks of 8 x one Bedroom transit apartment for officers and 5 blocks of 16 x One self-contained room for non-commissioned officers. May I seize this opportunity to inform this gathering that the construction of some of these accommodation blocks was initiated by previous administrations at the MPB? To former Chairmen of the Board present here today, we say thank you for your vision and sacrifice in laying the foundation culminating to this commissioning ceremony\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIt also became imperative to build some support facilities in anticipation of accommodating more personnel and their families within the MPB Complex. To this end, a multipurpose minimart was constructed. The minimart comprises a mini supermarket, a Unisex saloon, a laundry shop and a relaxation area for non-commissioned officers.\n\nIt is pertinent to inform the SGOH and other distinguished guests that the minimart would be managed by the Military Pensions Board Officers Wives Association (MPBOWA) to support the Internally Generated Revenue efforts of the Association.\n\nOn payment of pension as at when due, the Chairman said that, \u201cIt is on record that since my assumption of duty in September last year, our esteemed pensioners have received their monthly pensions before the end of each month. Similarly, gratuities of all retirees who retire from Service as at July 2021 and whose retirement documents have been received at the Board have been paid. We have also ensured payments of death benefits to NOKs of deceased personnel who have been recommended by the Services and cleared as genuine NOK by the MPB NOK Committee. In addition, I am happy to inform that all retirees are presently being paid in accordance with the new pension chart wef May 21 as approved by the Federal government\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Special Guest of Honour and Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Zubairu Gambo, commended the plan to transmute to electronic verification for pensioners, noting that it will eliminate menace of pensioners.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cpermit me to state that the plan by the MPB to embark on electronic verification of military pensioners to replace the manual system is a laudable initiative. It is envisaged that the Electronic Verification of military pensioners would resolve the challenges experienced in the existing manual system.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it would lead to substantial financial savings to the Federal Government of Nigeria through progressive elimination of ghost or deceased pensioners while also eliminating the stress the senior citizens endure during manual verification exercises. The Chairman, You have our full support on this new initiative\u201d.",

Obviously, the elite will survive in any way but the vast majority of our people will not.\n\n\u201cSo, I will urge that we should as much as possible do whatever we can in our spaces that we occupy to keep emphasizing that we cannot afford a situation where the national unity of this country is compromised or where the country is made the theater of conflict and all sorts of insurgencies and crimes.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the President of the union, Mr Isiguzo commended the initiatives of the Buhari administration in the areas of employment opportunity creation, skills training for the youth, among others.\n\nHe said in acknowledgment of its role in the society, the union has over the years \u201cengaged in training and retraining of Journalists with assistance from various development partners to build the capacity of journalists to effectively bring to public attention humanitarian situations in the country in a fair manner, honestly, and constructively.\u201d\n\nMr Isiguzo noted that the union frowned against fake news and would do everything in its powers to check the menace, calling on \u201cjournalists to be careful not to be tempted into propagating fake news by ensuring proper and adequate checks before stories are written and transmitted for public consumption.\u201d\n\nThe NUJ president also restated the call for a bailout fund to be provided for the media industry, noting that many media houses are forced to cut salaries or lay off their workers because of the increasing difficulty to sustain operations.\n\nNational executive members of the union present at the meeting include the Deputy President, Alhaji Mukhtar Gidado; National Secretary, Shuaibu Leman; President of the National Association of Women Journalists, (NAWOJ), Ladi Bala; FCT Chairman of the union, Mr Emmanuel Ogbeche, among others.\n\nLaolu Akande\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity\n\nOffice of the Vice President\n\n27th September 2021",

Kelly, the R&B superstar known for his anthem \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d was convicted Monday in a sex trafficking trial after decades of avoiding criminal responsibility for numerous allegations of misconduct with young women and children.\n\nA jury of seven men and five women found Kelly, 54, guilty of all nine counts, including racketeering, on their second day of deliberations. Kelly, wearing a face mask, remained motionless, eyes downcast as the verdict was read in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the entourage of managers and aides who helped Kelly meet girls \u2014 and keep them obedient and quiet \u2014 amounted to a criminal enterprise. Two people have been charged with Kelly in a separate federal case that\u2019s pending in Chicago.\n\nKelly was also convicted of criminal counts accusing him of violating the Mann Act, which makes it illegal to take anyone across state lines \u201cfor any immoral purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the victims in this case, your voices were heard and justice was finally served,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis said.\n\nPeter Fitzhugh, a Homeland Security investigations agent, said the verdict brought an end to Kelly\u2019s \u201cdecade-long reign of terror over many vulnerable girls, boys and young women.\u201d\n\nKelly faces up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for May 4.\n\nKelly lawyer Deveraux Cannick said he was disappointed by the verdict.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m even more disappointed the government brought the case in the first place given all the inconsistencies,\u201d Cannick said.\n\nSeveral accusers testified in lurid detail during the trial, alleging that Kelly subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage.\n\nGloria Allred, a lawyer for some of Kelly\u2019s accusers, said that of all the predators she\u2019s gone after \u2014 a list including Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 \u201cMr. Kelly is the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cR. Kelly thought that he could get away with all of this, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d Allred said outside the courthouse. \u201cDespite the fact that he thought he could control all this, he was wrong.\u201d\n\nFor years, the public and news media seemed to be more amused than horrified by allegations of inappropriate relationships with minors, starting with Kelly\u2019s illegal marriage to the R&B phenom Aaliyah in 1994 when she was just 15.\n\nHis records and concert tickets kept selling. Other artists continued to record his songs, even after he was arrested in 2002 and accused of making a recording of himself sexually abusing and urinating on a 14-year-old girl.\n\nWidespread public condemnation didn\u2019t come until a widely watched docuseries \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d helped make his case a signifier of the #MeToo era, and gave voice to accusers who wondered if their stories were previously ignored because they were Black women.\n\nAt the trial, several of Kelly\u2019s accusers testified without using their real names to protect their privacy and prevent possible harassment by the singer\u2019s fans. Jurors were shown homemade videos of Kelly engaging in sex acts that prosecutors said were not consensual.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Maria Cruz Melendez argued that Kelly was a serial abuser who \u201cmaintained control over these victims using every trick in the predator handbook.\u201d\n\nThe defense labeled the accusers \u201cgroupies\u201d and \u201cstalkers.\u201d\n\nCannick questioned why the alleged victims stayed in relationships with Kelly if they thought they were being exploited.\n\n\u201cYou made a choice,\u201d Cannick told one woman who testified, adding, \u201cYou participated of your own will.\u201d\n\nKelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, has been jailed without bail since in 2019. The trial was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and Kelly\u2019s last-minute shakeup of his legal team.\n\nWhen it finally started on Aug. 18, prosecutors painted the singer as a pampered man-child and control freak. His accusers said they were under orders to call him \u201cDaddy,\u201d expected to jump and kiss him anytime he walked into a room, and to cheer only for him when he played pickup basketball games in which they said he was a ball hog.\n\nThe accusers alleged that they also were ordered to sign nondisclosure forms and were subjected to threats and punishments such as violent spankings if they broke what one referred to as \u201cRob\u2019s rules.\u201d Some said they believed the videotapes he shot of them having sex would be used against them if they exposed what was happening.\n\nAmong the other more troubling tableaus: Kelly keeping a gun by his side while he berated one of his accusers as a prelude to forcing her to give him oral sex in a Los Angeles music studio; Kelly giving several accusers herpes without disclosing he had an STD; Kelly coercing a teenage boy to join him for sex with a naked girl who emerged from underneath a boxing ring in his garage; and Kelly shooting a shaming video of one alleged victim showing her smearing feces on her face as punishment for breaking his rules.\n\nSome of the most harrowing testimony came from a woman who said Kelly took advantage of her in 2003 when she was an unsuspecting radio station intern. She testified he whisked her to his Chicago recording studio, where she was kept locked up and was drugged before he sexually assaulted her while she was passed out.\n\nWhen she realized she was trapped, \u201cI was scared. I was ashamed. I was embarrassed,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said one of R. Kelly\u2019s employees warned her to keep her mouth shut about what had happened.\n\nOther testimony focused on Kelly\u2019s relationship with Aaliyah. One of the final witnesses described seeing him sexually abusing her around 1993, when Aaliyah was only 13 or 14.\n\nJurors also heard testimony about a fraudulent marriage scheme hatched to protect Kelly after he feared he had impregnated Aaliyah. Witnesses said they were married in matching jogging suits using a license falsely listing her age as 18; he was 27 at the time.\n\nAaliyah, whose full name was Aaliyah Dana Haughton, worked with Kelly, who wrote and produced her 1994 debut album, \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing But A Number.\u201d She died in a plane crash in 2001 at age 22.\n\nIn at least one instance, Kelly was accused of abusing a victim around the time he was under investigation in a child pornography case in Chicago. He was acquitted at trial in 2008.\n\nFor the Brooklyn trial, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly barred people not directly involved in the case from the courtroom in what she called a coronavirus precaution. Reporters and other spectators had to watch on a video feed from another room in the same building.\n\nThe New York case is only part of the legal peril facing the singer. He also has pleaded not guilty to sex-related charges in Illinois and Minnesota. Trial dates in those cases have yet to be set.",

          "text": "The Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) has condemned statements by their Southern Governors Forum (SGF) that the Presidency must go to the South in 2023.\n\nIn a communique issued at the end of their joint meeting with Northern Traditional Rulers on Monday in Kaduna, the governors also spoke on the on-going controversy over the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), declaring that it is \u201cbeing confused by Rivers and Lagos state governments as a sales tax.\u201d\n\nThe communique which was read by the chairman of the forum and governor of Plateau state, Mr. Simon Lalong, also said the position of the Southern governors on power shift \u201cis quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended.\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern States Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political Zone in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the Nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemn the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South\u201d, the communique said.\n\nAccording to the NSGF, the statement by the Southern Governors \u201cis quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that an elected President shall: score the majority votes; score at least 25 per cent of the votes cast in two-third of the states of the federation.\u201d\n\nThe communique said the meeting considered the on-going national debate on the collection of VAT, stating however that: \u201cas responsible leaders while we are constraint by the fact that the matter is sub judice we however for the purposes of educating the public make the following observations: the judgement of the Federal High Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13% derivation, National Economic Development Council and many other currently levied and collected by the Federal Government of Nigeria, Federal Inlands Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State Government had enacted their own VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum have expressed support for this course of action;\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these state governments as a sales tax \u201d\n\nThe governors argued further that, \u201cIf every state enacted its own VAT Law, multiple taxation will result in increases of prices of goods and services and collapse in interstate trade.\n\n\u201cVAT is not a production tax like excise, but terminal tax which is paid by the ultimate consumer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governors, \u201cAnother confusion is ignoring observation above and its \u2018overall effect\u2019. The reason Lagos account for 50% VAT collection is because most of the telecommunication companies, banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in Lagos with the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT.\u201d\n\nThe communique said, \u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is sub judice and Northern States Governors Forum would respect this.\u201d\n\nThe governors also decried what they described as \u201cthe high level of conspiracies being perpetrated by some judicial officers in releasing or granting bail to arrested criminals, maintaining that \u201cthis attitude sabotages the fight against criminality.\u201d\n\nThe governors reviewed security situation in the north and called for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and the Northern States governments to tackle the situation.\n\nThe meeting also noted with concern the constraint of the security services and urged the Armed Forces to embark on simultaneous operations and resolved to share the plans of the frontline states come up with and assured of their readiness to work in synergy with the Federal Government in finding lasting solution to the current security challenges.\n\nThe governors commended the ongoing onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram especially in the North East and parts of North West and North Central state States and urged the Armed forces and other security agencies to sustain the tempo.\n\nThe governors called on agencies to leave up to their responsibility and urged traditional rulers to mobilize their various communities in checkmating the ugly trend of criminality in their domains.\n\nThe governors also lamented the ugly trend in the spread of drugs and consumption amongst the teeming youth and called on governments and communities to raise to the occasion by stemming the tide.\n\nThe communique urged the federal government to expedite action on the well establish National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practice in the North.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the governors of Plateau, Kaduna, Sokoto, Nasarawa, Borno, Jigawa, Gombe and the deputy governor of Kano state.\n\nAlso at the meeting was the Chairman of the Northern Traditional Rulers Council, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, the emir\u2019s of Zazzau, Bauchi and Kano among others.\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna",

But the federal government under President Buhari has not only been ignoring them but hounding those calling for such dialogue.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is interesting, perhaps comforting that the Nigerian authority realizes that dialogue is the way to go in resolving knotty issues. It is however hypocrisy of the highest order for this same authority to be prescribing this to foreign authorities while describing those calling for the same thing at home as \u2018hate speech makers\u2019 and separatists.\u201d\n\nAfenifere insisted that the reform that the President advocated for the United Nations is the same thing those calling for dialogue at home are calling for, saying \u201cWhy and how our president considered reform and dialogue as necessary at the global level but consider same as anathema in Nigeria beats one\u2019s imagination.It is called Reform at the global level and Restructuring at home.\u201d\n\nOn internal security, Ajayi said the reality on ground belies the president\u2019s claim that terrorists have more or less surrendered to the Nigerian army.\n\n\u201cWe, as Afenifere, commends the heroic efforts of the Nigerian Army but it is a fact that activities of terrorists appear to be more expanding rather than receding going by the submission of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, that over 330,000 Nigerian refugees are languishing in neighbouring countries due to insurgency and armed banditry in the North East and North West as well as Kaduna State Governor El Rufai that advocated for the military to be decentralized.\n\n\u201cThe level of insecurity in the country has gotten so bad that the authority of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) advised youth corpers to always let their people prepare ransom to be paid in case they are kidnapped in course of traveling from one point to another while in service.\u201d\n\nAjayi insisted that nothing else could underscore the unfortunate level to which insecurity in the country has fallen than the advise by the NYSC, stating that this calls for youth corpers to serve the nation in their respective states at least for now.\n\n\u201cSince it has been admitted even by federal government agency that we may need to live by kidnap syndrome as indicated by this NYSC tip, the minimum that the government owes parents and corpers in this regard is to let the youths serve their nation in their respective states. That way, their chances of being kidnapped would greatly be minimized\u201d, he said.\n\nAfenifere lamented that the kid glove with which the government has been handling the issue of kidnapping was what has been emboldened the perpetrators to continue in their dastardly acts.\n\n\u201cWe call on the government to immediately allow states to transform their respective security networks into state police with all the powers appertaining thereto\u201d, Ajayi added.\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan",

Biden said the first lady, who\u2019s 70, would also receive the booster dose, but she was teaching on Monday at Northern Virginia Community College, where she is a professor of English.\n\nSpeaking on Friday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer booster, Biden told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to acknowledge I\u2019m over 65, but I\u2019ll be getting my booster shot.\u201d He repeated the joke about being over 65 on Monday.\n\nBiden emerged as a champion of booster doses in the summer, as the U.S. experienced a sharp rise in coronavirus cases from the more transmissible delta variant. While the vast majority of cases continue to occur among unvaccinated people, regulators pointed to evidence from Israel and early studies in the U.S. showing that protection against so-called breakthrough cases was vastly improved by a third dose of the Pfizer shot.\n\nBut the aggressive American push for boosters, before many poorer nations have been able to provide even a modicum of protection for their most vulnerable populations, has drawn the ire of the World Health Organization and some aid groups, which have called on the U.S. to pause third shots to free up supply for the global vaccination effort.\n\nBiden said last week that the U.S. was purchasing another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 for a total of 1 billion over the coming year \u2014 to donate to less well off nations.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, 56, received the Moderna vaccine, for which federal regulators have not yet authorized boosters \u2014 but they are expected to in the coming weeks. Regulators are also expecting data about the safety and efficacy of a booster for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot soon.\n\nAt least 2.66 million Americans have received booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine since mid-August, according to the CDC. About 100 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 through the Pfizer shot. U.S. regulators recommend getting the boosters at least six months after the second shot of the initial two-dose series.",
