My answer is legally no, and the reason is that the constitution is clear, the constitution says every Nigerian of 40 years is entitled to aspire for that office.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, morally is it right? Is it an entitlement? I will say yes because the federal character principle enshrined in the constitution encourages rotation.\n\n\u201cThe reason I have to make this clarification is that when the right you have is not legal, the only approach and the instrument you have is persuasion.\n\n\u201cSo the approach, the language will be to persuade others to see reason with you that morally they should support you to take a turn since it rotates.\u201d\n\nAnyim therefore encouraged the Southeast that as they go ahead with the movement of advocating for a president, it should be with an attitude of persuasion.\n\nCorroborating Ayim, Ezeife said that one of the ways to get into power was for the South-Easterners to beg every other region for the presidential seat for 2023.\n\nEzeife stated, \u201cSo I found Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and other groups in this place talking about the need for federal character. If you do it that way, there will be unity, if there is fairness, equity, justice, you will have unity and progress.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of those, you see where we are now. It is not a matter of give us president, we don\u2019t give, you have to work for it, the Igbo does not prostrate.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man does not kneel down but this time, we are prepared to kneel down to every part of Nigeria, every group, every ethnic group in Nigeria, we are prepared to even prostrate because we believe in this country.\u201d\n\nEzeife said that Igbo people had contributed greatly to the development of Nigeria in terms of infrastructure, intellect and business.\n\nHe therefore said that it was time to give Igbo people the chance to build Nigeria to the standard God wanted it.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The two-week free training programme for graduate Engineers and Technologists from the South East geo-political zone on sustainable water technology and renewable energy resources by Fordmarx Nigeria Limited and its foreign partner, Lorentz Germany, in collaboration with Enugu State Government, ended yesterday with expression of gratitude and accomplishment from the participants.\n\nThe free training tagged: \u201cTrain the Trainer/Capacity Building Programme on Sustainable Water Technology\u201d was flagged off by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on November 23, 2021 at The Base Event Centre, Enugu.\n\nRepresented by his Special Adviser on Water Resources, Anthony Dubem Onyia (Jnr.), Gov. Ugwuanyi explained that the programme was intended to build capacity for sustainable water technology especially in the area of borehole drilling, water treatment and plant management, renewable energy, irrigation and fire fighting.\n\nThe governor urged the participants to pay attention and utilize the ample opportunity to learn more about their areas of interest, and commended Fordmarx Nigeria Limited for the programme which he said was the first of its kind in Enugu State.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the two-week programme, the Managing Director of Fordmarx Nigeria Limited, Dr. Clifford Nnaji, explained that the training was initiated to expose the participants to the modern ways of doing things in terms of installation, maintenance and designing of solar power system, renewable energy, water supply, water treatment and plant and fire fighting.\n\nDr. Nnaji said that the event was successful and impactful, pointing out that the participants were happy and satisfied with the training they received.\n\n\u201cThey will go back to their various communities and train others, transfer that knowledge they have acquired here to other people to make sure that potable water is available for everybody in their communities, South East and Nigeria in general\u201d.\n\nThe Fordmarx MD, who disclosed that Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration has been supportive, added that \u201cthe state government has been doing a wonderful job to ensure that we build capacity for leaders of tomorrow\u201d.\n\nReacting at the end of the programme, a cross section of the participants described the event as the first of its kind in Enugu State in particular and the South East in general and thanked Fordmarx Nigeria Limited and Enugu State Government immensely for the initiative, which they said was innovative, engaging and impactful.\n\nOne of the participants, Emmanuel Okona, disclosed that the programme taught them how to harness water as well as how to drill and treat water using modern technology without altering the environment \u201cwith regards to the carbon and decarbonization agenda of the world\u201d.\n\nAccording to him \u201cThis training has opened our eyes to make us understand to a larger extent that water is not just water; that water that is not potable is not safe for any domestic activity.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt that water is not just used for domestic activities; water is used for industrial, commercial and very wide-range of activities in the society. So you can say that water is a very important aspect of human living.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely thank and commend Fordmarx Nigeria Limited for collaborating with Enugu State Government to give us this programme as part of the company\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of giving back to the society.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good initiative for Enugu State Government to partner a big company like Fordmarx to train us. I mean what a better way to give back to the society than to train the youth, young engineers who will take over the industry tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThe participant who noted that the Enugu State government has been proactive in addressing the issue of potable water for the citizens to enjoy sufficient supply, said: \u201cWe know about a lot of programmes they have been doing in the villages. Even in my own village, Akpugo in Nkanu West Local Government Area there is a EN-RUWASSA project there and a lot of other villages.\n\n\u201cAlso in the course of the training, we were taken to some of the facilities the Enugu State Government contracted Fordmarx to develop for them such as the 9th Mile Borehole Crash Programme which involves the total rehabilitation and conversion of so many industrial boreholes to solar power to ensure sufficient and sustainable water supply to Enugu residents.\n\n\u201cThere at the site, you will see the wondrous work the state government is doing to tackle the water problem that we are facing in the city for so many decades.\n\n\u201cSo, on behalf of other participants, I must commend Enugu State Government and the company (Fordmarx) because it is a very big plus for us the participants to come close and learn a lot about water techniques\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, the representative of Network of Civil Society Organizations, Okechukwu Umeh, maintained that the training was \u201cone of the most impactful programmes that I have seen organized that tend to address the global core challenge of climate crisis\u201d.\n\nUmeh added that \u201cthe programme has come to also address the issue of job creation\u201d, stating that \u201cwe have observed a lot of empowerment programmes held by Enugu State Government\u201d.\n\nAnother participant, Osita Ogwacha from Imo State equally appreciated Enugu State Governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his efforts in tackling the challenge of unemployment in the state through various innovative training and empowerment programmes.\n\nHe described the training organized by Fordmarx Nigeria Limited as a veritable opportunity for participants who are graduates in engineering fields to come together, learn and try to proffer solutions to water problems in the country.\n\nIn her reaction, Juliet Udakwu, a beneficiary, revealed that the training has spurred her to develop interest in renewable energy.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t have any intention of going into renewable energy resources but after this training programme, I discovered that there are a lot of things I can do concerning these renewable energy resources.\n\n\u201cI have learnt a lot through this training and I am grateful to Fordmarx Nigeria Limited for orgainsing this programme. I must applaud the Enugu State government because this is a wonderful project. As the theme of the programme reads: \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d, after here we will go out there to train others; what we have learnt here, we will educate others and correct the mistakes they make during drilling and other related activities\u201d.",

          "title": "2023: S\u2019West APC govs begin consultations",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nAhead of the 2023 presidential poll, governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and some other leaders in the Nigeria\u2019s South West have begun critical consultations for the zone to produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor. Impeccable sources mentioned five of the six governors in the zone that have authorised their close aides to move round the Yorubaland and Nigeria to ensure that the 2023 presidency comes to the South West.\n\nThe five governors are Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Gboyega Oyetola, Osun State, Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo State and Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde might not have been part of the meeting since he belongs to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAlready, National Leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as well as the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, are strongly believed to be eyeing the number one political office in 2023.\n\nThough the trio have not come out to make definite statements that they want to run for president, their supporters have, however, made clarion calls to them at different times to openly declare their ambition to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Some have even gone ahead to print and paste posters for the three of them.\n\nA meeting was held in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital earlier in the week to perfect strategies to actualise two major items \u2013 that the president must come from the South West in 2023, and to know the acceptable person that the Yoruba would present for the office. The meeting was held under the aegis of Next Level Consolidation Forum, being chaired by a frontline politician, Chief Oladipo Oladosu.\n\nThere were representatives of the governors of the six South-West states as well as other dignitaries at the meeting. Attendees include Mr. Adekunle Olayinka, an engineer and Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN); Victor Kolade, Special Adviser to the Ekiti State governor on Social Investment Programmes (SIP); and Adesina Popoola, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State. Chief Oladipo Oladosu stood for Osun at the meeting, while Ondo and Oyo were also represented.\n\nThe forum concluded that with the level of academic, economic, social and political prowess that Yorubaland has produced, it would not be fair for the race to present only one person for the job. They added that more people that have interest for the 2023 presidency in the zone should come out and join the presidential race.\n\nOladosu contended that Nigeria would cease to exist if the presidential power failed to rotate to the South-West, saying: \u201cIt is not a threat. It is going to happen.\u201d\n\nBut the SSA to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Adesina Popoola, said: \u201cWe are here because of Yoruba presidential agenda. All of us are here for a purpose and for good precedence in 2023. What we are clamouring to do is that we don\u2019t want this to go to the North, or South East. We want it to go to South-West.\n\n\u201cThe present president is from the North. All of us want this to come to the South and for Yoruba as a whole. We are not talking about the East now. We are talking about South West. If we bring it home, the Yoruba agenda, we can say this is the person we have all agreed on to be the next president in 2023. The agenda is just a small thing. We need somebody that can change Nigeria. We need a good leader at the presidency in 2023, to turn around the country positively. We are here for one agenda, which is we want Yoruba to be president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have not mentioned anybody now. But we know some people will knock on the door and we will know the person. We will open the door for him when the time comes. We are here to support Yoruba. We need the cooperation of all the Yoruba. We knew what happened to Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief MKO Abiola when they wanted to become president of this country. Now, we want all Yoruba to speak with one voice. Then, it will be difficult for enemies to divide us.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Ekiti State Governor on Social Investment Programmes (SIP), Victor Kolade, said also lent his voice to the discourse. According to him, \u201cWe are here today for the future of everybody, and our children, and the future of everything that concerns us. In the last eight years, APC has been in the saddle and we are looking for a better leadership and we hope, we know and we pray that APC from South West will provide that better leadership.\n\n\u201cOur aims and objectives are to make sure, first of all, that every other part of Nigeria concedes the presidency to the South West. That is what we have to work upon, and we are doing that already. I pray that we will be able to accomplish that.\n\n\u201cIf we do that, that is 50 per cent success. Then, the next thing we have to do is, how do we go about it? We are all party men; we know how the party machineries work. We know that your vote, your decision is in the ward level, even they are in the units. So, we have to work. If you have a friend in the North and you have political associates in any part of Nigeria, we have to work together to make sure that a favourable candidate emerges from the South West during the national convention.\n\n\u201cIf we are interested in a particular candidate among those people that showed interest in the South West, we have to work towards it, so that we just don\u2019t assume. At the end of the day, the Northerners preferred to anoint a candidate for us. It has happened once. It has happened several times in the past. If we have anything against that, if we don\u2019t want that, we had to work. But thank God, we are back at the blocs again, and we are hoping for a South Western presidency.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN), which is South West Affairs, Adekunle Olayinka, also observed: \u201cOf course, it is part of my portfolio to make sure that the South West is rock solid, not only in infrastructural development and socio-economic, and all the stuff, but in politics also. That is why we try to ensure that it is not negotiable, as far as we are concerned, that presidency comes to the South West. We have been doing a lot of programmes in that respect.\n\n\u201cWe have gone all over the South-West. We have met the likes of Chief Bisi Akande, our governors, and other leaders. We have sold the idea to them that it is not negotiable, that in their meetings and conversations with other governors throughout the country, that the presidency for South West Nigeria is non-negotiable. I think everyone understands now.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here in Ibadan to have a meeting, whereby our structures will be formalised. Apart form the national structure that has been working all over Nigeria, we want to ensure that our structures are formalised from the ward level to the local government, to the zone, so that we can all put our thoughts together, and put all our resources together to ensuring that we produce a president that will come from the South West.\n\n\u201cWhy? We have the capability. We have the technical know-how. We have economic power. We have the intellectual know-how. So, we believe that no other region, especially now, is better than us producing the presidency.\n\nWe are going to work and ensure that all our youth are energised and they are energised already. They are waiting for our leaders to come out and proclaim that they are running. All we are doing now is consultation and all the stuff, encouraging more of our leaders to even come out. The better the soup, the better the taste becomes.\n\n\u201cI want to foresee in the next couple of weeks that other leaders that have not even proclaimed that they want to contest would come out. Then, we can now say this is the best among them. I don\u2019t think we are going to have any problem in selecting one of our leaders to become our president, and it has to come from South West.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Ogbonnaya Ndukwe, Aba and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nIuminary, Chief Mike Ahamba, has advised those seeking political solution to the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to look the way of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThis is as Igbo Lawyers Association (ILA) has vowed to fight for and defend the fundamental rights of Kanu, who is currently facing trial over alleged sedition.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAhamba said it was only the office of the Attorney General, after due diligence, that can approach a court to stop further prosecution in a matter.\n\nThe Senior Advocate of Nigeria said the denial of the detained IPOB leader from changing his clothes and exercising his rights while in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) were against the law.\n\nAn emergency court sitting on Wednesday had, among others things, ordered that Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility, and also be allowed a change of clothing and free practice of his Jewish faith, including access to his Jewish religious materials.\n\nThe court further ordered that the DSS obey all previous orders granted in the matter, including allowing Kanu any visitor of his choice and that the IPOB leader be permitted, at his option, to mingle freely with other inmates or any other persons at the detention facility.\n\nReacting to the development, Ahamba noted that the AGF as well as the judge handling the case had all agreed on some fundamental issues.\n\nHe said that it was a fundamental right of any detainee in custody to be allowed to exercise certain rights that will not infringe on the final determination of the case for which he was being held, and called on Kanu\u2019s custodians to accord him same in line with the directives of the trial judge.\n\nHe, however, advised Igbo leaders seeking his release, to prepare well for a possible discussion with the Federal Government on what they will offer in return. \u201cThey have to be prepared to assure the government that there would be peace and the things that made for destruction of lives and properties in the South-East would not reoccur when he gets released.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered so much in this area due to the issues at stake. The question will be whether those asking for his immediate release will be prepared to urge him to drop the demands that are causing the problems in the South-East?\n\n\u201cThe President has no power to stop an ongoing matter in the court. Only the Attorney General of the Federation can approach a court to apply for \u201cnon prosecui\u201d, on being sure that such matter will not cause problem in future.\n\n\u201cWe must tell ourselves the truth on what is happening and ask ourselves what we will gain from them,\u201d he stated. He then urged Ndigbo to be wary of actions they take in order that such acts do not come back to haunt and destroy them in future.\n\nChairman of ILA, Chief Chuks Muoma (SAN) told Saturday Sun that Kanu had not committed any offence and should not be treated as a common criminal. He stressed that even the worst of suspected criminals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Mouma maintained that political solution remains the best option in solving the Kanu issue.\n\nBut the Igbo National Movement (INM) said the AGF\u2019s comment was not worth losing sleep over, just as it noted that Kanu\u2019s delayed trial would only strengthen the agitation for the Independent State of Biafra. National President of INM, Olisa Okolo said: \u201cThe AGF has put himself and the Federation in a tight corner. As we can see, they are unable to proceed with the trial due to the many delays which are inherent in the Nigerian legal system but with each delay, the calls for a political solution will grow stronger.\n\n\u201cWhat the AGF has succeeded in doing is to give Kanu a larger stage to keep the discussion going on his Biafran agitation and the general plight of Ndigbo. Each day the trial continues, the calls for self-determination grow stronger, and Ndigbo become ever more united. \u201cThe AGF is sadly out of his depth in political maneuvers and goes from one blunder to another. It is unlikely his advice will hold sway on a political solution. In due course, he must respect the will of the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Igbo National Congress (INC) has urged the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, grant amnesty to Kanu and make peace with the people of South-East. President of the group, Chilos Godsent, stated that the continued trial of Kanu, contrary to the views of the Attorney General, could only endanger the peace in the country.\n\nInsisting on political solution as the best option to solve the festering problem in the South-East, he demanded the unconditional release of Kanu, Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho and other political prisoners.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nPresident of Arewa Consultative Youth Movement and Convener Association of Northern Youth Groups, Mallam Kabiru Yusuf, has warned of the dangers of politicising the recent wellhead blowout and spillage incident involving the OML 29 Well 1 platform, Nembe, Bayelsa State, which is operated by Nigeria\u2019s largest indigenous oil firm, Aiteo Exploration and Production Company Limited (AEEPCO), a Joint Ventures project with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nAccording to Yusuf, when on November 5, AEEPCO reported a major oil leak from its well, which was spewing oil into the immediate water bodies and contiguous communities and fumes in the air, Aiteo activated technical containment measures and quickly invited highly competent foreign based technical experts with experience of managing emergencies of this nature to help arrest the situation. The firm, he said, \u201chas since mobilised to ground zero and has fully deployed measures to contain the leak including an effective fast-track spill recovery programme.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, has been high level, community targeted measures that has been providing provide relief and health related support to those immediately affected.\u201d Yusuf noted that for some incomprehensible reasons, several forces have equally deployed their armaments to smear and damage not only the image of Aiteo, but also its quite considerable efforts. \u201cFrom peddling specious information that the spill has led to losses in excess off two million barrels, some have alleged that over 500,000 barrels were spilled, while some have suggested stupendous loss of some 200,000 barrels daily.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the Director General/Chief Executive Officer, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who spoke last week on a national TV show, said, \u201cit is absolutely wrong and preposterous for people to make false speculations over the oil spillage in Nembe communities of Bayelsa State.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yusuf, this attack is \u201ca disgracefully organised conspiracy to put down Aiteo. Despite efforts by Aiteo to professionally contain the spill in Nembe, some see this incident as an opportunity to attack the company. Some interests are even, curiously, putting out old spill videos to create a negative false impression of the extent incident. \u201cIt certainly cannot be overstressed that what is playing out appears like well-choreographed intrigue at work to undermine Aiteo and besmirch ongoing efforts to contain the leak and mitigate the impact on communities around the location of the well.\u201d\n\nHe accused the Bayelsa State governor Douye Diri of demonstrating a disturbing disposition towards this issue.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

This time around, they used the instrument of religion to penetrate the DG. And the way and manner the DG has used religion as a tool is alarming. Contractors are classified along with religious lines and other despicable acts. What the DG has failed to realize is that these same people are the ones that go about telling the world about how he is corruptly enriching himself.\n\n\u201cWe all are aware of how the former DG was suspended and eventually sacked for corrupt practices. And in truth, if the current DG escapes this, then it would be a miracle because he has involved himself with acts that are very uncharitable in less than a year,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "Some workers of the National Broadcasting Corporation have accused the Director-General of the agency, Balarabe Shehu Ilelah, of nepotism and marginalisation.\nThey accused Ilelah of engaging in illegal award of contracts to friends, family members and cronies in violation of procurement laws.\nAccording to the workers, Ilelah has abused all known procurement regulations in the agency.\nHe stated that a clique at the commission set traps for the Director-General through the indiscriminate award of contracts.\nThey give wrong advice to the DG and show him how to shortchange the system through the award of contracts.",

          "title": "A yellow bus ride and musings on 2023",
          "text": "On Thursday, I did something I had not done in Lagos since 1999: I rode in a public bus. I had taken my car for service at Oba Akran Avenue, Ikeja. I was told it would be ready \u201cin two hours\u201d. I thought to wait at the reception to do some office work. But as the guy started amending \u201cin two hours\u201d to \u201cbetween two and three hours\u201d, I suspected that it might stretch to between \u201cfour and five hours\u201d. After all, I was not in front of the queue. I decided to return to my office. My first instinct was to hail a cab. My office was not far away and I should normally be there in 15 minutes. Then I remembered the kilometres of traffic jam I had seen on Awolowo Way. This was not a problem Uber could solve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen an idea struck me: take a yellow bus! My enthusiasm was babyish. The last time I rode in a yellow bus was in August 1999. That was the month I got my first car, an official property that effectively created a wedge between the good old yellow bus and myself. As I walked towards Ikeja bus stop, one conductor was shouting \u201cAh-eh-gey!\u201d I smiled. So, these people still pronounce \u201cAgege\u201d this way? The world has not changed a bit. I kept walking till I got to the bus stop where the conductor was yelling \u201cOjodu Berger!\u201d I approached him and asked, in whispers, if the bus would pass in front of \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d. He responded: \u201cN200!\u201d I didn\u2019t need an interpreter. Deal sealed.\n\nEverything was very familiar. It was an 18-seater bus with battered seats and severely scratched plastic windows. I got a seat on the third row. I was the third passenger on the row, so there was still a seat beside me. The row behind was not filled yet. No passenger wanted to sit on there. They would come, peep inside the bus and stay outside, waiting for the person who would volunteer to the back. I never used to like the back row myself \u2014 I am a six-footer and always had to squeeze my legs into the tiny space. I still have knee pains from my previous life riding in public transport for hours between Ilorin and Lagos. Eventually, the yellow bus filled up and the conductor took his seat.\n\nBarely 100 metres after take-off, before even reaching cruising level, the conductor started demanding payment. Things were so familiar. The policewoman in front of me did not pay. They call people like that \u201cstaff\u201d. I don\u2019t know when this culture started, but uniformed men and women were not paying transport fare in those days either. I won\u2019t be surprised if NSCDC members have joined the free riders\u2019 association too. In a sense, you could say the bus drivers are trying to recognise and reward the sacrifices of these officers to the nation. But, in truth, the conductors dare not insist on collecting the fare. It is not voluntary appreciation: this is pure impunity and daylight robbery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man on my right was smelling of ogogoro. This was around 11am. Legend! I had noticed that when he jumped into the bus, he was grimacing. I had thought he hit his leg or head against something. All my \u201csorry\u201d went unnoticed. It was when a wave of ogogoro-laced air started blowing in my direction that I understood the game. I had my face mask to thank for the protection I enjoyed from the alcoholic pollution. For the 30-minute ride between Ikeja and the closest bus stop to my office (the traffic was that bad), the man slept most of the time. He had given the conductor N1,000 and seemed to wake up each time he remembered he had not collected his N800 change.\n\nI was happy to volunteer as the \u201cassistant conductor\u201d. I would collect the fare and pass it on to my boss \u2014 the chief conductor \u2014 and then convey the change to fellow passengers. It was service to humanity. There was no commission. Full disclosure: I am a veteran fare collector. In the 1980s when I was a secondary school student back in my village, my holiday job was serving as conductor in my grandfather\u2019s transport business. He had a fleet of vehicles all bearing the inscription: \u201cNo Condition is Permanent\u201d. He often accused my grandmother of overpampering me and always looked pleased each time I volunteered to be a conductor. One more disclosure: I always got paid. It was pure fun.\n\nOnly four of us wore masks. After all, how many Nigerians believe COVID-19 is real? In my interactions with ordinary Nigerians, even those who believe COVID-19 is real would tell you it is \u201cordinary malaria\u201d that has been glorified. I once asked one of those pushing the idea: was it \u201cordinary malaria\u201d that killed Abba Kyari, Abiola Ajimobi and the rest? The response shut me up: \u201cIt kills only big men!\u201d My barber told me as much too. \u201cI have never worn a face mask and nothing has happened to me. It is a disease for the rich!\u201d he declared. My silent response: we should be thankful that COVID does not behave like Ebola. Otherwise, Nigeria would have become a gigantic graveyard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no AC. The heat was much and I was sweating a flood. One passenger suddenly opened a bottle of my favourite drink \u2014 chilled Coke Classic. Thirst overwhelmed me instantly and I coveted a sip. But my grandmother, God rest her soul, used to caution me against eating or drinking from strangers. \u201cThey will drug you and kidnap you,\u201d she would say. Kidnapping used to be only for ritual purposes. Today, it is also a commercial venture, bringing in billions of naira as criminals create businesses and jobs in the dark economy. In Lagos, though, there is this \u201cone chance\u201d phenomenon in which ritualists use buses to kidnap passengers. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t remember before the ride.\n\nThere were downsides to my ride. One, I kept checking for my phone and wallet. Do I have trust issues? I hear phones and wallets disappear from pockets inside the bus. I did not stop touching them until I got to my bus stop. My bus stop? That was another issue. It dawned on me I did not know the name of the one closest to my office. Testing Ground? Radio? Coca-Cola? Should I ask my boss? No way! We Lagosians would rather eat grass than show our vulnerabilities. We would be seen as JJCs. And that was how I watched in horror as we went past my bus stop. I quickly told the conductor I would drop at \u201cnext bus stop\u201d. I gallantly trekked back. Too much sense won\u2019t kill me!\n\nWhen I got to office and narrated my experience to my colleagues, I got an important piece of information: I took the wrong bus. I should have taken \u201cSecretariat\u201d, not \u201cOjodu Berger\u201d, and the fare would have been N100, not N200. It now made sense why the conductor yelled \u201cN200\u201d. He probably thought I wanted to use \u201cLagos sense\u201d to negotiate a cheaper fare for \u201cCoco-Cola\u201d and was not in the mood for that nonsense on a Thursday morning. When I went back for my car two and a half hours later (yes, they kept to time), I was wiser. I paid only N100. This time, I even enjoyed the privilege of sitting beside the driver, who instructed me with a smile: \u201cOga, wear your seat belt.\u201d\n\nMy yellow bus experience got me thinking on so many things. One, why can\u2019t public transport be decent, comfortable and safe in Nigeria? It will save us so many headaches. Who says I must drive a car to the office? Imagine the impact on the traffic and the environment when we all put our cars on the road. More so, an efficient and affordable public transportation system will relieve the burdens on the low-income earners in terms of transportation cost and quality of life. Even CEOs should be able to use public transport without feeling scared about security or getting worried about the conditions. After all, Wall Street executives use public transport. This is something we need to think about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, I was also thinking about the contrasting living conditions of Nigerians. Let us do some math. If I was living in Ikeja and working in Ojodu, I would spend at least N400 on transport daily. That is N8,000 monthly, minus lunch. If I pay a monthly rent of N10,000 and give my children transport fare to school \u2014 in addition to buying foodstuff for the house and paying utility bills, and the little matter of school fees and hospital bills \u2014 my monthly expenses would be far in excess of the N30,000 minimum wage, which most Nigerians don\u2019t even earn. Throw in the fact that over 20 million Nigerians don\u2019t have jobs and you would catch a glimpse of the real story of Nigerian poverty.\n\nThe inequality in Nigeria is too much. In the same country, some people \u2014 by virtue of their unfettered access to the treasury \u2014 ride the most expensive cars and jets, send their children to the most expensive schools home and abroad, and receive the best medical treatment money can buy. For sure, I know that there are poor people in advanced countries. Jesus Christ himself said we would always have the poor among us. But that is relative poverty. What we are dealing with in Nigeria is extreme poverty, with tens of millions of citizens surviving on less than N600 per day. People can be poor but they should also be able to enjoy some comfort here and there.\n\nThe ruling class must do some soul-searching and ask themselves honest questions as we approach another general election. It is not enough to coin sexy slogans and wear colourful attires. How many millions have they pulled out of poverty since 1999? How many Nigerians now have decent accommodation with water and electricity? How many can afford basic medications? These real-life issues should ordinarily shape the agenda for 2023. But, unfortunately, my yellow bus colleagues are more likely to be excited by ethnic, religious and partisan emotions. That is how issues are being framed by the political elite \u2014 who have already taken good care of themselves. Frustrating.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nOROMONI\u2019S AGONY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ghastly story of Sylvester Oromoni Junior, a 12-year-old student of Dowen College, Lagos, is something no parent should experience. He was reportedly bullied, bruised and battered by fellow students. The bullies were said to have forced him to say he got injured playing football and this was apparently the line the school towed, although the boy reportedly confessed when his parents took him home to Warri, Delta state, that he was bullied by five students. Painfully, he died afterwards. A lot of things went wrong on all sides. While nothing will bring Junior back to life, this tragedy offers an opportunity to seriously tackle bullying in our schools before another soul is lost. Condolences.\n\nEND GAME\n\nThe Lagos state government has rejected certain aspects of the End SARS panel report, pointing out what it calls \u201cinconsistencies\u201d. The government says names of nine people just \u201csprang up\u201d as killed at the Lekki Toll Plaza but the circumstances surrounding their death were neither explained nor investigated by the panel. (Ironically, three of those listed as killed are reportedly still alive \u2014 which is why some have alleged that the panel was working to an answer). While I do not doubt that there are loopholes in the report, the key issues still have to be comprehensively addressed: police brutality and civilised management of public protests. Justice must be also served. Non-negotiable.\n\nHEADLESS SPENDING\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation, made a revelation on Tuesday but it did not trend. He said about 60% of federal government\u2019s overhead expenditure (an aspect of recurrent spending) from 2012 to 2014 was spent on travels, maintenance, local and international training, welfare, office stationery/consumables, honoraria, etc. Recent data from the budget office, he said, showed that MDAs\u2019 recurrent spending is still on the rise: from N3.61trn in 2015 to N5.26trn in 2018 and N7.91trn in 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the summary of how our money is spent in Nigeria. I bet this is what also happens in the states \u2014 in the spirit of true federalism. Priorities.\n\nOMINOUS OMICRON\n\nThe world has gone into a frenzy since the discovery of another variant of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has promptly named \u201cOmicron\u201d (WHO is very good at naming viruses). Nobody is sure if Omicron will evade the current vaccines since it is new. As a result, many countries have been taking harsh measures in trying to keep it at bay. Many commentators have been angry at the \u201cknee jerk\u201d reactions, especially the ban on flights from southern African countries. I think countries are only trying to be cautious. If the world had banned all flights from China when Wuhan happened, the story might have been different today. Hindsight.",

Even CEOs should be able to use public transport without feeling scared about security or getting worried about the conditions. After all, Wall Street executives use public transport. This is something we need to think about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, I was also thinking about the contrasting living conditions of Nigerians. Let us do some math. If I was living in Ikeja and working in Ojodu, I would spend at least N400 on transport daily. That is N8,000 monthly, minus lunch. If I pay a monthly rent of N10,000 and give my children transport fare to school \u2014 in addition to buying foodstuff for the house and paying utility bills, and the little matter of school fees and hospital bills \u2014 my monthly expenses would be far in excess of the N30,000 minimum wage, which most Nigerians don\u2019t even earn. Throw in the fact that over 20 million Nigerians don\u2019t have jobs and you would catch a glimpse of the real story of Nigerian poverty.\n\nThe inequality in Nigeria is too much. In the same country, some people \u2014 by virtue of their unfettered access to the treasury \u2014 ride the most expensive cars and jets, send their children to the most expensive schools home and abroad, and receive the best medical treatment money can buy. For sure, I know that there are poor people in advanced countries. Jesus Christ himself said we would always have the poor among us. But that is relative poverty. What we are dealing with in Nigeria is extreme poverty, with tens of millions of citizens surviving on less than N600 per day. People can be poor but they should also be able to enjoy some comfort here and there.\n\nThe ruling class must do some soul-searching and ask themselves honest questions as we approach another general election. It is not enough to coin sexy slogans and wear colourful attires. How many millions have they pulled out of poverty since 1999? How many Nigerians now have decent accommodation with water and electricity? How many can afford basic medications? These real-life issues should ordinarily shape the agenda for 2023. But, unfortunately, my yellow bus colleagues are more likely to be excited by ethnic, religious and partisan emotions. That is how issues are being framed by the political elite \u2014 who have already taken good care of themselves. Frustrating.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nOROMONI\u2019S AGONY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ghastly story of Sylvester Oromoni Junior, a 12-year-old student of Dowen College, Lagos, is something no parent should experience. He was reportedly bullied, bruised and battered by fellow students. The bullies were said to have forced him to say he got injured playing football and this was apparently the line the school towed, although the boy reportedly confessed when his parents took him home to Warri, Delta state, that he was bullied by five students. Painfully, he died afterwards. A lot of things went wrong on all sides. While nothing will bring Junior back to life, this tragedy offers an opportunity to seriously tackle bullying in our schools before another soul is lost. Condolences.\n\nEND GAME\n\nThe Lagos state government has rejected certain aspects of the End SARS panel report, pointing out what it calls \u201cinconsistencies\u201d. The government says names of nine people just \u201csprang up\u201d as killed at the Lekki Toll Plaza but the circumstances surrounding their death were neither explained nor investigated by the panel. (Ironically, three of those listed as killed are reportedly still alive \u2014 which is why some have alleged that the panel was working to an answer). While I do not doubt that there are loopholes in the report, the key issues still have to be comprehensively addressed: police brutality and civilised management of public protests. Justice must be also served. Non-negotiable.\n\nHEADLESS SPENDING\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation, made a revelation on Tuesday but it did not trend. He said about 60% of federal government\u2019s overhead expenditure (an aspect of recurrent spending) from 2012 to 2014 was spent on travels, maintenance, local and international training, welfare, office stationery/consumables, honoraria, etc. Recent data from the budget office, he said, showed that MDAs\u2019 recurrent spending is still on the rise: from N3.61trn in 2015 to N5.26trn in 2018 and N7.91trn in 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the summary of how our money is spent in Nigeria. I bet this is what also happens in the states \u2014 in the spirit of true federalism. Priorities.\n\nOMINOUS OMICRON\n\nThe world has gone into a frenzy since the discovery of another variant of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has promptly named \u201cOmicron\u201d (WHO is very good at naming viruses). Nobody is sure if Omicron will evade the current vaccines since it is new. As a result, many countries have been taking harsh measures in trying to keep it at bay. Many commentators have been angry at the \u201cknee jerk\u201d reactions, especially the ban on flights from southern African countries. I think countries are only trying to be cautious. If the world had banned all flights from China when Wuhan happened, the story might have been different today. Hindsight.",

          "text": "The United Kingdom says Nigeria will be added to the countries on its red list as a result of the discovery of COVID Omicron cases linked to Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSajid Javid, the UK health secretary, disclosed this on Saturday in a television interview.\n\nThe South Africa National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) had, on November 25, announced the discovery of 22 positive cases of the new Omicron variant.\n\nFollowing the discovery, a number of countries banned travel from countries in southern Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UK had also placed a temporary ban on air travel from six southern African countries \u2014 South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe \u2014 with immediate effect to prevent importation of the variant into Britain.\n\nAccording to the new protocol announced on Saturday, non-UK and non-Irish citizens who are travelling in from Nigeria will not be allowed entry into the UK.\n\n\u201cOver the recent days, we have learned of a significant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria. There are 27 cases already in England and that\u2019s growing. Nigeria narrows second only to South Africa in terms of cases linked to Omicron,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo today, the government has decided to add Nigeria to the travel red list and that will be effective from 4am on Monday.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology?

Oui Capital and other angel investors also participated in the round.\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work: Interestingly, Herconomy closed the funding round in just 24 hours. A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics.\n\nAn awareness campaign that the stigma attached to people living with AIDS can be just as deadly as the disease.\n\nIn a press statement by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the world \u201ccould face 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next ten years\u201d if inequalities are not addressed.\n\nToday\u2019s insight on AIDS is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here.\n\nOctamile raises $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctamile Founder, Gbenro Dara\n\nOctamile, an African insurtech startup, has closed a $500,000 pre-seed round to simplify access to insurance for Africans.\n\nThe funding round was led by EchoVC. Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most stories, there are almost always two sides of the coin. When it comes to fundraising, for some, it could be as easy as getting funds in two hours, and for others, it could take as much as nine years\n\nThe fundraising journey can be very tedious, and as Bashir Aminu, Payourse CEO, told Techpoint Africa on a call yesterday, it took a while for everything to come together.\n\nToday, Payourse announces a $600,000 pre-seed, which saw participation from Michael Ugwu, Flori Ventures, Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Others include CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg; Kola Aina, Managing Partner, Ventures Platform; Angel Touch Holdings; and Oluwatobi Anisere.\n\nThis is the company\u2019s first real funding round, with the combination of a $100,000 raise from Ugwu in March 2021, another $100,000 from Flori Ventures in July 2021 and an angel investment from Payourse\u2019s co-founder, John Anisere\u2019s brother, Oluwatobi Anisere in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Aminu tells Techpoint Africa that they never actually reached out to investors. Ugwu sent a Direct Message to one of the co-founders on Twitter, Flori Ventures was introduced through a partner and so was Olumide Soyombo, Founder of Volton Capital.\n\nBut the early days of applying to accelerators and getting rejected \u2014 they applied to Y Combinator twice and got rejected both times \u2014 taught them an important lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was getting the meeting with the investors that was the problem. We realised that once we actually get a meeting with an investor and talk to them, they want to invest. The first day we had a call with Michael, he wanted to invest.\u201d The same story with Flori Ventures, Aminu says.\n\nThe journey into entrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Aminu, Anisere, and Hakeem Orewole co-founded Payourse, launching the company\u2019s first product, Coinprofile.\n\nAminu had dropped out of a five-year programme in the Federal University of Technology, Minna in 2017, but had caught the crypto bug before then.\n\n\u201cI found out about crypto from a friend and then I bought some and since then I became obsessed. Because it was interesting to me and I was someone who was really curious back in school, and II didn\u2019t really understand how it could be money and wanted to understand it. I kind of went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand how bitcoin and crypto works.\u201d\n\nThat same year, he met Orewole on an online crypto forum and the two became good friends. So good that both founded a crypto startup in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, it failed because, as Aminu laughingly says, \u201cI was very young then and didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d They went on to found another startup in 2018, but this one \u201cfailed even faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, Aminu decided the startup life was not for him and decided to take his chances in the labour market.\n\nDuring his undergraduate days, he had learnt graphic design and soon got a job with an Australian company where he learnt a little bit of product designing while in his role as a graphic designer.\n\nHe moved to Busha \u2014 where he met Anisere \u2014 and then to TeamApt, Yellow Card, Interswitch, and finally Binance.\n\nWhat is a Payourse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayourse\u2019s homepage\n\nOn Monday, November 22, 2021, Aminu announced on Twitter a new parent company, Payourse.\n\nToday, I'm excited to introduce our new parent brand.\n\n\n\nMeet Payourse @payourse. We're passionate about accelerating access to crypto for Africans by providing tools that make it easier, faster and cheaper for businesses to build user-friendly crypto products like @coinpHQ. \u2014 Bash \u6211\u521b\u9020 \u272a (@scozky) November 22, 2021\n\nBut as he tells Techpoint during our call, Payourse has been in existence since 2019, when they first founded Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cWell, we actually created Payourse, a long time ago, in 2019 as a parent company, but we never really announced it to the world. But it\u2019s always been the parent company. And we\u2019ve always had this long term vision of a company which would build user-friendly products on top of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to make crypto accessible to everyone, as Aminu strongly believes it is the future of finance in Africa.\n\nAfrica is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally with six countries \u2014 Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania \u2014 making it into the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20.\n\nThe Web3 \u2014 a decentralised version of the Internet built on public blockchains \u2014 craze has also been making waves, with increasing noise being made in crypto and blockchain spaces.\n\nHowever, apart from creating accessible products is the vision to be the crypto powerhouse, a go-to for any organisation looking to build or integrate Web3 or crypto products.\n\nPayourse currently has two major products, Coinprofile and Simpa.\n\nThe first iteration of Coinprofile was a Disha but for crypto wallets.\n\n\u201cI used to be an OTC (over-the-counter) trader, so anytime someone wants to send me crypto, and I always have to go to my wallet address and copy wallet address and send it to them. It was a very tedious process.\u201d\n\nFrom experience, he knew that other traders faced the same issues, so the idea was for people to create an account and store all their wallet addresses, and a unique link is created, leading to a landing page. This was where the name coinprofile came from. It doesn\u2019t require sign-ups, and there are no transaction charges.\n\nThe current remittance product came in May. Now, users can send cryptocurrency to anyone and receive it in cash in their bank accounts.\n\nThen there\u2019s Simpa, a no-code tool that enables businesses to create their own crypto exchange.\n\nThe numbers and the challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith free transfers, how does Payourse make money? Well, Aminu tells Techpoint that they earn an average of 1.5 \u2013 2% and sometimes even as much as 10% per transaction.\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile, with millions of dollars processed on the platform. Since its launch, the exchange has grown 15,000% across all touchpoints and maintained a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nAminu says Simpa is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version and is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks.\n\nBut building a company always comes with its challenges. And two of the biggest have been talent and marketing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced challenges in hiring. In fact, we\u2019ve had to let go of two of our employees. We had to hire them at that point because we hadn\u2019t raised a lot of funding, and we couldn\u2019t get a lot of really good people to apply for our roles.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they\u2019ve had to settle for junior to mid-level developers, with most senior developers opting to work for international companies.\n\nWith a team of eight and three technical founders, they\u2019ve had to rely on word of mouth and judging by their numbers, they might not be doing too badly, but Aminu tells us that an essential hire in the wake of this raise is hiring a Growth or Marketing person.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from hiring, Aminu outlines two critical things this fund would be used for: building out current products to package them for sales and making existing use cases better.\n\nIn a round that was oversubscribed up to $2 million, Aminu says there\u2019s no rush to get more funding.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe Payourse will be the powerhouse of crypto in Africa. When a business wants to develop crypto products for the African market or wants to integrate crypto into what they already have, we are the go-to.\n\n\u201cOur plan is not just to build infrastructure, but also build use cases around the infrastructure. We already have Coinprofile and Simpa. It might take a while, but we are not honestly looking to raise a $100 million very quickly. We want to, first of all, have a business and a clear path to revenue. The funding will come.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Some oil majors are excluding Nigeria from their capital expenditure budgets for 2022, others are divesting out of onshore assets and local producers struggling to restart fields shut in last year during lockdowns, lack capacity to ramp up production, developments that question the country\u2019s ability to meet its production targets next year.\n\nOil cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and its allies led by Russia agreed on Thursday to stick with its current plan to adjust crude output by an additional 400,000 barrels a day in January and raised Nigeria\u2019s output from about 1.5 million barrels per day to 1.683mbpd beginning from January 2022.\n\nNormally, rising oil prices and higher volumes should boost the economy and strengthen the local currency but Nigeria\u2019s reality is nuanced. Production has fallen by over 700,000 bpd this year, as IOCs prioritize investments in other climes.\n\nFor instance, five Western majors such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and Total Energies are set to raise their capital spending by at least $12 billion next year, as higher oil and natural gas prices allow investment to return to more sustainable levels.\n\nThese companies are comfortably ignoring Nigeria and moving forward with higher spending in upstream oil and gas in Libya\u2019s Mabruk field, Payara and Yellowtail developments offshore Guyana, the recently sanctioned Equinor-operated Bacalhau scheme offshore Brazil, the US Permian Basin and multiple refining and chemical expansions in the US, UK and Singapore.\n\nRead Also: Oil firms ignore Nigeria, pump fresh dollars into Libya\n\nData gleaned from Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest report showed over the last decade the IOCs\u2019 average capital expenditure per barrel of oil equivalent has fallen seven times more in Nigeria compared to that of the rest of their portfolio.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s data also showed in 2020 the average CAPEX per barrel of oil equivalent across the global portfolios was 51 percent of 2010 levels, whereas the equivalent metric for the Nigeria assets was 7.4percent.\n\n\u201cThe significant drop in investment by these IOCs in Nigeria goes beyond capital discipline alone,\u201d Simon Anderson, director performance improvement sub- Saharan Africa at Wood Mackenzie said in a note. \u201cSome Nigeria assets may be under-invested, resulting in potential upside opportunities\u201d.\n\nDivestments by oil majors amid limited local capacity present another challenge.\n\n\u201cDespite the profitability of their Nigeria assets, the IOCs are under increased pressure to accelerate their energy transition and divest non-core assets,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie said.\n\nSome analysts say the recent quest by oil majors may have exposed the financial and technical capabilities of Nigeria\u2019s domestic operators, who pump between 1,000 and 100,000 barrels each day.\n\n\u201cMany indigenous operators are sitting on significant resources, with opportunities to grow production with access to capital investment,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie added.\n\nFor Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of State for Petroleum Resources, the country\u2019s oil production struggles can only be attributed to technical problems from re-tapping reservoirs that had been shuttered to comply with the stringent OPEC+ cuts of the past 17 months.\n\nKey Nigerian grade Forcados had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted force majeure on loadings on September 10. Industry sources said the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil production is currently struggling at levels never seen before, but the regulators are ignoring the problem and disguising under OPEC\u2019s quota,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, says.\n\nAlso, a new wave of security threats in Nigeria has emerged that could further dent Nigeria\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cLately there have been groups in communities in the Niger Delta, who while seeking for cash and attention, have been vandalizing oil pipelines,\u201d a Nigeria-based official at a Western oil company said. \u201cDisruption to operations of oil companies in the Niger Delta is rising by the day due to the activities of these vandals.\u201d\n\nA week ago, a militant group in the Niger Delta region code-named Bayan-Men blew up an oil facility producing around 5,000 bpd of condensates operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company, (NAOC) in Ogba-Egbema-Andoni local government area, Rivers State.\n\nThe angry militants, who destroyed oil well, OB5, (Obiavu-5) in the area, accused the oil firm of failing to deal directly with the host communities insisting that they were fighting for justice for their people.",

As we continue to watch this case closely, we extend our prayers and support to the Oromoni family.\n\n\u201cAs they mourn the loss of their young son, I pray that Almighty God gives them the strength that they need at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the umbrella body of Ijaw Youths worldwide, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) has joined in demanding for justice for the Ikaw born student.\n\nIn a statement signed by Comr. Ebilade Ekerefe National Spokesman, Ijaw Youth Council and made available to newsmen in Warri, the group said,\n\n\u201cWe watched with awe and shock the reported circumstances surrounding the death of a 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe have read to our chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe supposed injuries from the beatings led to his death, according to a Twitter user with the handle\n\n@perrisonoromoni, the boy\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the school\u2019s statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u201cLate Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbeh-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil. We are thankful to them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the\n\nschool management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by\n\ntrying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the Ijaw Youths worldwide wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester\n\nOromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe also call for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death. They have shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder. The fake story about the hip injury from a game of football shows in clear language that they are complicit in the crime!\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating license of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity showed by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commiserate with Sylvester Oromini Snr and the entire Ogbeh-Ijoh Royal family on this royal blood that has been spilled in a most dastardly manner.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) has decried the inability of Nigeria\u2019s pro democracy activists to stand up to be counted in the face what it described as the country\u2019s fast descent into dictatorship under President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe ADF in a statement signed by its president, Professor Uzodinma Nwala and its spokesperson, Chief Abia Onyike, titled: \u201cWhere are Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Activists? Why are they Missing in Action?\u201d issued at the weekend in Enugu, conceded that there is no doubt that the pro-democracy movement in Nigeria played a major role in the termination of military rule in 1999, through their engagement in various popular platforms and also through the active participation of their notable leaders in the realignment of forces leading up to the formation of political parties, but wondered why the same activists have decided to dine with the same forces they fought in the 80s and 90s.\n\nAccording to the foundation, \u201cThe 1990s witnessed the re-awakening of popular democratic forces in Nigeria. The Nigerian left enjoyed a broad coalition of forces which brought together many veterans of the anti-colonial movement, Marxists, Socialists, human rights activists, labour leaders and their organizations, Youth Organizations, Market Women and other Mass Organizations. It was from this historic alliances that several pro-democracy organizations were formed, namely: National Democratic Coalition ( NADECO), Campaign for Democracy (CD), Democratic Alternative (DA), Uhuru Research Council (URC), Revolutionary Directorate (RD), etc.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected the pro-democracy movement to have formed its own party or taken control of any of the registered political parties in the 1998/1999 period. But unfortunately, all the openings for democratic engagement which were offered for the deepening of democratic governance in Nigeria were frittered away.\u201d\n\nADF said it was regrettable that in the build up to the 2015 presidential election, the most vocal and proactive segment of the country\u2019s pro democracy movement went into an alliance with the fascist wing of the ruling class, in what it said, appeared to be a plan to decimate democratic movement in the country.\n\nAccording to ADF, \u201cThen the most dangerous step was taken in the build-up to the 2015 general elections when the most active segments of the pro-democracy movement went into an alliance with the most reactionary/fascist wing of the Nigerian ruling class, led by a retired Military dictator, General Muhammadu Buhari. It would appear that there was a very clear conspiracy to permanently mortgage the democratic movement in Nigeria as represented by the pro-democracy and labour activists by luring them and having them surrender and align with the anti democratic forces. They ignored the lessons of history and forgot that Buhari was the right hand man of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Military Head of State who seized power from the Ernest Shonekan Interim National Government.\n\n\u201cToday, the result of the misadventure by the pro-democracy Chieftains is obvious. Consequently, the party which houses most of the pro-democracy leaders is the one that has ruined the Republic, with the result that the country is facing the worst form of insecurity in its history. NIGERIA\u2019S economy lies prostrate, as the international economic regimes, namely IMF and World Bank dictate anti-peoples policies targeting complete removal of oil subsidies while the national currency, the Naira has been devastatingly devalued. Nigerians have been short-changed more terribly. Poverty and hunger walk majestically on the streets of Nigeria. Where are the pro-democracy activists? Why are they missing in action?\n\n\u201cTragically, as these ugly events unfolded, the pro-democracy activists felt ignorant and unperturbed as their beloved regime opened NIGERIA\u2019S borders to irredentist foreign Fulani militants and Jihadists.\n\n\u201d It is not enough for the pro-democracy leaders to claim that they joined the APC because one of their their leaders and NADECO veteran, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu was one of the architects and promoters of the new alliance which produced the Buhari civilian regime. All these developments point to one fact: which is that many of those who claimed to be pro-democracy activists were lured to join the reactionary alliance because of immediate material gains. Which means that Comrades are not immune from the politics of Ritu Ritu and Ratu Ratu (i.e., Politics of the Stomach).\n\n\u201cFor those who joined the political bandwagon, one thing was very clear. They suffered from the poverty of correct political analysis. The question is: What was their disaffection? The Nigerian left should not allow itself to be drawn into the political culture of the herd instinct. The mere fact that some of the King-pins of the pro-democracy movement were the arrowheads of the alliance with Buhari (an alliance led by an Abacha protegee) was not a sufficient and logical reason to go into the alliance with a well-known autocratic maximum dictator.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if the pro-democracy movement had rallied round former President, Goodluck Jonathan, they would have helped to return Nigeria to a more steady democratic course than the current anarchic situation which is set to consume everybody.\n\n\u201cWhat lesson does this reality pose for the immediate future of Nigeria\u2019s democratic evolution? It teaches that it is better for the democratic forces to stand behind an honest political actor, even if he is a neophite but not one that has the history of alliance or mentorship by sordid reactionary forces whose identities we do not need a Seer to teach us. As democrats, we need to identify leaders who are ready to learn and rally round them to save Nigeria from the impending, indeed raging Holocaust.\n\n\u201cWhether the resolution of the Nigerian political quagmire is a matter of TO BE or NOT TO BE, it requires honest democratic commitment to resolve, without turning the Nigerian society into a grave yard.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

How do I mean? We have done some of these in before. Solar-powered engineers, soap makers, Kampala makers and even agriculture sector. In fact there is one we did for hairdressers. After the training we gave them equipment and cash for shop rents. In agriculture sector, we gave the beneficiaries five cows each for startups,\u201d she partly said.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Mrs. Ajiboye Yetunde appreciated the Senator for the opportunity avail to them.\n\n\u201cWe thank our Senator for the opportunity to provide to us to be beneficiaries of these programmes. May God continues to be with him. We believe he did these so as to ameliorate poverty in the country. We can see that from 29th of November that we have been here, we have been taught so many things in businesses. We learned how to create and sustain small businesses into large businesses via strategic planning.\n\n\u201cWe also learn how to identify human wants in our community, package them for business purposes and turn it into a lucrative business. I pray that God continues to strengthen him. He wouldn\u2019t let Osun State be in disarray. Tell the Senator we appreciate him,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the same vein, Mr. Tajudeen Sulaiman Adigun who was one of the beneficiaries said, \u201cWe appreciate God, and after Him our distinguished Senator. We appreciate our Senator because if after all the training he didn\u2019t add the startup monies, what do we need to do?\n\n\u201cHis gesture of these programmes are indications of ingratitude he feels for confidence we had in his candidacy and voted him as our representative.\n\n\u201cI understand that for some, this is a startup, while for some this is an Integral part.

          "text": "The umbrella body of Ijaw youths worldwide, the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), has expressed dismay over the reported circumstances surrounding the death of a 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday by its National Spokesman, Ebilade Ekerefe, the group said they had read to their chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\nEkerefe demanded justice for the deceased student, saying that the supposed injuries from\n\nthe beatings led to his death, according to a Twitter.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the schools statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u2013\n\n\u201cLate Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbeh-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to them.\n\nThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the school management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by trying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the IYC wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\u201d\n\nEkerefe also called for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death.\n\nHe said they had shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder, insisting that the story about the hip injury from a game of football showed in clear language that they were complicit in the crime.\n\nEkerefe added: \u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating licence of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity shown by Nigerians. Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to them.\n\nThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the school management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by trying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the IYC wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\u201d\n\nEkerefe also called for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death.\n\nHe said they had shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder, insisting that the story about the hip injury from a game of football showed in clear language that they were complicit in the crime.\n\nEkerefe added: \u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating licence of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity shown by Nigerians. Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Itunu Babalola, the Nigerian lady who died in prison in C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire after she was wrongly jailed, has been buried in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nThe remains of Babalola were interred on Saturday at the Sango Cemetery at 11:25am.\n\nShe was buried in the presence of officials of the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission sent by the Chairperson, Abike Dabiri-Erewa.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s body had arrived at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos on Friday at 11pm via Air C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire and had been conveyed to Oyo State.\n\nBabalola reportedly died on November 14 and Nigerians had taken to social media to express deep anger over the death of Babalola.\n\nAccording to reports, 21-year-old Babalola from Oyo State was a trader based in Bondoukou, Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Her apartment had been burgled by an Ivorian in September 2019 and she had reported the incident to the police but DPO informed her that the suspect was his nephew. He reportedly offered her a settlement worth roughly N100,000 to drop the case, an amount lesser than the N300,000 worth of stolen effects.\n\nBabalola was subsequently arrested when she refused the settlement, charged to court for human trafficking and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nA journalist, David Hundeyin, had shared the story of Babalola on Twitter in March 2021 and the NIDCOM had said it was working to prove the innocence of Babalola.\n\nAbike Dabiri-Erewa had confirmed that the lady was charged and incarcerated for a crime she didn\u2019t commit.\n\nHowever, many Nigerians were shocked on November 14 when Hundeyin, who had been following the case, gave serial updates that Babalola\u2019s contracted an infection in the Ivorian prison.\n\nSome were gutted that eight months after NIDCOM promised to ensure justice was served on the matter and secure the lady\u2019s freedom, Babalola still remained behind bars in the Francophone West African nation.\n\nIn defence, Dabiri-Erewa, blamed Babalola, saying she reported her plight late to the Nigerian Commission in Ivory Coast after she had spent two years in jail.\n\n\u201cShe did not inform the mission about the trial.

          "text": "\u2018\u2026Court ruling shows FG\u2019s resolve to crush banditry\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2026It indicates govt remains with global standards\u2019\n\n\u2026Mere declaration meaningless unless\u2026 \u2013 Gumi\n\n\u2018\u2026Re-naming bandits terrorists a political stunt\u2019\n\n\u2026It\u2019s better late than never \u2013 Northern youth\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja under trial Justice Taiwo Taiwo has ruled that the activities of bandits, as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country amounted to acts of terrorism and subsequently declared them terrorists. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the implications of the declaration on the war against banditry.\n\nThe order declaring bandits terrorists was sequel to an application filed on behalf of the federal government by the Director of Public Prosecution, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, regarding the activities of Yan Bindiga, Yan Ta\u2019adda and other groups of bandits in the country.\n\nIn the ex parte application, the federal government had prayed the court to outlaw the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other terrorist groups across the country.\n\nThe request, according to the federal government in a supporting affidavit, was to checkmate the activities of the groups, which the government said were responsible for killings, abductions, rapes, kidnappings, and other criminal acts in the North-east, North-central, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government blamed the groups for \u201cbanditry, incessant kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, and other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters, and wanton destruction of lives and proper property.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say that the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, were responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police officers, and other security agents across the country.\n\n\u201cCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities,\u201d the federal government noted.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, constitute acts of terrorism that can lead to a breakdown of public order and safety, as well as a threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security and corporate existence,\u201d the government in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe DPP said President Muhammadu Buhari gave the approval for his action, which objective is the proscription of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups and other terrorist groups.\n\nThe verdict\n\nSpecifically, the court declared the activities of the \u201cYan Bindiga Group\u201d and the \u201cYan Ta\u2019adda Group,\u201d as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones, to be \u201cacts of terrorism and illegality.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that \u201csimilar groups, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called, in any part of Nigeria, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones\u201d are terrorists and banned.\u201d\n\nJustice Taiwo said in the light of the nefarious activities of bandits and their effects on the people and the nation\u2019s economy, he was convinced that such orders were required.\n\nHe extended the proscription order to all other groups in the country, regardless of their names, whose activities and goals are similar to those of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups.\n\nAccording to the ruling, terror activities \u201cinclude, but not limited to banditry, kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters and wanton destruction of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe judge held further that the federal government must publish the prosecution order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nFG\u2019s reaction\n\nSimilarly, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, has said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations by a Federal High Court shows that the Nigerian government was determined to crush banditry in the country.\n\nReacting to the development through his spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, Malami, he said the court ruling proved that the federal government was taking the necessary steps to end banditry.\n\nThe minister, who said the development followed an application filed by his office, said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations \u201cshows that the federal government was acting in accordance with the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatists\u2019 organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\n\u201cBy this declaration, the Federal Government of Nigeria has taken bold steps to deal ruthlessly with all terrorist groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring a lasting solution to the myriad of insecurity challenges in the country,\u201d the AGF said.\n\nNorthern youth\u2019s take\n\nAlso, the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria in its reaction to the declaration in a statement jointly signed by its president, Comrade Isah Abubakar, and the director-general, media and publicity, Samuel Kure, noted that though it almost took the federal government \u2018forever\u2019 to act on the calls made by various interest groups in the country, including the Northern Youth Council, to declare bandits as terrorists, it was better late than never.\n\n\u201cWe will welcome full military operation in the North-west and North-central parts of the country as in the North-east against Boko Haram and ISWAP elements which have drastically reduced their activities. The Council hereby urges our Armed Forces and other sister security agencies, to arrest and prosecute anybody seen giving the terrorists moral support be it materially, morally or otherwise no matter how highly or lowly placed. The Northern Youths will stand with you in your quest to stamp out terrorism in the North and Nigeria at large,\u201d the youth said in the statement.\n\nCriticisms\n\nHowever, an Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, has dismissed the declaration of bandits as terrorists as mere political expediency, saying \u201cit will come to no effect.\u201d\n\nGumi said the declaration will have no effect as a similar pronouncement by the federal government on the South-east secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe Islamic cleric noted that although the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organisation was also backed by a court order, the international community did not accord it recognition.\n\nGumi in a statement by his media aide, Tukur Mamu, said declaring the herdsmen bandits as terrorists is a decision taken for political expediency.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has succumbed to media blackmail by a section of the country. The decision by the government will not have any practical value because even before the declaration, they are being fought and treated as terrorists. So, it is just a nomenclature which I believe will not change the dynamics on the ground.\n\n\u201cIf you can remember, IPOB was also declared a terrorist organisation. The declaration was even backed by the order of the court. But as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration of IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo, it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results. They have not been banned from travelling to other countries while their citizenship remains intact, it has not been denounced. So, what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nHe argued that very few herdsmen were bandits.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the license to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them. It will cause more mayhem.\n\n\u201cThe declaration will not change anything; it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them. It didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them. We told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue, and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because the government has accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them. There has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for everyone.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it, before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us; the Fulani have suffered so much. They have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration. They should have (a) sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nAlso, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a security analyst, Odafe Christopher, said the declaration could make the bandits declare allegiance to local and international terrorist groups, thereby scaling the nature of their attacks.\n\nHe said, \u201cTerrorist is a generic term for those, who react with high velocity violence during criminal action. The court is in order. They are not agitating for anything, rather than to kill, destroy and rob people. Bandits come in 50\u2019s and their attack is always devastating.\n\n\u201cThey leave traces of blood, tears and sorrow. They kill, rape, maim and can totally exterminate entire community. They are presently contributing to food scarcity, as farmers are taxed before they can either plant or harvest their farm produce. This is causing serious food scarcity.\n\n\u201cThe approach is likely to be the same and format in use with attacks on Boko Haram. My fear is the pronouncements could make them upgrade and declare allegiance with existing Islamic notorious groups like Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP).\u201d\n\nBeyond the declaration\n\nLikewise, speaking with this reporter, a lawyer and lecturer at Baze University Abuja, Mustapha Iliya, said it is unrealistic to expect that banditry will be ended simply because bandits have been re-labelled.\n\nIliya said, \u201cThe public debate about the aptness of re-naming bandits, and calling them terrorists, has ended in favour of those who favoured a re-naming. But the re-classification does not mean that banditry is about to become a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cIt is a new beginning for the old bandits as they struggle to understand their new category. It may well be that re-classifying bandits was based on a misperception. Banditry is not terrorism just because it looks like terrorism.\n\n\u201cUnder pressure from sections of the public, including federal lawmakers, the federal government needed to demonstrate greater seriousness in the fight against banditry. What is the difference between bandits and Boko Haram terrorists, for instance? Bandits are focused on sustenance, but terrorists seek political, religious or ideological results. The two are not the same thing, although they are similar because they terrorise the people.\n\n\u201cWill bandits become terrorists because they have been categorised as terrorists? Will they add political, religious or ideological objectives to their sustenance goals? It is noteworthy that the federal government is still fighting a war against terrorism that has gone on for more than a decade. This looks like the beginning of another war against terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cObviously, the country has not won the anti-terrorism war. The war continues because terrorist groups in the country are still active. Indeed, the insurgency has been compounded by the involvement of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP). The insurgents are no longer only Boko Haram members.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the re-classification is that the war against terrorism will now include bandits. It will amount to the government fighting on two fronts. Fighting terrorists and fighting bandits who have been declared terrorists at the same time will further complicate the war against terrorism.\n\n\u201cRe-naming bandits as terrorists is a political stunt. It is yet another move by the federal government to make the public believe that it is serious about tackling the country\u2019s security crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to change labels, and tag bandits as terrorists. But that does not change banditry, and it does not change terrorism. Perhaps, the government can afford to play word games, which is what this re-classification suggests, but the victims of bandits and terrorists know and feel the hell of insecurity. They need more than word games.\u201d\n\nMilitary action\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that following the declaration, the military is set to deploy Super Tucano aircraft and other sophisticated equipment in the North-west and North-central regions of the country against the bandits.\n\nThe military had been reluctant to deploy the aircraft outside the North-east because of the conditions attached to the sale of the aircraft by the United States, which was anchored on human rights.\n\nA source in the military also told a sister newspaper that the coast had become clear to deploy the Super Tucano aircraft against bandits in the North-west and North-central, following the court order declaring them as terrorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are waiting for instructions from the government for the next line of action. This was one of the things the Service Chiefs discussed with the President on Thursday morning. So, we await further instructions.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a security expert, Christopher Oji, told this reporter that the court pronouncement will give the military impetus to deploy all their arsenal against the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe pronouncement gives definite combat approvals to security forces and a clear direction for international intelligence and security community in support against them. The pronunciation will make both positive and negative impacts.\n\n\u201cRemember the military had told the National Assembly it could not deploy the newly acquired Super Tucano jets and other military hardware to the North-west against bandits due to the agreement signed with the United States Government regarding human rights.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you the truth. I once asked a top officer in the Armed Forces why they had not deployed the Tucano in the fight against the bandits and he said that their hands are tied due to the human rights regulations regarding the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the equipment is meant for the war against terrorists and insurgents and since these are bandits, they cannot be deployed.\n\n\u201cHe actually told me that once the bandits have been designated as terrorists, they would be wiped out. Don\u2019t forget that the bandits today are not different from Boko Haram, looking at their activities and the gravity of attacks by them.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities,\u201d the federal government noted.\nGumi in a statement by his media aide, Tukur Mamu, said declaring the herdsmen bandits as terrorists is a decision taken for political expediency.\n\u201cWill bandits become terrorists because they have been categorised as terrorists?\nFighting terrorists and fighting bandits who have been declared terrorists at the same time will further complicate the war against terrorism.\n\u201cIt is easy to change labels, and tag bandits as terrorists.",

Although, no life was lost, sadly a minor sustained injury,\u201d the army said.\n\n\u201cGround troops in conjunction with the Air Component of OPHK responded swiftly and dominated the area with ground and air interdictions that successfully neutralized the threats and infiltration attempt by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe general public are urged not to panic as troops are on ground and aggressively dominating the city to effectively take out any perceived threat.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Maiduguri are equally enjoined to go about their normal socio economic activities and provide actionable information on the movement of these criminal elements.\u201d\n\nTerrorist attacks\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack comes a day after seven soldiers were reportedly killed by ISWAP jihadists near a base at Rann, close to the Cameroonian border.\n\nIn February, at least 17 people were killed and 43 others injured when ISWAP fighters fired multiple rockets on Maiduguri.\n\nThe terrorists have also blown up electricity towers on several occasions, plunging the city into darkness for months.\n\nOn February 23, 2019, a soldier was killed and 20 others wounded when Boko Haram launched 13 rocket attacks on Maiduguri hours before voting began in Nigeria\u2019s presidential election.\n\nOver 40,000 people have been killed since the Boko Haram insurgency began 12 years ago and more than two million are displaced from their homes.\n\nZulum reacts\n\nBorno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, visited the scene of the explosions on Saturday and sympathised with those affected.\n\n\u201cIt seems the insurgents came very close to the town, the military has to wake up and ensure adequate surveillance,\u201d Zulum said.\n\nThis is something that we can avert its occurrence.

But while Trump has spent most of his life dodging legal consequences, he is no longer shielded by the protections against indictment enjoyed by sitting presidents. And any charges \u2014 which would be the first against a former president in the nation\u2019s history \u2014 could affect both his businesses and his future political prospects as he mulls running for a second term.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest on where the cases stand:\n\nNEW YORK\n\nNew York prosecutors are investigating the former president\u2019s business dealings and recently convened a new grand jury to hear evidence after the previous panel\u2019s term ran out.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is weighing whether to seek more indictments in the case, which resulted in tax fraud charges in July against Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. They are accused of cheating tax authorities through lucrative, untaxed fringe benefits.\n\nWeisselberg is due back in court in July 2022.\n\nTrump himself remains under investigation after District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who is leaving office at the end of the year, spent years fighting to access the former president\u2019s tax records. Prosecutors have also been considering whether to seek charges against the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Matthew Calamari Sr.\n\nInvestigators working for Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James have spent more than two years looking at whether the Trump Organization misled banks or tax officials about the value of the company\u2019s assets, inflating them to gain favorable loan terms or minimizing them to reap tax savings.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that our investigation is active and ongoing,\u201d Vance said Tuesday.\n\nJames\u2019 office is involved in Vance\u2019s criminal probe and is conducting its own civil investigation.\n\nSeparately, Trump is facing scrutiny over properties he owns in the New York City suburbs. Westchester County District Attorney Mimi E. Rocah subpoenaed records from the town of Ossining as it investigates whether Trump\u2019s company misled officials to cut taxes for a golf course there, two people familiar with the probe told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nIn Atlanta, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened an investigation in January into possible attempts to interfere with the administration of the state\u2019s 2020 election, which Trump narrowly lost.\n\nIn letters sent in February to top elected officials in the state \u2014 including Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \u2014 Willis instructed them to preserve all records related to the election, particularly those that may contain evidence of attempts to influence election officials.\n\nThe investigation includes a Jan. 2 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger in which Trump repeatedly and falsely asserts that the Republican secretary of state could change the certified results of the presidential election. A recording of the call was obtained the next day by multiple news organizations, including The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause we won the state.\u201d\n\nWillis has been relatively tight-lipped about the investigation, but her office has confirmed it is ongoing.\n\n\u201cAll available evidence is being analyzed, whether gathered by this office, another investigative body or made public by the witnesses themselves. A decision on whether criminal charges are appropriate against any individual will be made when that process is complete,\u201d spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said in an email.\n\nAmong the sources sure to be examined by Willis\u2019 team is a book written by Raffensperger and published Nov. 2. It includes a transcript of the Jan. 2 call with Trump annotated with the secretary of state\u2019s observations, including his belief that the president was threatening him at multiple points.\n\nWillis earlier this year said she was also interested in the circumstances surrounding the sudden resignation on Jan. 4 of Bjay Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta. Pak told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had originally planned to stay in the position until Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, but resigned weeks earlier because of pressure from Trump.\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nThe attorney general for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said early this year that district prosecutors were investigating Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection and considering whether to charge him under a local law that criminalizes statements that motivate people to act violently.\n\nThere has been no indication, however, that that is likely. If Trump were to be charged, it would be a low-level misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence of six months in jail.\n\nLAWSUITS\n\nIn addition to the criminal probes underway, Trump also faces a number of civil suits, from scorned business investors, to his estranged niece, to Democratic lawmakers and Capitol Police officers who blame him for inciting the violence on Jan. 6.\n\nThat includes a lawsuit brought by the House Homeland Security chair, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, under a Reconstruction-era law called the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibits violence or intimidation meant to prevent members of Congress or other federal officials from carrying out their constitutional duties.\n\nIn October, Trump was questioned behind closed doors under oath in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by protesters who say his security team assaulted them outside Trump Tower in the early days of his presidential campaign in 2015.\n\nTrump is also facing a defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll, who says Trump raped her in the mid-1990s in an upscale Manhattan department store. Trump has said that Carroll is \u201ctotally lying\u201d and that she is \u201cnot my type.\u201d U.S. Justice Department lawyers argued earlier this year that Trump cannot be held personally liable for \u201ccrude and disrespectful\u201d remarks he made about a woman who accused him of rape because he made the comments while he was president. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear oral arguments in the case Friday.\n\nTrump had faced a similar defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who had accused Trump of kissing and groping her against her will in 2007, but she unexpectedly dropped the suit last month.\n\nSeparately, Trump\u2019s estranged niece, Mary Trump, has sued him and other family members, accusing them of defrauding her of millions of dollars of inheritance money. Trump has filed his own suit against Mary Trump and The New York Times over a 2018 story about his family\u2019s finances that was based partly on confidential documents she provided to the paper. He accuses her of breaching a settlement agreement that barred her from disclosing the documents.\n\nLawyers for Mary Trump filed paperwork Thursday seeking to dismiss her uncle\u2019s lawsuit against her.",
