          "text": "By Prince Osuagwu, Hi-Tech Editor\n\nThere are serious indications that MTN Nigeria may have paid balance of the $273.6 million 5G license fee to the federal government, even before the 24 February deadline.\n\nStrong sources from the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC told Vanguard yesterday.\n\nThe source said MTN paid the money since two weeks ago but the commission will make the announcement in due time. The source however told Vanguard that Mafab Communications, the second highest bidder was yet to pay as at the time of filing this report.\n\nAlthough the source did not reveal the exact amount MTN paid, Vanguard has done a rough calculation to put it around N106.49bn at the prevailing official exchange rate (N415/$1).\n\nThe amount is to balance with the N7.5 billion, 10 per cent of the reserve price of $197.4 million (N75 billion) which the telco paid as expression of interest before the auction.\n\nRecall that after winning the 5G license, the two winners, MTN and Mafab communications were given until February 24 to pay the license fee or forfeit the non-refundable 10 per cent of the reserve price which they paid as expression of interest before the auction.\n\nOn Monday, December 13, 2021, two telecom operators, MTN Nigeria and Mafab communications emerged winners of Nigeria\u2019s 3.5GHz, fifth generation, 5G license auction.\n\nThe winning price was $273, 600,000 million and the winners were expected to pay on or before February 24, 2022. They were to pay in Naira denomination at the prevailing CBN rate.\n\nAnnouncing result of the auction, Executive Vice Chairman of Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Prof Umar Danbatta, said MTN Nigeria was the highest bidder with additional $15,900,000 million to get Lot 1, while MAFAB Communications added $11,120,000 million to get Lot 2.\n\nThe auction was keenly contested with the three bidders participating actively till the 11th round. The bid opened with $199, 374m, from the reserved bid of $197.4m\n\nThe first round of the auction started at a price of $199, 347,256, second round closed at $201,367,740 million, the third at $204,388,256, the fourth at $209,497,962.50, the fifth at $215,782,901.38, the sixth at $224,414,217.43, seven round at $231, 146,643.96, eight round, $240.392,509.71, round nine at $251,210,176.65, round ten at $263,017,050.77 million, round eleven closed at $275,904,886.25 million.\n\nThe auction started after a brief ceremony where the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ibrahim Pantami , Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC board of directors, Professor Adeolu Akande and Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Professor Umar Danbatta addressed the participants and observers on the imperative of the spectrum auction.\n\nIn his address Pantami traced the journey from 2019 when the 5G technology was tested in Lagos, Abuja and some other cities in Nigeria and found to be suitable and desirable for the country. He also reminded the audience that the test was also followed by an investigation on claims the technology had health dangers. He said the result of the investigation showed 5G technology had no health hazards.\n\nHe expressed optimism that by 2022 Nigeria will have the largest 5G coverage in Africa. He was also of the opinion that 5G, could solve, among others, some of the security challenges in the country, since the technology provides real time services and platforms.\n\nPantami also noted that 5G will go a long way in promoting the economic development of Nigeria, because digital technology is a key enabler of other sectors, especially the financial sector.\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

Her mission is already exposed and our Party is ready to mobilize our members and all patriotic Nigerians across the country by taking legitimate actions to protect the integrity of the electoral body.\n\n\u201cOur party therefore issues a stern caution to Prof. Gumus to, in the interest of peace, steer clear of INEC as there is no way she can function in that office as a card-carrying member of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe party further argued that democracy is about transparency of elections, stressing that \u201cNigerians cannot believe in the integrity of the process with Prof. Gumus in INEC. Her entry and continuing stay in INEC will be toxic and taint the commission with bias and manipulations ahead of the 2023 elections since her appointment and confirmation is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also called on President Buhari to immediately withdraw the appointment, even as it commended civil society organizations for their relentless pursuit of electoral sanity ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chidi Nkwopara, OWERRI.\n\nCatholic Bishops of Owerri Ecclesiastical Province has, at its first plenary meeting of 2022, expressed concern at the frequency of borrowings by federal and state governments, to finance budget shortfalls, as you well as the sit-at-home order.\n\nThis was part of the five-point communiqu\u00e9, issued by the Catholic Bishops, signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Most Rev. Anthony J. V. Obinna and Most Rev Augustine N. Echema, respectively, and made available to newsmen in Owerri.\n\nThe Bishops said: \u201cWe observe with great concern, the frequency with which the Federal and State Governments resort to taking loans, especially foreign ones, to finance their budget shortfalls.\n\n\u201cAt the last count, the Bureau of Statistics in Nigeria has reported that Nigeria currently, is indebted up to the tune of N32 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize the economic need, and sometimes, the necessity of government taking loans, we insist that every responsible Nigerian government, must exercise prudence in the borrowing and management of such loans, so as not to mortgage the future of the nation since, by and large, loans must be repaid.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBREAKING: Bandits kidnap Catholic priest, kill cook in Kaduna\n\nThe clerics also lamented that for so long, the problems facing the country, have remained intractable and the solutions farfetched.\n\nThey said: \u201cToday in Nigeria, we are witnessing terrible darkness in the shape of unreasonable hatred, wickedness, brutality and bloodshed.\n\n\u201cWith the consequent breakdown and failure of governance across the nation, various militant groups terrorists and bandits emerged, foisting a state of anxiety and anarchy, on the whole nation.\n\n\u201cHate and greed-driven violence has thus escalated, leading to the reciprocal mass slaughter of humans, the sacking and burning of homes and settlements, giving rise to many Internally Displaced Persons, IDP. This miserable condition must be addressed before the next elections begin.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a critical look at the nation\u2019s electoral process, the Catholic Bishops expressed hope that Nigerians have another chance to lay the frameworks for the next electoral process.\n\nIn their words: \u201cWe are hopeful that the National Assembly and the Presidency, will put aside their differences and come forward with electoral laws that will help us chart a new pathway that will guarantee free, fair and credible general elections.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the President and members of the National Assembly to \u201cappoint only non-partisan and honest umpires of unassailable integrity to oversee the transitioning process\u201d, the bishops were, however, not happy with the seemingly endless sit at home order in Igboland, every Monday.\n\nIn their considered opinion: \u201cFor some time now, the people of South-East Nigeria, have been forced to sit-at-home on frequent occasions. The situation has become so confusing because some of these orders and counter orders are now being issued and enforced by criminal elements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sit-at-home orders are, however, having a devastating effect on the economic and social life of the people, and adversely affecting their means of livelihood,\u201d He said.\n\nMaking particular reference to education in the South-East geopolitical zone, the bishops opined that it took a serious hit.\n\nThey said: \u201cChildren are kept out of school and learning is carried out under the climate of fear and uncertainty. This status quo cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the government to fulfil its constitutional duty of protecting lives and property and to initiate avenues of dialogue with agitators. We equally appeal to all those indiscriminately issuing orders, to respect the fundamental human rights of those they seek to protect and fight for.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The leader of the emancipation of the Yoruba people in Nigeria is thus kept in the bonds of detention while his file is empty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis only misfortune is to have chosen Benin as a transit country to go to Germany. Prosecuted in Nigeria for his political activities.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSunday Igboho to spend 6 more months in Benin prison\n\n\u201cHe has no intention of committing any act in Benin. He was in transit Benin. The prosecution has not managed to brandish any evidence against him for more than six months. Investigations, in this case, to prove his guilt were unsuccessful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo complaint has been filed against him. More seriously, the government of Nigeria has issued neither an international arrest warrant nor an extradition request against the Yoruba leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet, he is kept in prison and nothing and no one seems to care about his fate except his legal advisers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe detention of Mr Sunday Igboho is no longer justified either for the safety of the people of Benin or for his own safety. This detention violates his fundamental rights and freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the right to come and go of all citizens in member states of the Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the days pass, the Igboho prisoner becomes a bone to the government\u2019s throat,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "University lecturers are heading for another strike over the re-negotiated 2009 agreement with the Federal Government, it was learnt at the weekend.\n\nThere are indications that the National Executive Council of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) will meet on February 14 to review the implementation of some components of the agreement and decide on industrial action.\n\nIt was learnt that the re-negotiated agreement has five components, including funding for revitalisation, autonomy for universities and welfare.\n\nThe committee, which re-negotiated the agreement, was headed by Prof Munzali Jibril, Pro-Chancellor, Federal University Lafia, Nasarawa State and Chairman, Committee of Pro-Chancellors of Federal Universities.\n\nAn ASUU leader, who preferred not to be named, said there had been a lack of progress in the agreement since it was re-negotiated last May.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe source said the government team on the committee proposed certain figures which were adopted with an assurance that the government team had the authorisation to push through the agreement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe government side proposed something (new salary) and ASUU asked the government team if they had the mandate of their principal regarding what they proposed and of course, they answered yes, but said they will have to go back to consult.\n\n\u201cAfter the re-negotiation had been concluded, they said they had to go back and discuss with their principal. That is where we are with negotiations on all five chapters.\n\n\u201cThe five chapters of the 2009 FG-ASUU are funding for revitalisation, the autonomy of universities, welfare of lecturers and four and five are related. These are things we bring up each time we go on strike.\n\n\u201cLet them go and sign the re-negotiated 2009 agreement. It has always been like this with the government.\n\n\u201cThe antics of government regarding ASUU is always like this: We go on strike for government to come to the table for us to negotiate. After concluding the negotiation, we always have to go on strike for them to sign it and again go on strike for them to implement.\n\n\u201cIt has always been like this right from 1992. It is not new; it is the character of the government.\n\n\u201cWhat is playing out now is what has been since 1992. Three stages: you will go on strike for them to negotiate, you will go on strike to get them to sign the agreement that they willingly negotiated then the final stage you go on strike to get them to implement.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be the last strike. People should know that because after this, there will be another strike probably for them to implement that agreement.\u201d\n\nASUU President Prof Emmanuel Osodeke dismissed as mere promises the comments by President Muhammadu Buhari that the Federal Government was committed to meeting ASUU\u2019s demands to prevent another round of strikes.\n\nOsodeke said the appeal for understanding by the president was a mere promise they have heard before.\n\nThe ASUU President, in an interview with The Nation in Abuja, said most of the demands of the union have not been met by the Federal Government.\n\nHe listed some of the demands to include: non-signing of the re-negotiated FGN-ASUU 2009 agreement, non-payment of the balance of Earned Academic Allowances, non-deployment of UTAS, non-payment of lecturers on sabbatical, and proliferation of universities by state governments.\n\nBuhari had, during a meeting with members of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council, led by Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Abubakar III and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, said the Federal Government was committed to honouring promises made to ASUU to prevent strikes in universities.\n\nThe President also appealed to the union to note the fiscal pressures that the government was currently facing.\n\nThe ASUU President accused government officials of wasting resources on foreign trips.\n\nHe said ASUU leadership would meet soon to take a decision.\n\nOsodeke said: \u201cWe have heard him so many times and nothing happened. Except when we start seeing something concrete being done the plea will just be like any other plea we have heard; mere promises.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf they are correct, no problem. But, are they correct? Is he correct that there is no fund? Are we not seeing things that are covering billions of naira? Bailing out banks, and others and having multiple travels by governors, principal officers of government \u2013 all consuming dollars?\n\n\u201cIf education is really the priority of this government, would we be saying there is no fund? How many countries in the world allocate five or six per cent of their budget to education?\n\n\u201cNigeria is the country that allocates the lowest budget to education. That is the problem because they don\u2019t believe in it because their children are not in this country.\n\n\u201dIf their children were here and probably in public universities today, they would not be treating education like this. In some countries, they give 25 to 30 per cent of their budget allocation to education, but Nigeria is six per cent.\n\nThe budget is even worse than it was. This is the problem we are having. We speak and we don\u2019t implement.\n\n\u201cThe allocation in the 2022 budget is less than what was given in the 2021 budget. This is why people don\u2019t really believe in what the government is saying.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting soon and the NEC of the union will take a decision.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU president also chided the Federal Government for failing to implement the re-negotiated FG-ASUU 2009 agreement.\n\nOsodeke said 10 months after negotiations on the agreement were concluded, the Federal Government has failed to take action.\n\n\u201dThe most important one is the issue of the 2009 FGN-ASUU Agreement. We agreed that we will negotiate the agreement up till now, nothing has happened.\n\n\u201cLast year, ASUU and the government reached an agreement and a draft for signing and they reverted back to their principal. Up till now they have not come back to us on whether they agree or not, since May last year \u2013 that is almost 10 months now; nothing has been done,\u201d Prof Osodeke said.\n\nHe also accused the government of failing to deploy the University Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS) \u2013 the payment platform developed by the university lecturers despite passing the integrity test conducted by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) last year.\n\nProf Osodeke said: \u201cWe have the issue of UTAS. Thank God, everybody has confirmed that IPPIS is a fraud. The Auditor \u2013 General of the Federation has confirmed that it is a fraud; just to siphon money and they are telling lies. And we said we will give them an alternative which the government agreed they will implement if we produce it.\n\n\u201cWe produced and went for a test. Even with their fraudulent test, it passed more than 80 per cent of the test. Yet, they are not implementing.\n\n\u201cThe major fraud that we have found out is that in order to ensure that the thing doesn\u2019t go in, they started inputting things that are not our own; even plagiarising people\u2019s work. People who have done some work and they were negative, they went and plagiarise it, picked it word for word and put it and reported it negative and we have all the evidence.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile the IPPIS that has been ruining the country was never tested by NITDA, they just brought it and implemented it and we are seeing the adverse effects today as reported by the Auditor General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nHe also said the Federal Government was yet to release the arrears of Earned Academic Allowances since May last year.\n\n\u201cWe also have the issue of Earned Academic Allowances. We have arrears. The government said they have mainstreamed it. So, we are looking at this year\u2019s budget. But, there are still a lot of arrears remaining.\n\n\u201cAnd the government promised they were going to give a tranche in May last year. Until now that tranche was not released.\n\n\u201cThe visitation panel report that was set up early last year \u2013 February, till now the white paper has not been released. Which means something is going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ASUU leader added: \u201cNone of the issues have been fully resolved. Some of our members are still owed between two, three and give months. Those who are on sabbatical are not even earning their money.\n\n\u201dOur colleagues who were promoted two or three years ago have not gotten the arrears of their promotion. You know in academics when you are promoted, those in the professorial cadre will have to go for external assessment and by the time they come, the actual date of implementation would have been exceeded and the arrears are paid. Till now, nothing is being paid.\n\n\u201cSome people who have been promoted can\u2019t even get their main salary; the Accountant \u2013 General\u2019s office pay them whatever they like through their so-called IPPIS.\n\n\u201cAll the issues are still on board. State governors are still proliferating universities when they cannot fund the ones they have. Abia State recently announced a new university. Meanwhile, the one they have they cannot fund it. These are the issues, none have been implemented.\u201d",
          "summary": "University lecturers are heading for another strike over the re-negotiated 2009 agreement with the Federal Government, it was learnt at the weekend.\nIt was learnt that the re-negotiated agreement has five components, including funding for revitalisation, autonomy for universities and welfare.\n\u201cLet them go and sign the re-negotiated 2009 agreement.\nThe ASUU President, in an interview with The Nation in Abuja, said most of the demands of the union have not been met by the Federal Government.\nThe ASUU President accused government officials of wasting resources on foreign trips.",

          "title": "Amended Electoral Bill Bars Ministers, Commissioners from Contesting in Primaries",
          "text": "*Bill prescribes sanctions for erring parties\n\n*Advises aggrieved potential aspirants to approach federal high court for relief\n\n*Says judicial pronouncement can\u2019t stop primary or general election\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nShould President Muhammadu Buhari sign the new Electoral Act amendment bill recently forwarded to him by the National Assembly into law, all political appointees in his government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nThe implication is that some key ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, said to be nursing presidential ambitions would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties.\n\nWhat this therefore, means is that ministers, commissioners and other political appointees are expected to resign ahead of their parties\u2019 primaries in order to be eligible to contest in the primaries.\n\nTop on the list of the aspiring appointees to be affected by this new amendment are the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. They are believed to have presidential ambitions, even though they have yet to declare their interests.\n\nBut by the provision at issue, political appointees are also barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace is no longer available.\n\nHowever, with the new amendment, if signed by the President, they would henceforth be required to vacate office completely before being eligible to contest.\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nBut there appears to be a lacuna in the new law, which may encourage infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources believe the clause is meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often control those who become automatic delegates and determine the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d refrain of the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many is that, with a clause that clearly breaches the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again. If this happens, a new electoral law may not be ready for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Assembly had recently transmitted the new Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill to Buhari for assent, through the Clerk of the National Assembly, Olatunde Ojo. Before the latest transmission, Buhari had in December 2021, vetoed the former amendment bill, leading to a recommittal by the National Assembly.\n\nThere have been misgivings about the new amendment, fuelling speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law. The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThe harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature was considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives on the amendment to Clause 84 of the bill.\n\nIn this clause, the direct, indirect and consensus modes of primary election by political parties were included. This was after the controversy that trailed the different versions initially approved by the two chambers.\n\nThe senate had in its re-amended bill approved direct, indirect, and consensus primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, while the House only provided direct and indirect modes, saying the president did not speak about the consensus option, when he vetoed the previous bill.\n\nBut President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, while presiding at plenary, stated that both chambers had agreed to give a clear and sufficient definition for each mode of primary, and how they would be conducted.\n\nLawan explained that for the consensus method, the two chambers produced a clear-cut definition on how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fitch: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector Weak Performance May Slowdown Economic Growth",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFitch Solutions, an affiliate of global rating agency, Fitch, has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s weak performance in the oil and gas sector may continue to slow down the country\u2019s economy in the coming years. In its latest report on the state of the Nigerian economy, the rating agency stated that from its analysis, the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) might not markedly impact the country in the near term.\n\nForecasting an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent in the next four years, the group added that given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, it expected that average incomes would continue to stagnate in the country.\n\nFitch stated, \u201cWhile the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was finally signed in 2021, will create a more stable operating environment, we doubt that it will have a significant effect on investment this year. It will take time for foreign firms to launch any new projects.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite the new bill, our oil and gas team expects that oil production will gradually fall over the coming years. We predict an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent between 2023 and 2026. All told, fixed investment spending will contribute just 0.6 per cent to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report projected that the poor performance of the oil sector, which is Nigeria\u2019s key foreign exchange earner, would keep headline growth weak over the coming years.\n\nThe rating agency said, \u201cWe expect that real GDP growth will average just 2.9 per cent between 2023 and 2026. Headline growth will be even weaker in per capita terms. Given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, we expect that average incomes will continue to stagnate.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the slowdowns, Fitch predicted that economic growth in Nigeria would pick up slightly from an estimated 3.1 per cent in 2021, to 3.5 per cent in 2022, primarily driven by increased oil production, which will boost export growth. But the firm stated that it expected that growth would slow to 2.9 per cent in 2023, and over the medium term, that the combination of poor economic performance and rapid population growth per capita income would essentially stagnate.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe at Fitch Solutions expect Nigeria\u2019s economy will expand by 3.5 per cent in 2022. This would be the eighth consecutive year in which Nigeria has underperformed the aggregate growth figure for Emerging Markets (EM). We expect growth of 4.8 per cent across EMs as a whole.\n\n\u201cEven so, 3.5 per cent growth would represent an acceleration compared to the 3.1 per cent growth for 2021, and be Nigeria\u2019s best performance since 2014.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fitch solutions predicted that the volume of Nigeria\u2019s oil production would rise by 4.1 per cent in 2022, which would be a significant improvement compared to 2021, when it estimated that output fell by 8.1 per cent as a result of low investment and OPEC+ cuts.\n\nThe report said, \u201cBut with the OPEC+ agreement now ending, we think that output will rise, though it will remain below the recent peak recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cSince oil makes up almost 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s exports, increased production will boost the country\u2019s export earnings. Indeed, given rising agricultural exports, we expect that exports will rise by 11.6 per cent in real terms in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhereas net exports subtracted 1.0 percentage points (pps) from headline growth in 2021, we think that the component will add 1.8pps to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, the slow but rising oil production would also fuel strong private consumption growth, spurring private consumption spending to rise by 3.5 per cent in 2022, in line with the outturn in 2021.\n\nThe report explained, \u201cThis will contribute 2.2pps to headline growth. Continued FX shortages and slow productivity growth in the agricultural sector \u2013 which employs almost 35.0 per cent of the workforce \u2013 will prevent a sharper acceleration. Indeed, over the past seven years, private consumption growth has averaged just 0.7 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe expect that government consumption will rise by 3.0 per cent in 2022. The government passed an ambitious budget in late 2021, but recent experience suggests that implementation will be very weak.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, sceptical about plans to significantly increase public infrastructure spending.\n\nIndeed, some projects were probably included in the budget for political reasons before the 2023 election, and we expect that very little real progress will be made. Given the small scale of Nigeria\u2019s federal government, public spending will contribute just 0.4pp to headline growth.\u201d\n\nIt emphasised that the government\u2019s failure to raise living standards would probably result in increased social tensions over the coming years, projecting that the febrile political environment can result in violence surrounding presidential elections scheduled for 2023.\n\n\u201cOur current forecasts assume that the vote passes peacefully, but a series of violent clashes \u2013 as happened in 2011 \u2013 could pose a headwind to real GDP growth,\u201d it projected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Osinbajo to Announce Presidential Bid after APC Convention",
          "text": "* Secures go-ahead of his spiritual father\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has concluded plans to announce his presidential ambition immediately after the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nSources close to Osinbajo\u2019s strategy team hinted at the weekend that in spite of the ongoing campaigns against his currently rumoured bid for the presidency by some interests in the South-west, where he hails from, Osinbajo had made up his mind to give the presidency a shot.\n\nEven more instructive, inside sources claimed, was the fact that Osinbajo had received the blessing and the charge to go ahead with his ambition from his spiritual father and General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye.\n\nThe source said, \u201cTake it to the bank, he will run and he is declaring soon after the APC convention. All is set, including premium consultations already done. The coast is clear and the journey is looking good. I believe prof is also motivated by the increasing level of support from across the country, especially, the youths of this country.\n\n\u201cFrom the north to the south, tell me where he has visited recently and the charge has not been that he should contest? He has capacity, competence and knows what the issues are. Importantly, he can also sell them \u2013 I mean the issues. So, why will he not run? Why should the bitterness and envy of some minions stifle him?\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, who sources said was unfazed by the growing allegation of betrayal and the push for him to stand down his ambition for his former principal and supposed benefactor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had since declared his intention to run, was said to have described the attacks against him as the real motivation to take his chances.\n\nThe source added, \u201cIn fact, none of such bothers him. But he has done one thing though, he has called his supporters and pleaded with them never to talk down on Tinubu or engage in a mud fight with his support groups, even in the face of obvious provocation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Osinbajo has refused to officially talk about his aspiration, despite the growing support for him to succeed Buhari, he is said to have been holding high level consultations with prominent Nigerians, many of whom have encouraged him to give the aspiration his best shot possible.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Osinbajo\u2019s motivation to run for the presidency in 2023 stemmed from the first time he acted as president, when Buhari was away on medical leave to London, during which he took far-reaching decisions in the national interest. It was further gathered that taking active charge during the period provided the vice president both the confidence and impetus to desire to succeed his current boss.\n\nAn APC member, who is favourably disposed to Osinbajo\u2019s aspiration, stated, \u201cIt may be right to admit he stands a really good chance to succeed President Buhari after eight years as his deputy. He is an insider, who has had the opportunity of seeing things from high and serious vantage position, especially, having acted before on behalf of his boss.\n\n\u201cAlthough that may not be enough to get the presidency of Nigeria, because I believe and I know there are some politics directly connected to being the president of Nigeria. But, how well Osinbajo fits into that conversation is another debate altogether. From the list of those currently strutting the turf, he stands a really good chance, except the election is not his to lose.\n\n\u201cBut, file this away, he is contesting and would declare after the APC convention. I am aware of that. There\u2019s actually no stopping him. The supports have been sweeping and encouraging and for him, this opportunity might just be once and might never come his way again. Sincerely, he has nothing to lose throwing his hat in the ring. After all, he is already a frontline aspirant.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was true that Adeboye had given his blessing, the party chieftain, who would rather maintain anonymity, stated, \u201cI am not privy to that, but it\u2019s also a simple logic. Osinbajo is a pastor in Redeem and Baba Adeboye would never leave one of his own to support someone else. I also believe he must have hinted him. Honestly, the days ahead will be interesting.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Lai Mohammed, Ngige, Okorocha, Wamakko, Abe\u2019s factions spit fire\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nDespite last Thursday\u2019s inauguration of the state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 34 states at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja, the tussles over the control of the party structures have remained unabated in no fewer than 13 states, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nThe affected states include Zamfara, Sokoto, Delta, Rivers, Anambra, Imo, Enugu, Ogun and Kwara.\n\nOthers include Osun, Kano, Bauchi and Kebbi states.\n\nVarious factions of the party led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magartada Wamakko; former Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero, and Senator Magnus Abe, have faulted the action of the national leadership of the party.\n\nAbe\u2019s faction in Rivers State has warned that the division in the party and the recognition of the faction led by the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi could lead to the exclusion of the party in the 2023 general election like in 2019.\n\nThe ruling party did not inaugurate the leadership of the party in Sokoto State, which is being contested by three factions led by a former governor of the state, Senator Wamakko; a member of the House of Representatives representing Illela/ Gwadabawa Federal Constituency, Hon. Balarabe Salame, Speaker of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida; and Senator Abubukar Gada, who leads his faction.\n\nWhile Wamakko leads one faction, Salame and Achida are in one faction.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Wamakko has six National Assembly members, a senator, and 13 members of the state House of Assembly in his faction.\n\nBut Salame, Achida and Gada\u2019s factions have the backing of chieftains of the party based in Abuja.\n\nWhen contacted, the Chairman of Wamakko\u2019s faction, Alhaji Isa Sadiq Achida told THISDAY that nobody can truncate the will of the people of the state.\n\nHe further explained that those ranting that Wamakko has hijacked the party cannot win even an electoral ward for the party.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that if you remove Wamakko from APC in Sokoto, the party is dead because Wamakko is the party and the party is Wamakko,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, another factional leader of the party in the state, Salame alleged that Wamakko sat down in his house and wrote the names of the executives and submitted it to the party headquarters.\n\nHe further alleged that the party lost the governorship election in 2019 \u201cbecause of Wamakko\u2019s handedness. He imposed an unpopular candidate, which made us lose the governorship seat.\u201d\n\nIn Zamfara State, the APC faction led by Senator Kabir Garba Marafa had described the recognition of the faction led by Governor Bello Matawalle as an act of impunity by the national leadership of the party.\n\nIn a statement issued by the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Bello Bakkyasuwa Maradun titled: \u2018We enjoy watching APC\u2019s parade of madness,\u2019 the faction stated that the action of the party\u2019s caretaker and extraordinary convention planning committee would cause chaos in the party.\n\nHe predicted that APC would soon collapse because of impunity thriving in it.\n\n\u201cThe saying \u2018the wages of sin is death\u2019 applies perfectly in the most recent action of the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of presenting certificates to their selected chairpersons of state chapters of the party. As one of the many factions across the country with legitimate grounds for agitation, the Senator Marafa-led faction of APC in Zamfara State sees this action as desperate and negates all principles of strategic thinking for building an enduring party that can weather the storm of 2023 as President Buhari rightly warned.\u201d\n\nIn Delta State, members of the party opposed to the faction led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, have also kicked against the inauguration of Mr Omeni Sobotie as the state chairman.\n\nAccording to them, the so-called inauguration ceremony that took place in Abuja on Thursday was merely a sham as it did not follow due process, including the proper administration of the oath of office and oath of allegiance before competent officials.\n\nEminent chieftains of the party allegedly \u201cshut out\u201d of the process of the different party congresses by the Omo-Agege group include Dr Cairo Ojougboh; the 2019 APC governorship candidate, Chief Great Ogboru; former Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly and Executive Director at NIMASA, Chief Victor Ochei; and the National Women Leader, Dr Mariam Alli.\n\nThe (factional) state Deputy Chairman of the anti-Omo-Agege faction, Hon. Elvis Ayomanor told THISDAY in Asaba that the national secretariat of the party Abuja has not confirmed Sobotie as the authentic chairman of the state chapter of the APC because the appropriate Oath of Office was not administered to him and his counterparts from other states.\n\nA factional chairman of the party in Rivers State, Golden Chioma, has also faulted the inauguration of the chairman of the faction loyal to the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nChioma said what APC needed was an inclusive party and not a divisive party.\n\nThe APC chieftain told THISDAY that the party leadership at the national level ignored a faction to protect the interest of the other faction, stressing that one individual cannot continue to control party structure in the state.\n\nChioma who belongs to Senator Magnus Abe-led faction further urged the party leadership to avoid making the same mistake that led to the experience of 2019 where APC was removed from the electoral process over the internal crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for anything, but an inclusive party. The division in my APC in Rivers State is the oldest in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you remember, in 2019, the party did not present any candidate based on this same division. So, we need to do something different. We need to be more inclusive and not divisive,\u201d Chioma added.\n\nA faction of the APC in Anambra State led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has also rejected the inauguration of Mr Basil Ejidike as the state chairman.\n\nThe state secretary of the party, Mr Chukwuma Agufugo, who belongs to Ngige\u2019s faction, has dismissed Ejidike\u2019s executive, saying it would not stand.\n\nAgufugo said Ejidike and his co-travellers have violated the order of the court, describing it as contempt, and vowed that they must pay for it.\n\nAlso, the factional Publicity Secretary, Mr Okelo Madukaife insisted that Ejidike and his executives remained rejected.\n\nHe said it was not true that the executives of the Anambra State chapter of the party had been inaugurated.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur dynamic chapter of APC congratulates the national leadership of our great party for the wisdom contained in the decision not to swear in anybody as Chairman of Anambra State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cThis noble decision validates the position of the mainstream of our party in Anambra State that 2018 officials remain in charge of our affairs until congresses can hold as leadership abhors a vacuum.\u201d\n\nIn Imo State, a faction of the APC led by Senator Rochas Okorocha said it would rely heavily on the ruling of the Appeal Court of November 6, 2020.\n\nThe chairman of the faction, Mr Dan Nwafor told THISDAY that the recognition of the Governor Hope Uzodimma\u2019s faction, which has Macdonald Ebere as chairman was contempt of court.\n\nA former Caretaker Committee Chairman of the party in Enugu State, Mr Ben Nwoye, has also argued that Mr Ude Agaballa, another factional chairman, who was inaugurated in Abuja, was not sworn in.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Nwoye who said he monitored the inauguration, explained that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led reconciliation committee had listened to the complaints, reports, and petitions of aggrieved party members, adding that when Agballa\u2019s name was mentioned in Abuja, he was directed to go back because he did not win any congress.\n\nNwoye noted that Agballa was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who only came in August 2021 and expressed his interest to join the APC.\n\nThe Chairman of APC faction loyal to a former Governor of Ogun State Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Chief Derin Adebiyi, told THISDAY that his faction would hold a meeting to determine the next line of action.\n\nThe APC had sworn in Chief Yemi Sanusi, Chairman of a faction loyal to the state Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the faction led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Kwara State, Hon. Sunday Oyebiyi told THISDAY that the inauguration of Prince Sunday Fagbemi was an exercise in futility, which would not take the party anywhere during the next elections.\n\n\u201cIt is a kangaroo outing that would not bring out the result to the party leadership both at the national secretariat and state chapter of APC.\n\n\u201cThe development shows that the national leadership of APC is unserious one and when the time comes, all of them will see it.\n\n\u201cI know it is not only in Kwara State but some other states where injustice is greatly pervaded by the governors over the control of the party and when the time comes, they will all see the outcome of their actions,\u201d he explained.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that in Kebbi State, a faction of the party led by Senator Adamu Aliero, representing Kebbi Central, which lost out during the inauguration, has vowed to resist the alleged imposition of party leadership in the state.\n\nA faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, in Osun State, has also refused to recognise the new leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts by the national caretaker committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni to reconcile and put an end to the crisis rocking the Kano chapter of the party has hit another brick wall last week.\n\nTHISDAY investigation revealed that the peace meeting was the second in one week brokered at the instance of Buni-led APC to reach a compromise on the leadership of the APC in Kano.\n\nHowever, the peace meeting which was held on Friday night in Abuja ended in a stalemate as the leadership tussle rocking the Kano State chapter of the party continues.\n\nThe peace meeting could not resolve the leadership tussle as the Ibrahim Shekarau faction insisted that it should be accorded recognition having been pronounced as the valid leadership by a court judgment.\n\nInvestigation further revealed that efforts to prevail on the Shekarau faction already accorded recognition a court to accept the harmonisation deal by the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje faction was rebuffed by Shekarau\u2019s team.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Professor Rhoda Gumus as National Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC).\n\n\n\nLast month, President Muhammadu Buhari announced his choice of Gumus, a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to replace Lauretta Onochie, his social media aide.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nShe was subsequently confirmed by the Senate weeks after.\n\n\n\nReacting in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the PDP described the action as a coup against the country\u2019s democracy.\n\n\n\nThe party said the Senate has exposed itself as anti-people and completely insensitive to the aspiration of Nigerians for credible and transparent elections in 2023.\n\nSee Also Politics Again, Buhari Nominates Another APC Member As INEC Commissioner\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vehemently rejects the confirmation of a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prof. Rhoda Gumus, as a National Commissioner (South-South) in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) despite widespread outcry by Nigerians\n\n\n\n\u201cThe PDP describes Prof. Gumus\u2019 confirmation as INEC National Commissioner by the APC-led Senate leadership as a \u2018coup\u2019 against Democracy and an open invitation to a serious political crisis that can derail our hard-earned democracy and lead to a breakdown of law and order if not immediately reversed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn confirming Prof. Gumus, the APC-led Senate leadership has exposed itself as anti-people and completely insensitive to the aspiration of Nigerians for credible and transparent elections in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe action of the APC-led Senate is highly provocative and incendiary because it is in violation of Paragraph 14 (2)(a) of the 3rd Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides that \u2018a member of the Commission shall be non-partisan and a person of unquestionable integrity\u2019.\n\nSee Also Politics Activist Petitions Nigerian Senate Over APC Member Nominated By Buhari As INEC Commissioner\n\n\u201cSuch violent assault on the Constitution and our electoral process by the APC cannot be allowed to stand. The media space is awash with reports of Prof. Gumus as a member of the APC in Bayelsa State with APC Registration Form No: BAY/YEN/08/58315 and reportedly as number 27 in her APC Ward Register.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn nominating and confirming an APC card-carrying member into INEC, President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC-led Senate leadership have recklessly violated the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which they swore to uphold and defend.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis action is designed to corrupt and compromise the electoral Commission and pave the way for the APC to rig the 2023 general elections. Nigerians can recall how President Buhari had earlier sought to impose his aide and card-carrying member of the APC, Lauretta Onochie as INEC Commissioner but was stiffly resisted by Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC which thrives in impunity has again nominated and confirmed Prof. Gumus, another APC card-carrying member as National Commissioner in INEC in flagrant violation of the Constitution and total disregard for the Nigerian people. Prof. Gumus must not be allowed to be used to pollute INEC. Her mission is already exposed and our Party is ready to mobilize our members and all patriotic Nigerians across the country by taking legitimate actions to protect the integrity of the electoral body.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur Party, therefore, issues a stern caution to Prof. Gumus to, in the interest of peace, steer clear of INEC as there is no way she can function in that office as a card-carrying member of the APC. Democracy is about the transparency of elections. Nigerians cannot believe in the integrity of the process with Prof. Gumus in INEC. Her entry and continuing stay in INEC will be toxic and taint the Commission with bias and manipulations ahead of the 2023 elections since her appointment and confirmation is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe PDP calls on President Buhari to immediately withdraw the appointment of Prof. Gumus as INEC National Commissioner in line with his oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This will assure Nigerians that Mr. President is committed to free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe PDP salutes and commends the efforts of the Civil Society which continues to remain relentless in the fight for a credible electoral process from appointment of officers of INEC, processes of election as well as the collation and declaration of election results.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur Party urges the Civil Society and all well-meaning Nigerians to continue to insist that appointments into INEC must be transparent and in line with the provisions of the Constitution and other relevant laws.\u201d",

So, the conversation has been how to bring together a number of people to front what I call the \u2018Coalition of the Willing and the Dispossessed\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is an amazing array of Nigerians. By the way, for the first time, civil societies are ready to be inside of the arena. They played as civil society in the past but civil society is coming in.

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s identity management agency wants to replace ID numbers with digital tokens",
          "text": "In August 2014, Nigeria\u2019s former president Goodluck Jonathan launched a new national identity project. The new e-ID card was supposed to be the super app of civil registers and traditional ID cards, combining digitally verifiable identification with the ability to make electronic payments, and even withdraw cash at ATMs.\n\nLong story short, it flopped. As had a previous attempt made 10 years prior.\n\nA 2019 court order finally put a temporary halt to new card issuance after a paltry 1.2 million cards had been issued. NIMC then switched attention from e-cards to simply issuing paper-printed National Identification Numbers (NINs). So far, NIMC has successfully registered over 71 million Nigerian residents and citizens, representing roughly 35% of the population.\n\nNow Nigeria\u2019s identity management office is rolling out the next phase of its ambitious digital ID programme, a virtual e-ID that anonymises the personally identifiable information used for KYC verification.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s a long-overdue milestone, and on the other hand, it is a confidence signal that the government is serious about digitally ID-ing Nigerians.\n\nWhy are digital IDs important?\n\nGenerally speaking, legal identification is important. People have the right to be recognised legally by their government for social protection, financial inclusion, and migration. Identification is how people prove that recognition. Theoretically, what digital IDs do is simply replace paper records with digitally stored and accessible ID databases.\n\nOf course, today\u2019s digital IDs do much more than simply recognise and authenticate identity claims. Some governments want them to serve as intermediaries between the population and access to basic services.\n\nIndia\u2019s Aadhaar number is a good example of a widely successful digital identity project. Aadhaar now covers 99% of Indian adults, a huge feat in itself, given the country\u2019s huge population. According to K. Sudhir and Shyam Sunder, both faculty members at Yale, \u201cBecause of Aadhaar, many have gained access to public services they had long been entitled to. Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.\u201d\n\nSubsidies and food aid, which used to be diverted through \u201cghost\u201d recipients, now go to the people who need them, and rural-urban migrants are able to access an entire suite of services that would otherwise be challenging to access. In Malawi, fingerprinting for credit disbursement helped reduce loan default rates and supported repayment behaviour.\n\nHowever, untokenised unique identifying numbers (UINs), like Nigeria\u2019s NIN, can leave people vulnerable to privacy abuses since the individual has one identifying number which follows them across every database they interact with. For example, NIMC recommends that Nigerians not share their NIN, but the same NIN is one of the channels for verifying customer identity.\n\nA digital token is that crucial additional layer that prevents personally identifiable information (PII) from being recorded while allowing a company to securely verify the user\u2019s identity. My earlier example, India\u2019s Aadhaar, is tokenised in a similar way as NIMC intends. What is more? India\u2019s Reserve Bank has even asked all service providers to tokenise card and card-on-file storage, but that\u2019s a story for another day. The point is, tokenisation is an important component of privacy protection.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nImproving data privacy\n\nIn 2019, following the footsteps of Europe, Nigeria\u2019s National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) issued the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). The NDPR was largely based on the European example, but some analysts argue that it is inadequate and lacks sufficient legal status, as it is not a law. That flaw, combined with the fact that a proposed data protection bill was abandoned by the federal government late last year, has allowed a legal grey zone for how data is handled in Nigeria.\n\nFor example, private companies might handle, store, or even sell personal data in ways that are not only unethical but legally grey. A NIN token prevents that from even happening instead of simply relying on the honor code illusion.\n\nBy tokenising the authentication process, NIMC is helping to prevent users\u2019 personally identifiable information from being accessed and stored unethically by private companies.\n\nNow NIMC has asked service providers to only verify NIN tokens, not the actual NINs. This KYC policy update means that startups, telcos, and the organisations that use NIN will need to update their onboarding processes and app interfaces to be able to verify NIN tokens. According to Kasim Sodangi, Head of Compliance, NITDA, using NIN tokens to verify user identities will be cheaper for private companies\u2019 KYC.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nUsers can create NIN tokens from NIMC\u2019s mobile application or generate the tokens via USSD (*346*3*Your NIN*AgentCode#). Agent codes are like unique merchant numbers that identify the service provider requesting the verification. This means that tokens generated for merchant X can only be used for that merchant and remain valid for only 72 hours.\n\nWhat does this mean for service providers?\n\nIn general terms, nothing much changes. Service providers can still use the Bank Verification Number (BVN) or any other KYC verification channel to authenticate users\u2019 identities. The only big change applies to startups that require NIN for KYC. Such companies will have to apply as enterprises to get unique merchant keys with which they can verify virtual NINs or tokens. Or use KYC verification services like Smile Identity to access NIMC\u2019s API. NIMC also says using the service will be cheaper than using BVNs for KYC.\n\nNIMC launched the NIN tokens in January, and while telcos and Nigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PENCOM) have begun dry runs of the new process, Usman Abiola, Principal Product Manager at Smile Identity says they were yet to try the product and expected to get access later in February. NIMC has issued over 70 million NINs despite debilitating trust issues and a generally poor service infrastructure. A lot of that success comes from the mandated linking of NINs to individual SIM cards. Tokenisation will protect people\u2019s personal data, for sure, but that is only one part of the enormous work needed to fix data protection and enforcement in Nigeria.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Say hello, and we\u2019ll share a fun article with you \ud83d\ude04\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Dangote Refinery to curb petrol import, subsidy impact muted",
          "text": "The current expectation is that the incoming Dangote Refinery will solve all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy woes, the government thinks, but findings by BusinessDay show otherwise.\n\nAfter years of hopes and delays, Dangote Refinery, expected to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery and the world\u2019s biggest single-train facility, is expected to start with a processing capacity of 540,000 barrels per day between August and September 2022, while full production is expected at the beginning of 2023.\n\nWith the hype and hope, many Nigerians already think the project would reverse the government\u2019s expensive subsidy practice and save foreign exchange so much so that it would reduce the pump price of petroleum products, but Biodun Adedipe, an economist and chief consultant, BAA Consult, thinks otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery will not solve the myriad of challenges bedevilling Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector such as lack of transparency, accountability, the domineering stature,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Adedipe, the Dangote Refinery is built on dollar-denominated loans, which means the project would focus more on speedily generating the dollars to services and repay those loans rather than selling cheap petrol.\n\nAt the project\u2019s launch less than a decade ago, the refinery was expected to cost $9 billion. By 2019, it ballooned to $15 billion. Now analysts say the figure is an estimated $19 billion, which is a combination of equity and debt.\n\n\u201cThe pump price of petrol from Dangote Refinery will reflect the market price of crude and cost of production, which will not be static at any point,\u201d Adedipe notes.\n\nIsrael Aye, the managing partner of the Commercial and Energy Law Practice (CELP) believes that \u201cthe only difference that would happen if Nigeria\u2019s supply was coming from in-country would have been the freight price. But whether it is coming from outside or coming from within, it will be about the same cost because when you import, the only difference is that you will have to pay the freight.\u201d\n\nAs of February 1, 2022, the upturn in the price of Brent Crude pushed the landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) imported into Nigeria to over N282 per liter, thanks to a freight cost of $26.77 per MT (N8.31 per liter), according to finding from Platts.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like an opportunity for buying things at a cheaper price, it will be based on the international standard,\u201d Bello Rabiu, formerly the chief operating officer, Upstream at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), states.\n\nOther cost elements that make up the landing cost include lightering expenses (N4.81), Nigerian Ports Authority charge (N2.49), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency charge (N0.23), jetty throughput charge (N1.61), storage charge (N2.58), and financing (N2.17).\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, the pump price is the sum of the landing cost, wholesaler margin (N4.03), admin charge (N1.23), transporters allowance (N3.89), bridging fund (N7.51), marine transport average (N0.15), and retailer margin (N6.19).\n\n\u201cThe hope the Dangote Refinery brings is refreshing but relying on a single project to rescue the oil and gas sector of the world\u2019s 13th-largest crude producer points to the years of neglect that has riddled the sector and its damming frailty,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), says.\n\nOther experts are unanimous in their views that full deregulation would, in the long run, benefit ordinary Nigerians, and positively change the industry\u2019s fortunes forever if the government put the right structures in place.\n\n\u201cWithout full deregulation in Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector, we shouldn\u2019t expect any miracle,\u201d Nwakwue states.\n\nAt a recent foreign investors\u2019 meeting in New York, the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s import of petroleum products that accounted for 30 percent of its forex could be reversed by the successful commencement of operations at the Dangote Refinery.\n\nRead also: Dangote\u2019s giant Oil Refinery to Begin Production in Third Quarter of 2022\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery once it begins production would be a major FX saving source for Nigeria,\u201d the governor said, adding that \u201cif the 650,000\u201d daily barrels that will be produced from the refinery will \u201cbe sold in naira it would be a major FX saver for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, also thinks the Dangote Refinery will not solve all of Nigeria\u2019s problems in the downstream petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cDangote Refinery as a silver bullet to solving Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange problem is a misunderstanding of the facts. It will help in reducing refining cost, it will help in reducing transportation cost but it is the oil that you are going to export that will give you a dollar,\u201d Rewane said during a panel session at the IMF\u2019s Public Presentation of the fall 2021 Issue of the Regional Economic Outlook.\n\nThis is however not to say the huge refinery will not have any impact at all.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show if the Dangote Refinery operations go as announced, the refinery would add 0.6 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2022 with an estimate of 2.7 percent increase to 3.3 percent.\n\nFurther estimates show the refinery would add 2.2 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2023, based on an estimate of 2.8 percent increase to 5.0 percent.\n\nThe criteria for these estimates are based on a conservative assumption that if the refinery starts in 2022 it will produce 10 percent of total capacity, 20 percent next year, and achieve full capacity after 2025.\n\nPundits believe the refinery should enable Nigeria to break free from the import of petroleum products and employ a large chunk of its unemployed youths. A piece of good news for the leading oil producer on the continent, which has faced several oil shortages.",

But whether it is coming from outside or coming from within, it will be about the same cost because when you import, the only difference is that you will have to pay the freight.\u201d\n\nAs of February 1, 2022, the upturn in the price of Brent Crude pushed the landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) imported into Nigeria to over N282 per liter, thanks to a freight cost of $26.77 per MT (N8.31 per liter), according to finding from Platts.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like an opportunity for buying things at a cheaper price, it will be based on the international standard,\u201d Bello Rabiu, formerly the chief operating officer, Upstream at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), states.\n\nOther cost elements that make up the landing cost include lightering expenses (N4.81), Nigerian Ports Authority charge (N2.49), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency charge (N0.23), jetty throughput charge (N1.61), storage charge (N2.58), and financing (N2.17).\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, the pump price is the sum of the landing cost, wholesaler margin (N4.03), admin charge (N1.23), transporters allowance (N3.89), bridging fund (N7.51), marine transport average (N0.15), and retailer margin (N6.19).\n\n\u201cThe hope the Dangote Refinery brings is refreshing but relying on a single project to rescue the oil and gas sector of the world\u2019s 13th-largest crude producer points to the years of neglect that has riddled the sector and its damming frailty,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), says.\n\nOther experts are unanimous in their views that full deregulation would, in the long run, benefit ordinary Nigerians, and positively change the industry\u2019s fortunes forever if the government put the right structures in place.\n\n\u201cWithout full deregulation in Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector, we shouldn\u2019t expect any miracle,\u201d Nwakwue states.\n\nAt a recent foreign investors\u2019 meeting in New York, the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s import of petroleum products that accounted for 30 percent of its forex could be reversed by the successful commencement of operations at the Dangote Refinery.\n\nRead also: Dangote\u2019s giant Oil Refinery to Begin Production in Third Quarter of 2022\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery once it begins production would be a major FX saving source for Nigeria,\u201d the governor said, adding that \u201cif the 650,000\u201d daily barrels that will be produced from the refinery will \u201cbe sold in naira it would be a major FX saver for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, also thinks the Dangote Refinery will not solve all of Nigeria\u2019s problems in the downstream petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cDangote Refinery as a silver bullet to solving Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange problem is a misunderstanding of the facts. It will help in reducing refining cost, it will help in reducing transportation cost but it is the oil that you are going to export that will give you a dollar,\u201d Rewane said during a panel session at the IMF\u2019s Public Presentation of the fall 2021 Issue of the Regional Economic Outlook.\n\nThis is however not to say the huge refinery will not have any impact at all.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show if the Dangote Refinery operations go as announced, the refinery would add 0.6 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2022 with an estimate of 2.7 percent increase to 3.3 percent.\n\nFurther estimates show the refinery would add 2.2 percentage points to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2023, based on an estimate of 2.8 percent increase to 5.0 percent.\n\nThe criteria for these estimates are based on a conservative assumption that if the refinery starts in 2022 it will produce 10 percent of total capacity, 20 percent next year, and achieve full capacity after 2025.\n\nPundits believe the refinery should enable Nigeria to break free from the import of petroleum products and employ a large chunk of its unemployed youths. A piece of good news for the leading oil producer on the continent, which has faced several oil shortages.",
          "summary": "The current expectation is that the incoming Dangote Refinery will solve all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy woes, the government thinks, but findings by BusinessDay show otherwise.\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery will not solve the myriad of challenges bedevilling Nigeria\u2019s downstream sector such as lack of transparency, accountability, the domineering stature,\u201d he says.\nFor Adedipe, the Dangote Refinery is built on dollar-denominated loans, which means the project would focus more on speedily generating the dollars to services and repay those loans rather than selling cheap petrol.\n\u201cThe pump price of petrol from Dangote Refinery will reflect the market price of crude and cost of production, which will not be static at any point,\u201d Adedipe notes.\n\u201cDangote Refinery as a silver bullet to solving Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange problem is a misunderstanding of the facts.",

          "text": "The N3 trillion Africa\u2019s largest oil-producing country has committed to subsidising petrol in 2022 is no longer news, but what is more alarming is the opportunity cost forgone in a slow-growing economy that could use more investments.\n\nThe situation concerning the opaque petrol subsidy is having such a negative impact on the Nigerian economy, that despite global oil price topping $90 for the first time since 2014, every gain from oil exports is now almost entirely cancelled out by the costly subsidy regime.\n\nBusinessDay analysis reveals that the proposed subsidy spree of N3 trillion could have provided funds that would have been allocated to education, health, defence, and agriculture and rural development that would have increased the economic growth or standard of living of its over 200 million people.\n\nHealthcare\n\nFor instance, an analysis by BusinessDay shows the proposed subsidy spree of N3 trillion can fully equip 100,000 primary health centres across the country (at N30m each).\n\nThese would have improved access to health for the people and also created jobs for an average of 10 persons per health centre.\n\nHousing\n\nThe subsidy spree is capable of building at least 200,000 mortgage homes valued at N15 million each, a development that can play a big role in reducing Nigeria\u2019s housing deficit projected at 20 million.\n\nWater supply\n\nThe N3 trillion can construct at least 5 million boreholes at N600,000 each across the country. This could have reduced the challenges of proper sanitation faced by acute water scarcity in communities, especially in rural areas.\n\nStart-up capital\n\nAlso, close to 3 million entrepreneurs could have been empowered with an N1 million loan each to boost their businesses, a development that could culminate in job creation, increased GDP, and improved living standards for millions of Nigerians.\n\nSolar electricity\n\nThe subsidy spree is also capable of adding 27,342 megawatts (MW) of solar electricity to the national grid at N360 million per megawatt. This would have improved the power supply to the manufacturing industries, hence, enhancing production at a lower cost, which would have translated into low prices of goods.\n\nRead also: When is the right time to remove petroleum subsidy?\n\nEducation\n\nUsing Freedom of Information requests and analysis by transparency campaign group Public Private Development Centre, it would cost an estimated N17 million to build a 3-classroom block. This means N3 trillion is capable of building 176,470 blocks of classrooms needed across Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe subsidy spree is also capable of providing educational support through the tertiary level to 600,000 Nigerian children provided with educational support through the tertiary level at N5 million each.\n\nAgric machinery\n\nN3 trillion can also purchase an estimated 300,000 agricultural incubators used for the artificial hatching of fertilised eggs. This could have increased the efficiency and productivity of Nigerian farmers on the farm leading to greater output.\n\nGood roads\n\nThe decision to allocate N3 trillion to petrol subsidy also means Nigeria may have lost an opportunity to construct 6,000km of roads across major highways at N500 million each.\n\nRefineries\n\nEmerald Energy Institute at the University of Port Harcourt estimated the construction cost of a 100,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery plant at $2 billion (N830bn). This means the unremitted N3 trillion could have helped the country construct at least three of such refineries, instead of importing light petroleum products estimated at $15 billion per annum.\n\nImmunisation\n\nThe expenditure on subsidy for petrol also dwarfs the government proposed 2022 spending of N45.19 billion allocated for immunisation against measles, whooping cough, and tetanus to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children, despite a United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report showing 4.3 million children in Nigeria still miss out on regular vaccinations every year.",

          "title": "THREAT TO 2023 ELECTIONS: THE DANGER OF SPONSORTING THUGS TO WIN OSUN 2022 ELECTION \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe illegal action of sponsoring thugs to win party congresses in Osun is a recipe for violence. Governor Oyetola is inducing violence in Osun APC by orchestrating thugs attack and manipulated the state APC congresses. The use of thugs in Osun APC by Governor Oyetola to conduct ward, local government and state congresses clearly shows the level of bad governance in Osun State. The illegality and the danger of sponsoring thugs to win Osun 2022 election poses a great threat to 2023 election in Nigeria. Every democratic system has to regulate the flow of money and use of thugs for political gains. Illegal thugs funding for Osun 2022 election presents certain problems to future elections in modern liberal and the emerging democracy in Nigeria. Sponsoring of thugs in Osun State fails to guarantee fairness and equality in the competition among candidates and political parties. The outcome of Osun 2022 election may not reflect the interest of the majority in Osun State, but the interest of the financier of the thugs. This will necessitates reactions in the form of violence, which characterized Nigerian political system in the post general election, postelection litigation, and postelection violence. It is important for me to emphasize that many democratic governments to continually strive toward reducing thugs and money in politics. The danger ahead of Osun 2022 election is that Governor Oyetola used thugs to conduct APC state congress and he is set to use thugs against other political parties that will participate in the Osun 2022 election. Governor Oyetola is now a threat to members of Osun APC and a threat to Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections because he is not committed to free and fair election.\n\nI want to urge Governor Oyetola to concentrate on winning elections by the performance of his party and not by relying on thugs and violence for electoral victory. Good governance remains the surest path towards winning elections especially when you are committed to free and fair and credible elections devoid of the kind of violence witnessed in Osun State today. So instead of trying to pacify by violent and lawlessness just because Oyetola wants to win election, Oyetola should support the stellar performance being displayed by former Governor Aregbesola in Osun State, that way, he will not need the services of his thugs to win Osun 2022 election.\n\nGovrnor Oyetola has been sending thugs to attack members of Osun APC since 2021 so as to disrupt members of Osun APC meetings and prevent them from getting justice. Governor Oyetola is so sad that he will not be able to win Osun 2022 governorship election because of his bad governance. If Oyetola can rely on thugs to win APC PRIMARY, I wonder what will happen to Oyetola during July election. We are now seeing desperation and frustration in the behaviour of Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe attack on the Oranmiyan House, the political edifice of the immediate past governor and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola will not help Governor Oyetola to win Osun 2022 election. Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and some leaders of the faction supported by the governor are sponsoring attacks against Aregbesola\u2019s supporters. Governor Oyetola is pursuing victory without peace in Osun State because he lacks the experience of a leader and he is still behaving as if he is still working in an insurance company. These attacks are sponsored by the state government through the campaign structure of the governor, known as Ilerioluwa.\n\nThe hoodlums that attacking members of Osun APC were identified for the police in the state, but they were yet to make any arrest. I want to call on the Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali Baba to act swiftly on these attacks.\n\nThugs working for Governor Oyetola have denied members of Osun APC from conducting ward congress and state congress in 2021. Thugs seized their voting credentials and beat them up to produce Famodun as state chairman. The inability to conduct a free and fair state congress in Osun is a reflection of what Governor Oyetola stood for in Osun. The 2,517 aggrieved members of Osun APC have gone to court. It is not Aregbesola\u2019s camp that has gone to court. They are card-carrying members of Osun APC. They are pursuing their rights. I want to correct the wrong impression about labelling aggrieved members as Aregbesola\u2019s camp. Aggrieved members have the rights to go to court. The implication of 2,517 aggrieved members of APC court suit is that Governor Oyetola has lost his popularity and now relies on thugs to conduct ordinary party congress in Osun State. Thugs cannot save Governor Oyetola from defeat in Osun 2022 election. I want to warn that 2,517 aggrieved members should not be reduced to Aregbesola\u2019s name.\n\nAggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State that dragged the leadership of the party to court to challenge the outcome of the last state congress in the state will go to court of appeal to challenge the judgment. A total of 2,517 aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 26 local governments of the State of Osun have approached a Federal High Court, sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, to challenge the Ward Congress of the party, held on July 31, 2021 in the state. They are being victimised by political operatives in Osun loyal to Oyetola.\n\nGovernor Oyetola failed when he refused to submit Aregbesola\u2019s name for ministerial appointment but he was disappointed when Aregbesola was appointed as minister. Governor Oyetola failed when he used thugs to conduct Osun APC ward congress and now he is confused whether to revoke the certificate of occupancy of Oraminyan House in Osogbo. Governor Oyetola has resorted to the use of arrest and judicial harassment of political opponents since he is no longer popular in Osun. In March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs.\n\nThe popular Oranmiyan House belonging to the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Ar\u00e9gb\u00e9sol\u00e1 has constantly come under attack because it the venue of the weekly stakeholders meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP) .\n\nBystanders who watched the siege from a far how thugs armed with guns and other dangerous weapon unleashed terror on Oranmiyan House couldn\u2019t hold their tears as information has it that the floor targeted by the gun men was proposed to house TOP hierarchies meeting which was billed to hold immediately after the Thursday general meeting. Armed political hoodlums have been sponsored by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC), are currently attacking Oranmiyan House in Osogbo.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

But we still have about 40 countries that are yet to be launched officially. In the coming years, all these countries will be inaugurated officially.\n\n\u201cOur message is that of hope and to encourage our sons and daughter that no place like home, here in Nigeria we help them to protect their interest and ensure that they are not defrauded or victimized on any ground.\u201d\n\nAdams, the Global Convener of OPU, said the intention was to encourage business opportunities and also project the ideas of Yoruba cultural promotion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThrough our initiative, many, who have lost interest in coming back home because of the security situation in the country, are beginning to change their mind. The idea behind OPU is to improve the socio-economic prospects of all Yoruba sons and daughters abroad.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the idea behind the book which was unveiled in the presence of traditional leaders across different parts of the South-West, he said they intend to set the record straight and to rid the organisation of unnecessary misinterpretations.\n\nCorroborating his views, Chairman Planning Committee and European Coordinator of OPU, Chief Victor Adewale, who led delegates of Yoruba sons and daughters across six continents of the world, said that they are happy to be back home.\n\nAdewale said: \u201cPart of the programmes organized for this anniversary was our visit to the motherless and old people\u2019s home, where we gave a little of our kind gifts for their upkeeps. Also for OPU 10th anniversary, we embarked on various empowerments programmes for the widows and underprivileged people across the South-West.\u201d",

But for us in NIMC, the TOKENIZATION is available for the verification of the NIN before rendering services.\u201d\n\n\u2018Temporarily Unavailable\u2019\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the NIMC had confirmed the problem, which it attributed to ongoing maintenance.\n\n\u201cThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) wishes to inform the general public that its NIN verification Service (NVS) is temporarily unavailable due to the maintenance service being carried out by one of the Commission\u2019s network service providers,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe NIMC wants to assure the public that verification and authentication services would be restored once the maintenance is concluded.\n\n\u201cThe Commission apologises for any inconvenience this might cause our esteemed customers, as all hands are on deck to ensure speedy restoration.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the public can make use of the alternative Tokenisation verification platform.\u201d\n\n\u2018Loss of trust\u2019\n\nThe affected NIMC portal allows third parties to confirm the identity of customers.\n\nApart from telecoms firms, financial institutions and government agencies also rely on the service.\n\n\u201cThe biggest implication is the loss of trust,\u201d said technology analyst Fred Agbata. \u201cPeople who depend on things manually are told technology is a better option, but then downtimes can make their lives more miserable.\u201d\n\nAgbata also noted that the NVS downtime should lead to questions about how safe the system is in protecting the information of millions of Nigerians.\n\nLast month a hacker identified as Sam claimed he had found a bug on the NIMC server that could be used to breach the system.\n\nThe NIMC at the time debunked the hacker\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cOver the years, through painstaking efforts, NIMC has built a robust and credible system for Nigeria\u2019s identity database,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nNIN-SIM linkage\n\nThe linkage of NINs and SIMs was mandated by the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, as part of efforts to build a cohesive national database.\n\nAlthough the process was hampered by long queues and massive crowds amid COVID-19 restrictions, forcing the government to serially extend the deadline for the linkage, the NIMC has said it is committed to its mandate to establish, own, operate, maintain and manage the nation\u2019s identity database.\n\nAll other forms of identity management, including the Bank Verification Number (BVN), are expected to be linked to the NIN.",

          "text": "The United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has lamented over the rising cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the international agency, Nigeria accounts for the third-highest global number of FGM with a \u2018worrying trend\u2019 which has risen from 16.9 percent in 2013 to 19.2 percent.\n\nUNICEF Representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins said this in a statement released on Sunday in commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance of FGM.\n\n\u201cFemale genital mutilation (FGM) remains widespread in Nigeria. With an estimated 19.9 million survivors, Nigeria accounts for the third-highest number of women and girls who have undergone FGM worldwide.\n\n\u201cWhile the national prevalence of FGM among women in Nigeria aged 15-49 dropped from 25 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2018 it increased from 16.9 percent to 19.2 percent in the same period,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Governors\u2019 Wives Forum Backs NDLEA, Seeks Partnership On Drug War\n\nHe stressed that the case is prevalent among Nigerian girls aged 0-14 and an estimated 86 percent of females were cut before the age of 5, while 8 percent were cut between ages 5 and 14.\n\nHawkins added that millions of girls are being robbed of their childhoods, health, education, and aspirations every day by harmful practices such as FGM.\n\n\u201cThe practice of FGM not only has no health benefits \u2013 it is deeply harmful to girls and women, both physically and psychologically. It is a practice that has no place in our society today and must be ended, as many Nigerian communities have already pledged to do.\u201d\n\nHe further explained, \u201cState prevalence ranges from 62 percent in Imo to less than 1 percent in Adamawa and Gombe. The prevalence of FGM is highest in the South East (35 percent) and South West (30 percent) and lowest in the North East (6 percent).\u201d\n\nTo end the menace, he said, \u201cUNICEF is initiating a community-led movement to eliminate FGM in five Nigerian states where it is highly prevalent: Ebonyi, Ekiti, Imo, Osun and Oyo.\n\nAccording to him, nearly three million girls and women would have undergone FGM in these states in the last five years.\n\nThe UNICEF in response to the alarming rate of FGM cases in Nigeria has created a movement called \u2013 \u201cThe Movement for Good.\u201d It is aimed to reach five million adolescent girls and boys, women \u2013 including especially pregnant and lactating mothers \u2013 men, grandparents, and traditional, community and religious leaders, legislators, justice sector actors, and state officials through an online pledge to \u2018say no\u2019 to FGM.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is a form of violence against women. It is a human rights abuse.\n\nIt leaves scars that last a lifetime.\n\nLet\u2019s protect our girls and #endFGM! pic.twitter.com/qYfAONY4I1 \u2014 UN Women (@UN_Women) February 6, 2022\n\nHawkins said the movement will mobilize affected communities for concrete action at the household level to protect girls at risk of FGM.\n\nIt will challenge misconceptions on FGM and the discriminatory reasons it is practiced and break the silence around the practice together with communities.\n\nThe International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM is celebrated to accelerate efforts \u2013 especially with families and communities \u2013 to achieve a Nigeria safe for girls and women and finally free of FGM.",

          "title": "Nigeria Faults Financial Times Report on Insecurity, Says Nowhere Controlled By Terrorists",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Presidency on Sunday faulted a report on security challenges in the country, published in the January 31, 2022 edition of Financial Times of London Newspaper, saying banditry has been caged to the level that no territory in the country was under terrorists control.\n\nIn another breath, the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), said at the weekend that the federal government was committed to providing more platforms for the military to sustain the tempo of operations in order to contain insurgency, banditry and other security challenges across the country.\n\nHowever, in a letter to the Editor, Financial Times, by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, the Presidency expressed its concern over the wrong perceptions contained in the article: \u201cWhat is Nigeria\u2019s Government For,\u201d authored by David Piling.\n\nAccording to the one-page letter, the presidency stated: \u201cThe caricature of a government sleepwalking into disaster (What is Nigeria\u2019s government for? January 31, 2022 ) is predictable from a correspondent, who jets briefly in and out of Nigeria on the same British Airways flight he so criticises.\n\n\u201cHe highlights rising banditry in my country as proof of such slumber.\n\n\u2018What he leaves out are the security gains made over two presidential terms. The terror organisation Boko Haram used to administer an area the size of Belgium at inauguration; now, they control no territory.\n\n\u201cThe first comprehensive plan to deal with decades-old clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers \u2013 experienced across the width of the Sahel \u2013 has been introduced: pilot ranches are reducing the competition for water and land that drove past tensions.\n\n\u201cBanditry grew out of such clashes. Criminal gangs took advantage of the instability, flush with guns that flooded the region following the Western-triggered implosion of Libya. The situation is grave. Yet as with other challenges, it is one that the government will face down.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Magashi, speaking at the end of the 2021 West African Social Activities (WASA) of the Army Headquarters Garrison, in Abuja, said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s continuous support for the armed forces added impetus to the ongoing efforts by the Nigerian armed forces in the fight against insurgency.\n\n\u201cIt is based on the support of the federal government that the ministry had continued to strive relentlessly to keep the services by providing various grades of equipment and ammunition. We shall continue to make efforts to ensure that more platforms are prescribed to sustain the tempo of operations.\n\n\u201cI wish to state that you must imbibe good maintenance culture so as to make this equipment readily available, when needed for operations. It is worthy to mention that training is the best welfare that can be given to officers and soldiers and I am very appreciative of the efforts of the Chief of Army Staff for ensuring that all the training exercises for the year 2021, were successfully conducted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said the conduct of the training for the military had proven to be result-oriented, adding that several personnel, who were trained and deployed for operations had performed creditably well.\n\nHe reassured the Nigerian army that the ministry would continue to accord the welfare of officers and soldiers and their family a priority.\n\nMagashi also commended the officers and soldiers for their sacrifices towards ensuring enduring peace in the country, adding that 2021 was an eventful year characterised by challenges, sober moments and records of successes.\n\nHe recalled the gallant performance and sacrifices of the Nigerian army personnel in counterterrorism, counter insurgency and other operations across the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander, Army Headquarters Garrison, Maj. Gen. Sanusi Dahiru, said WASA was an enduring tradition of the Nigerian army, during which officers, soldiers and their families come together to socialise in a relaxed mood.\n\nDahiru said the event also served as a vehicle to enhance esprit de corps and the spirit of brotherliness within a command and avenue to appreciate personnel for their individual and collective contributions towards the success of the command.\n\nHe said the command diligently provided operational, administrative and logistic support to the army headquarters departments, formations and units, as well as successfully executing all training activities.\n\nHe appreciated the chief of army staff for exemplary leadership, passionate and selfless commitment to the welfare of personnel, assuring them that the garrison would do its best to sustain the tempo of achievements in 2022.\n\n\u201cI wish to state that the personnel of the command are poised to carry out the activities with renewed vigor and commitment in terms of professionalism, responsiveness and commitment in the discharge of the constitutional duties,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event featured cultural display by different ethnic groups and a tug of war, which featured the female members of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) serving in the garrison.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Five days after a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility belonging to Shebah Exploration and Production Company Limited (SEPCOL) exploded in Warri, the company on Sunday announced that three crew members aboard the ship had been found alive.\n\nA statement by the company signed by its Chief Executive Officer, Ikemefuna Okafor, indicated that one unidentified body was also noticed floating around the vessel, Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field (OML 108).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe can confirm that three crew members have been found alive in the community and our priority is to ensure that they receive the appropriate medical attention they need.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the early hours of Sunday, 6th February 2022, one dead body was discovered in the vicinity of the FPSO. The identity of the dead body is yet to be ascertained.\u201d\n\nAn earlier update provided on Saturday by the company had confirmed that the fire had been extinguished, while the search for whereabouts of the crew on board was ongoing.\n\nThe incident on the FPSO, with a capacity to process up to 22,000 barrels of oil per day, inject up to 40,000 barrels of water per day and store two million barrels of oil, took place around Excravos, Warri South-west, Delta State.\n\nTrinity Spirit is the primary production facility for OML 108, which covers 750 square km (290 square miles) of water off the Niger Delta, ranging from a depth of 30 metres to 213 metres, according to SEPCOL\u2019s website.\n\nTHISDAY checks showed that the huge facility was built in 1976 (46 years ago), with a carrying capacity of 274774 Dead Weight Tonnage (DWT). SEPCOL, now in receivership, in 2004 acquired all 40 per cent of ConocoPhillips equity interest in OML 108 owned by a combination of Nigerian and overseas corporate entities, which include Abbeycourt Trading Company Limited (ATCO), Abbeycourt Petroleum Company Limited, and Allenne Limited.\n\nThe FPSO serves as the primary production facility for OML 108 and it is also a government approved terminal for lifting operations for all the facility\u2019s production.\n\nAt the time the massive fire erupted on-board the vessel, it was learnt that about 10 persons were within the facility, but with three crew members found, at least seven of the persons on board were yet to be accounted for on Sunday. In the statement, SEPCOL reiterated that the fire burnt out completely as of last Thursday, thus enabling closer inspection of the vessel.\n\nA Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) with the relevant authorities, stakeholders, and expert organisations, it said, took place on Saturday, 5th February 2022.\n\n\u201cThe focus of our joint efforts is to prioritise investigations towards establishing the whereabouts, safety, and security of the seven crew members still missing, clean up and limit damage to the environment, and establish the cause of the explosion,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe company appreciated the assistance provided by the Clean Nigeria Associates, the Chevron team, other stakeholders and people in the community, particularly the fishermen, who it said had been of immense help since the incident occurred.\n\nFurthermore, the management of SEPCOL urged members of the public to continue to keep away from the area while its crisis management team monitored developments in the investigations and updated stakeholders with new information accordingly.\n\nAlthough the details were yet to be made public, The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders had also embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility.\n\nNUPRC said, \u201cThe commission will further deploy its incident management strategy while also ensuring that the removal of the FPSO is carried out professionally to prevent an escalation of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe commission will continue to ensure that all safety and environmental measures are strictly adhered to in the management of the incident.\u201d\n\nFPSO serves as the primary production facility of for OML 108 and it is also a government approved terminal for lifting operations for all the asset\u2019s production.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters quoted the Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, as saying at the weekend that the oil storage vessel was holding around 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of crude oil at the time of the incident. Ikeazor said the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) had called the oil industry operators and the Clean Nigeria Associates, a cooperative responding to oil spill incidents, for support.\n\nIt also quoted Chairman of the host fishing community, Ikusemuya Igbekele, as disclosing that two bodies were seen lying dead in front of the vessel, while three crew members jumped into the sea with life jackets and had been taken to the hospital.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",

          "title": "Nigeria VP Osinbajo to Announce Presidential Bid after February 26 APC Convention",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has concluded plans to announce his presidential ambition immediately after the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nSources close to Osinbajo\u2019s strategy team hinted at the weekend that in spite of the ongoing campaigns against his currently rumoured bid for the presidency by some interests in the South-west, where he hails from, Osinbajo had made up his mind to give the presidency a shot.\n\nEven more instructive, inside sources claimed, was the fact that Osinbajo had received the blessing and the charge to go ahead with his ambition from his spiritual father and General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye.\n\nThe source said, \u201cTake it to the bank, he will run and he is declaring soon after the APC convention. All is set, including premium consultations already done. The coast is clear and the journey is looking good. I believe prof is also motivated by the increasing level of support from across the country, especially, the youths of this country.\n\n\u201cFrom the north to the south, tell me where he has visited recently and the charge has not been that he should contest? He has capacity, competence and knows what the issues are. Importantly, he can also sell them \u2013 I mean the issues. So, why will he not run? Why should the bitterness and envy of some minions stifle him?\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, who sources said was unfazed by the growing allegation of betrayal and the push for him to stand down his ambition for his former principal and supposed benefactor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had since declared his intention to run, was said to have described the attacks against him as the real motivation to take his chances.\n\nThe source added, \u201cIn fact, none of such bothers him. But he has done one thing though, he has called his supporters and pleaded with them never to talk down on Tinubu or engage in a mud fight with his support groups, even in the face of obvious provocation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Osinbajo has refused to officially talk about his aspiration, despite the growing support for him to succeed Buhari, he is said to have been holding high level consultations with prominent Nigerians, many of whom have encouraged him to give the aspiration his best shot possible.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Osinbajo\u2019s motivation to run for the presidency in 2023 stemmed from the first time he acted as president, when Buhari was away on medical leave to London, during which he took far-reaching decisions in the national interest. It was further gathered that taking active charge during the period provided the vice president both the confidence and impetus to desire to succeed his current boss.\n\nAn APC member, who is favourably disposed to Osinbajo\u2019s aspiration, stated, \u201cIt may be right to admit he stands a really good chance to succeed President Buhari after eight years as his deputy. He is an insider, who has had the opportunity of seeing things from high and serious vantage position, especially, having acted before on behalf of his boss.\n\n\u201cAlthough that may not be enough to get the presidency of Nigeria, because I believe and I know there are some politics directly connected to being the president of Nigeria. But, how well Osinbajo fits into that conversation is another debate altogether. From the list of those currently strutting the turf, he stands a really good chance, except the election is not his to lose.\n\n\u201cBut, file this away, he is contesting and would declare after the APC convention. I am aware of that. There\u2019s actually no stopping him. The supports have been sweeping and encouraging and for him, this opportunity might just be once and might never come his way again. Sincerely, he has nothing to lose throwing his hat in the ring. After all, he is already a frontline aspirant.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was true that Adeboye had given his blessing, the party chieftain, who would rather maintain anonymity, stated, \u201cI am not privy to that, but it\u2019s also a simple logic. Osinbajo is a pastor in Redeem and Baba Adeboye would never leave one of his own to support someone else. I also believe he must have hinted him. Honestly, the days ahead will be interesting.\u201d\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Fitch: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector Weak Performance May Slowdown Economic Growth",
          "text": "Fitch Solutions, an affiliate of global rating agency, Fitch, has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s weak performance in the oil and gas sector may continue to slow down the country\u2019s economy in the coming years. In its latest report on the state of the Nigerian economy, the rating agency stated that from its analysis, the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) might not markedly impact the country in the near term.\n\nForecasting an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent in the next four years, the group added that given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, it expected that average incomes would continue to stagnate in the country.\n\nFitch stated, \u201cWhile the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was finally signed in 2021, will create a more stable operating environment, we doubt that it will have a significant effect on investment this year. It will take time for foreign firms to launch any new projects.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite the new bill, our oil and gas team expects that oil production will gradually fall over the coming years. We predict an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent between 2023 and 2026. All told, fixed investment spending will contribute just 0.6 per cent to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report projected that the poor performance of the oil sector, which is Nigeria\u2019s key foreign exchange earner, would keep headline growth weak over the coming years.\n\nThe rating agency said, \u201cWe expect that real GDP growth will average just 2.9 per cent between 2023 and 2026. Headline growth will be even weaker in per capita terms. Given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, we expect that average incomes will continue to stagnate.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the slowdowns, Fitch predicted that economic growth in Nigeria would pick up slightly from an estimated 3.1 per cent in 2021, to 3.5 per cent in 2022, primarily driven by increased oil production, which will boost export growth. But the firm stated that it expected that growth would slow to 2.9 per cent in 2023, and over the medium term, that the combination of poor economic performance and rapid population growth per capita income would essentially stagnate.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe at Fitch Solutions expect Nigeria\u2019s economy will expand by 3.5 per cent in 2022. This would be the eighth consecutive year in which Nigeria has underperformed the aggregate growth figure for Emerging Markets (EM). We expect growth of 4.8 per cent across EMs as a whole.\n\n\u201cEven so, 3.5 per cent growth would represent an acceleration compared to the 3.1 per cent growth for 2021, and be Nigeria\u2019s best performance since 2014.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fitch solutions predicted that the volume of Nigeria\u2019s oil production would rise by 4.1 per cent in 2022, which would be a significant improvement compared to 2021, when it estimated that output fell by 8.1 per cent as a result of low investment and OPEC+ cuts.\n\nThe report said, \u201cBut with the OPEC+ agreement now ending, we think that output will rise, though it will remain below the recent peak recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cSince oil makes up almost 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s exports, increased production will boost the country\u2019s export earnings. Indeed, given rising agricultural exports, we expect that exports will rise by 11.6 per cent in real terms in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhereas net exports subtracted 1.0 percentage points (pps) from headline growth in 2021, we think that the component will add 1.8pps to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, the slow but rising oil production would also fuel strong private consumption growth, spurring private consumption spending to rise by 3.5 per cent in 2022, in line with the outturn in 2021.\n\nThe report explained, \u201cThis will contribute 2.2pps to headline growth. Continued FX shortages and slow productivity growth in the agricultural sector \u2013 which employs almost 35.0 per cent of the workforce \u2013 will prevent a sharper acceleration. Indeed, over the past seven years, private consumption growth has averaged just 0.7 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe expect that government consumption will rise by 3.0 per cent in 2022. The government passed an ambitious budget in late 2021, but recent experience suggests that implementation will be very weak.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, sceptical about plans to significantly increase public infrastructure spending. Indeed, some projects were probably included in the budget for political reasons before the 2023 election, and we expect that very little real progress will be made. Given the small scale of Nigeria\u2019s federal government, public spending will contribute just 0.4pp to headline growth.\u201d\n\nIt emphasised that the government\u2019s failure to raise living standards would probably result in increased social tensions over the coming years, projecting that the febrile political environment can result in violence surrounding presidential elections scheduled for 2023.\n\n\u201cOur current forecasts assume that the vote passes peacefully, but a series of violent clashes \u2013 as happened in 2011 \u2013 could pose a headwind to real GDP growth,\u201d it projected.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "Fitch Solutions, an affiliate of global rating agency, Fitch, has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s weak performance in the oil and gas sector may continue to slow down the country\u2019s economy in the coming years.\n\u201cIndeed, despite the new bill, our oil and gas team expects that oil production will gradually fall over the coming years.\nAll told, fixed investment spending will contribute just 0.6 per cent to headline growth in 2022.\u201dThe report projected that the poor performance of the oil sector, which is Nigeria\u2019s key foreign exchange earner, would keep headline growth weak over the coming years.\nHeadline growth will be even weaker in per capita terms.\nIt said, \u201cWe at Fitch Solutions expect Nigeria\u2019s economy will expand by 3.5 per cent in 2022.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Amended Electoral Bill Bars Ministers, Commissioners from Contesting in Primaries",
          "text": "Should President Muhammadu Buhari sign the new Electoral Act amendment bill recently forwarded to him by the National Assembly into law, all political appointees in his government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nThe implication is that some key ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, said to be nursing presidential ambitions would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties.\n\nWhat this therefore, means is that ministers, commissioners and other political appointees are expected to resign ahead of their parties\u2019 primaries in order to be eligible to contest in the primaries.\n\nTop on the list of the aspiring appointees to be affected by this new amendment are the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. They are believed to have presidential ambitions, even though they have yet to declare their interests.\n\nBut by the provision at issue, political appointees are also barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace is no longer available.\n\nHowever, with the new amendment, if signed by the President, they would henceforth be required to vacate office completely before being eligible to contest.\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nBut there appears to be a lacuna in the new law, which may encourage infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources believe the clause is meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often control those who become automatic delegates and determine the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d refrain of the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many is that, with a clause that clearly breaches the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again. If this happens, a new electoral law may not be ready for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Assembly had recently transmitted the new Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill to Buhari for assent, through the Clerk of the National Assembly, Olatunde Ojo. Before the latest transmission, Buhari had in December 2021, vetoed the former amendment bill, leading to a recommittal by the National Assembly.\n\nThere have been misgivings about the new amendment, fuelling speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law. The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThe harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature was considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives on the amendment to Clause 84 of the bill.\n\nIn this clause, the direct, indirect and consensus modes of primary election by political parties were included. This was after the controversy that trailed the different versions initially approved by the two chambers.\n\nThe senate had in its re-amended bill approved direct, indirect, and consensus primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, while the House only provided direct and indirect modes, saying the president did not speak about the consensus option, when he vetoed the previous bill.\n\nBut President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, while presiding at plenary, stated that both chambers had agreed to give a clear and sufficient definition for each mode of primary, and how they would be conducted.\n\nLawan explained that for the consensus method, the two chambers produced a clear-cut definition on how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
