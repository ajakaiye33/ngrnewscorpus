          "text": "The suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, currently standing trial for alleged drug trafficking on Thursday asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to release him on bail over alleged threat to his life.\n\nKyari, through his team of lawyers led by Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN, told the court that he is feeling unsafe at the Kuje Correctional Centre where, he said, he was being remanded with hardened criminals.\n\nIkpeazu said the fresh application for the court to reconsider the request his client earlier made for bail pending the determination of the charge against him became necessary, considering the nature of assignments he undertook while performing his duties as a police officer.\n\nAccording to him, some of the inmates at the correctional centre are people that Kyari\u2019s Police Intelligence Response Team arrested.\n\nAside from Kyari, three other police officers that are also on trial over the alleged offence- ACP Sunday J. Ubia, Inspector Simon Agirigba and Inspector John Nuhu- also begged the court to release them on bail on safety grounds.\n\nHowever, the third defendant in the matter, Bawa James, who is an Assistant Superintendent of Police, did not join them in the application.\n\nLawyer for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Sunday Joseph, asked the court to reject the bail request.\n\nThe prosecution counsel maintained that the matter was originally slated for the review of facts of the case relating to two self-confessed drug traffickers, Chibunna Umeibe and Emeka Ezenwane, who were linked to Kyari.\n\nBoth Umeibe and Ezenwanne, who were cited as sixth and seventh defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu while attempting to smuggle cocaine into the country.\n\nThey had on March 7, when they were arraigned alongside Kyari, pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charge.\n\nKyari, who pleaded not guilty to the charge against him, had contended that reviewing facts of the case or sentencing Umeibe and Ezenwanne, while his trial is still ongoing, would be prejudicial to him.\n\nHe also drew attention of the court to the fact that both Umeibe and Ezenwanne were also mentioned in some counts in the charge that involved him and the other accused police officers.\n\nThe court had in a ruling it delivered on April 28, dismissed Kyari\u2019s objections and held that it would go ahead to review facts of the case against Umeibe and Ezenwanne.\n\nNevertheless, at the resumed proceedings on the matter on Thursday, Kyari and his police co-defendants said they have gone to the Court of Appeal to challenge the ruling.\n\nThey further filed a motion for the court to temporarily halt the trial to await the outcome of the appeal, an application that was opposed by the prosecution which accused the defendants of attempting to stay proceeding in a criminal matter.\n\nJustice Emeka Nwite adjourned the case till June 14 to hear the defendants\u2019 fresh application for bail.\n\nThe NDLEA had alleged that Kyari and his men, unlawfully tampered with 21.25kilograms worth of cocaine that they seized from the two apprehended drug traffickers, even as it also accused them of dealing in cocaine worth 17.55kg.\n\nIt alleged that the police officers committed the offence between January 19 and 25, 2022, at the office of Inspector-General of Police IRT, Abuja, in connivance with one ASP John Umoru (now at large), contrary to section 14(b) of the NDLEA Act, CAP N30 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nBesides, Kyari was said to have attempted to bribe a senior officer of the NDLEA with $61, 400 at a restaurant in Abuja to prevent the testing of part of the cocaine that was seized from the two arrested drug pushers..\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He simply said in a text message: \u201cThat will be a great news.\u201d\n\nHowever, he told The Nation that the party had been talking to several aggrieved politicians from the other parties, with a view to having them cross over to the NNPP, but he ruled out automatic ticket for anybody.\n\nHe said those to be offered the party\u2019s ticket must be ready to play by the rules of the party, adding that offering automatic ticket to anybody would go against the guidelines put in place by the party for its primaries.\n\nAlkali said: \u201cThe truth is that, if you talk of automatic ticket for anybody, that will amount to subverting our guidelines for the primaries, our own constitution and even the Nigerian constitution.\n\n\u201cElection is supposed to be open to everybody, both old members of the party and new comers. But whoever comes in, as long as the sale of form has not been closed, he is at liberty to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms. He will not be excluded, but may require a waiver from the party.\n\n\u201cThe rule is that whenever you join a political party, even though you are accepted as a member of the party, you will require a waiver to show that the party has finally accepted you as a member to stand for election.\n\n\u201cBut the issue of automatic ticket does not arise because other members of the party are going to fight him. There are people who will fee aggrieved that you are giving automatic ticket to some people. He should subject himself to primaries and if he is popular, he will emerge.\u201d\n\nWhile confirming that discussions are ongoing to attract other big politicians to the party, he said: \u201cWe are talking to those who have not been treated fairly in other parties. We look for them and reach out to them because this is a Nigerian project.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about the future of our country. So, anybody who comes and embraces our core mission and values is welcome because we are going to do things differently from how they have been done in other parties.\n\n\u201cBut the person must understand that when you come, you must also be guided by our own rules, our constitution and our code of conduct because that is the only way we can ensure that we are different from others.

Stella Oduah was mobilised for youth service in 1982 and served in the Lagos orientation camp, but then concluded that she \u2018absconded\u2019 and was not issued a certificate of discharge,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThat reckless statement, which we consider grossly irresponsible, no doubt suggests that it was procured from you for political considerations in favour of Sen. Oduah\u2019s political detractors. We are shocked that you condescended so low to make such false and unverified conclusions, which is damaging to her character and image.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Oduah\u2019s NYSC place of primary assignment was the popular Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA). When a similar allegation was made by her political contenders in 2017, NECA issued a letter dated 11th January 2017 Ref No: NECA/SELA/H4 confirming that she carried out her NYSC primary assignment with them. Find attached a copy of that letter for reference as well as a photograph of our client as a youth corper.\n\n\u201cThat issue also attended litigation and she has a court judgment in her favour in the case of Chinedu Emmanuel Emeka v. Princess Stella Oduah, EPT/AWK/SEN/13/2019.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, one needs not be bothered about any other similar allegations in the light of the aforesaid judgment and the fact that NYSC is not a constitutional qualification to hold any public office in Nigeria, but your statement has to a large extent defamed her.\n\n\u201cIn your exact words, \u2018after the orientation course, she absconded\u2019. It is curious how a person who had participated in all NYSC activities at the Orientation Camp can be said to have \u201cabsconded\u201d because she left for her place of primary assignment as it was the routine. It is either you chose to ignore your record or your office has failed to keep proper records.\n\n\u201cYou are by this letter given 48 hours to retract your statement, failing which legal actions shall be commenced against you.\u201d",

The aspirants, according to sources, could not reach agreement on the delegates\u2019 list, which many of them had not seen prior to the meeting. It was reported further that the list was not handed over to any of the aspirants, but the front page of it was only shown to the stakeholders afar off.\n\nOne of the aspirants, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), as gathered, requested for the list so that he and other aspirants could know those that are in the delegates\u2019 list, which was purportedly rejected by the committee. It was there he said openly that he would pull out of the primary if he was not allowed to see the list. He later addressed a press conference in Ibadan, where he announced officially that he has pulled out of the primary, describing it as a charade.\n\nThe five governorship aspirants, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, Senator Teslim Folarin, Dr. Azeez Adeduntan, Akeem Agbaje, and Alao Oyedele, also left the venue with their supporters.

Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can\u2019t guarantee him as a consensus candidate\n\n\u201cAt that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,\u201d another source had said.\n\nSaharaReporters broke the story of how a cabal in the ruling APC had pushed for Jonathan to succeed Buhari, after being impressed by how the former President never openly criticised Buhari government despite its ineptitude and the insults the APC, as an opposition party, hurled at him (Jonathan) ahead of the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe fact that Jonathan cannot spend more than one term in office, if they can manage to get him there, is also not lost on the cabal. However, SaharaReporters has also reported how Jonathan was later called a betrayer by the cabal after he failed to fulfil some of the conditions given to him, including convincing some PDP governors to defect to the APC.\n\nFollowing speculations that Jonathan was preparing to defect to the ruling APC and seek the presidential ticket of the party, some Nigerians, including human rights lawyer Femi Falana (SAN), argued that his candidature will breach the constitution. Other Nigerians have also expressed different opinions on the issue.\n\nFalana had based his position on Section 137 (3) of the Constitution, which provides as follows: \u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\u201d\n\nFalana had said, \u201cSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr Jonathan. Assuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years. In Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of 4 years and if a second term, another period of 4 years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Governor Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment. The Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a Governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of four years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d",

I understand tomorrow (Friday) is the day for that judgement from the Federal High Court in Yenagoa declaring Goodluck Jonathan is eligible to contest.\n\n\u201cThey are tying up their loose ends,\u201d a source privy to the case told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\nFollowing speculations that he was preparing to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and seek the presidential ticket of the party, some Nigerians, including human rights lawyer Femi Falana, argued that his candidature will breach the constitution. But other Nigerians have also expressed different opinions on the issue.\n\nFalana had based his position on Section 137 (3) of the Constitution, which provides as follows: \u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\u201d See Also Sahara Reporters Ex-Leader Jonathan Not Qualified To Run For President In 2023 Election\u2013 Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s Lawyer, Ejimakor Backs Falana\n\nFalana had said, \u201cSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr Jonathan. Assuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years. In Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of 4 years and if a second term, another period of 4 years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Governor Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment. The Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a Governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of four years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d\n\nJonathan had recently rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.\n\nSpeaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the forms without his permission.\n\nHowever, sources had told SaharaReporters that claims by the former President that he did not authorise the purchase of the multi-million-naira forms are far from the truth. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Jonathan Gave Jigawa Governor, Badaru Over N200Million, Sent Him To Buy APC Presidential Nomination Form To Deceive Nigerians\n\n\u201cContrary to his denials, former President Goodluck Jonathan gave over N200 million to the governor of Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru, to purchase the APC nomination and expression of interest forms for him,\u201d a source privy to the arrangement had told SaharaReporters.\n\nInterestingly, the Jigawa governor, Badaru had also joined other interested presidential aspirants to vie for the ticket of the APC by buying the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\n\u201cI will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job,\u201d Badaru was quoted as saying during an APC stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at Government House in Dutse recently.\n\nThe governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised by his colleagues to contest for the presidential seat.\n\nHis media aide, Auwalu Sankara, had said his principal had sought President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s blessings before buying the forms.\n\nBut SaharaReporters learnt that the Jigawa governor had bought the forms and come up with the statements as a ruse to deceive Nigerians; as he was indeed working for Jonathan.\n\nIt was further learnt that Jonathan had backed out of the plan and swiftly come up with the denial after the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had refused to guarantee that the former President would be the consensus candidate of the ruling party.\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s leader as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is now an opposition party.\n\n\u201cThe reason why he (Jonathan) gave him that much money \u2013 over N200 million \u2013 was that he asked the governor to buy himself a form too in order to cover up the deal,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\u201cAnd upon purchasing the form, Jonathan alerted Buhari. Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can\u2019t guarantee him as a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cAt that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,\u201d another source had said.\n\nSaharaReporters broke the story of how a cabal in the ruling APC had pushed for Jonathan to succeed Buhari, after being impressed by how the former President never openly criticised Buhari government despite its ineptitude and the insults the APC, as an opposition party, hurled at him (Jonathan) ahead of the 2015 presidential election. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Again, Aso Rock Cabal Asks Jonathan To Prepare For Ruling APC Presidential Ticket, Rejects Tinubu, Osinbajo\n\nThe fact that Jonathan cannot spend more than one term in office, if they can manage to get him there, is also not lost on the cabal. However, SaharaReporters has also reported how Jonathan was later called a betrayer by the cabal after he failed to fulfil some of the conditions given to him, including convincing some PDP governors to defect to the APC.",

          "text": "The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL), has called on Senator Stella Oduah to resign from the National Assembly if she cannot come clean from the allegation of perjury levelled against her.\n\nThe group, while it called for her immediate prosecution, asked the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, to immediately disqualify her from participating in the senatorial primary for Anambra State North District.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the lawmaker representing Anambra North Senatorial zone did not complete her National Youth Service.\n\nFollowing the report of SaharaReporters, CACOL, issued a statement on Thursday titled, \u201cNYSC Certificate Scandal: CACOL Calls for Resignation and immediate Prosecution Of Stella Oduah.\u201d\n\nIn the statement signed by Director of Administration and Programmes, Tola Oresanwo, on behalf of its Chairman, Debo Adeniran, CACOL said It was no longer news that Stella Oduah did not complete the mandatory NYSC as the leadership of the scheme had confirmed that she absconded from service.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIn a letter by the Director-General of the NYSC which was signed on his behalf by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, the agency said Oduah commenced her NYSC programme in 1982 but absconded. The letter was in response to an inquiry by a group known as the Concerned Anambra North PDP Stakeholders.\n\n\"It was reported that in her CF001 forms submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission in 2019, Oduah claimed that she completed her NYSC but her certificate was missing along with other credentials.\n\n\"An affidavit she deposed to read in part, \u201cSometime in 2010 while in transit from Akili Ozizor in Ogbaru local government area to Abuja, I discovered that some of my personal belongings were missing.\n\n\u201cThe missing documents are the originals of my West African School Certificate of 1978 from Zixon Secondary School Ozubulu, First School Leaving Certificate from St. John Odoakpu Onitsha; Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Certificate 1982 from St. Paul\u2019s College Lawrence Virginia USA; National Youth Service Corps certificate 1983, national identity card, United States of America Social Security card with numbers in it.\u201d\n\nThe group queried, \"If she absconded from service where on earth did she see the NYSC certificate she claimed and swore on oath that is missing? Did she print the certificate by herself? Did she lie on oath? This even to a layman is known as perjury.\n\n\u201cWhat should not be encouraged, under any guise, is a reign of impunity as the country steers towards consolidation of its democratic culture. This scandal in which Mrs Stella Oduah is currently enmeshed is another major, monumental and massive disgrace not only to the hallowed chamber of the Senate where she is currently representing her constituency but to the country at large.\n\n\u201cIt is saddening to note that it\u2019s fast becoming a norm for public office holders and representatives of the people to parade fake credentials and with brazen arrogance and confidence still go ahead to swear on oath with bogus credentials in their possession. Although, we know that a Federal High Court had already ruled that possessing an NYSC certificate was not a condition for holding public office but what happened in a situation whereby the person lied on oath.\n\n\u201cWe at CACOL hereby call on the leadership of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, headed by Senator Iyorchia Ayu, to immediately disqualify Oduah who has been screened to contest in the primary from contesting.\"\n\nIt added, \u201cWe also want to implore our election monitoring body, INEC, to intensify the process of screening political aspirants before they are cleared to contest elections. A joint and collaborative effort of all the security agencies would have helped to nip a national embarrassment like this in the bud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur current situation as a nation demands that public officers and representatives of the people should be seen to be above board and not people who are inclined to crime.\n\n\"It is in this regard that we, therefore, call on the lawmaker representing Anambra-North senatorial district, Stella Oduah to resign with immediate effect and we are also calling on the anti-graft agencies to start her prosecution without further delay,\" the group stated.",

I have seen all kinds of promotional media content, including articles by notable columnists, associating me with the 2023 presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet me reveal with apologies, that some close associates of key presidential aspirants have sent me offers for the position of running mate, as possible vice-president, depending on the outcome of the APC presidential primaries by the weekend.\n\n\u201cI have thought deeply about these offers because becoming vice-president is considered attractive. I have thought about all the powers and privileges of being VP. I can see the honour of presiding over meetings attended by governors and ministers, and the privilege of having a presidential jet at one\u2019s disposal. I can see the honour of presidential receptions within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, I have asked myself, that should I get the opportunity to become VP and raise my political profile, what happens to all our ongoing works for the people of Borno state?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have built more than 10,000 houses, and currently more of such and reconstructing existing ones, for ongoing resettlement of our people. We have resettled more than 20 communities so far. Yet, thousands of our fellow citizens are still homeless and in desperate need of food, water, and healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe have adopted a development plan that we are already implementing. I have asked myself, what happens to all these plans that I am central to, which are helping to fast-track our recovery in Borno state?\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the killings in Kala-Balge at the weekend made me more critical, and the incident seriously reminded me of the challenges that are still ahead of us in Borno state.\n\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that while a chance to become vice-president could benefit my profile as an individual, becoming reelected as governor of Borno state has the potential of more assurance of benefit to the good people of Borno state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI, therefore, say that while I thank those who may be considering me for the position of VP, I prefer to stay back and work drastically for the people of Borno state, because for me as a citizen of Borno state, working with others to hastily rebuild Borno state is the most urgent need and it is beyond any aspiration.\n\n\u201cI profoundly thank everyone who thought of me worthy of any responsibility and I pray that Allah helps us to work towards the full restoration of peace, the full recovery and growth of Borno state.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the result of the primary which held at the El-Kanemi sports centre in Maiduguri, Uba Ahmadu, chairman of the electoral committee, said Zulum polled 1,411 votes.\n\nHe said 1,560 voters were registered for the primary, while 1,422 voters were accredited, out of which 1,411 votes were recorded with no invalid vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZulum, in his acceptance speech, thanked stakeholders and delegates of the APC in the state, as well as the Borno people for their support.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The use of technology or the internet to connect patients to doctors goes as far back as 1994 (PDF) in the MENA region, when Egypt is considered that date is 2002. But wars, doctor and patient resistance, poor infrastructure, lack of funding, poor system quality, and lack of information technology training have hindered the adoption and growth of telemedicine in the MENA region.\n\nThese challenges and the pandemic which force the world to rethink access to healthcare, has created an underserved market for online medical consultation in the region.\n\nEsaal, a health and wellness startup, which has enjoyed unprecedented success in the MENA\u2019s telemedicine industry, has announced a $1.7 million seed investment from A15, according to a statement released by the MENA-focused company. Since its launch in 2018, Esaal has accumulated $3 million in funding, to fund its physical health and mental health and nutrition consultation services which it offers for subscription or on-demand consultation fees.\n\nEsaal\u2019s foray into mental health consultancy is not unrelated to Egypt\u2019s mental crisis, where one-quarter of the country\u2019s population is estimated to suffer from mental health issues. And despite nearly 3,800 people attempting to take their lives in the North African country, the stigma associated with seeking medical help for mental health related issues has further exacerbated the crisis. According to surveys, in the wider MENA region, (one-third) 35% of the MENA population frequently experience stress, while 29% suffer from depression, and even more adults increasingly suffer from obesity.\n\nEsaal enlists the help of over 350 consultants to provide health and wellness services, on a broad range of issues including anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition to its 1 million users. Esaal\u2019s users receive service offerings via text, video/voice calls and in-person home visits. At the end of each session, Esaal users can pay using cash, credit card, Fawry, or Vodafone.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCabal, Esaal said it saw a 250% Y-o-Y increase in revenue in 2021 and a 55% jump in users. This new funding will help it target further growth in the MENA market.\n\nEsaal\u2019s team. Image source: Esaal\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey building a solution we are supremely passionate about, with the unparalleled support of experienced and strategic investors such as A15, who are literally building this business alongside us, with expertise that has enabled our expansion into key target markets,\u201d Esaal\u2019s CEO, Fadi Doss said in a statement. \u201cWe have only scratched the surface in an untapped market and are actively working to secure further capital to fuel our continued growth. Esaal has become a name synonymous with trust, quality and access to health and wellness professionals that can help users obtain better outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we started working with the Esaal team, we knew this was a company with the laser focus and vision to create something truly unique and purpose-driven in its market. They have been prudent in the deployment of capital to date, demonstrating outstanding efficiencies in unit economics, which has enabled their expansion ambitions, \u201c A15\u2019S managing partner, Karim Beshara speaking on the investment. \u201cWe are proud to see their growth, and enjoyed building the business with them throughout the last four years.\u201d\n\nEsaal is currently available in 8 countries including Egypt, KSA, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine and Iraq; and wants to use its recent funding to further expand across the MENA region, invest in product and brand development, and increase talent acquisition.\n\n\u201cThere are millions more people across an enormous region that would benefit from our fresh approach to holistic health and we are thrilled to be in a position to keep growing and connecting more health professionals with patients in underserved markets,\u201d Doss said.\n\nEsaal, told TechCrunch, that it expects a revenue CAGR of around 50% to 60% between 2021 and 2025. This goal is supported by data which estimates that the telemedicine industry in Africa and the Middle East will grow from $3.86 billion in 2022 to $6.44 billion by 2021, with a CAGR of 10.80% over the forecast period.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has signed a 3-year intellectual property rights (IPR) agreement with Developing Africa Group (DAG) to create a marketplace where Nigerians can sell their intellectual property rights and receive royalties.\n\nThe platform will allow Nigerian creators commercialise registered intellectual property rights, and enable them to sell or exchange those rights internationally.\n\nGlobally, the intellectual property rights market is worth $8.2 billion and is set to reach $16.1 billion by 2026 with the advent of cloud-based solutions. Nigeria\u2019s deal with DAG is one such cloud-based IP solution.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the partnership will also see the launch of a nationwide wallet where Nigerians can collect royalties or payments\u2014in form of digital tokens or cryptocurrencies\u2014on any intellectual property rights they upload on the platform.\n\nThe Developing Africa Group (DAG), a UK-based IPR commercialisation group, has also announced that it will build the crypto-based platform on the Algorand Blockchain; while the tokenisation technology\u2014which includes the wallet and a stable coin-pegged token\u2014will be handled by Koibanx, an Argentina-based software company. Both Koibanx and Algorand have been involved in several similar crypto-based projects in Latin America including a national blockchain-based citizens ID and information programme in Colombia, and El Salvador\u2019s National Registration platform.\n\nIntellectual property in Nigeria\n\nIntellectual property rights (IPR) are the exclusive rights creators have over their works. Under IP laws, creators have the right to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use or re-create their work. Intellectual Property also includes the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance. They include the rights to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use their works. They also include the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance.\n\nIn Nigeria, intellectual property is divided into copyright, patents, trademarks and industrial designs, all governed by 4 different Acts. The country\u2019s Copyright Act governs the intellectual property rights of literary, artistic, musical works, broadcasting, recorded, and cinematographic works. Its Patent and Designs Act metes out laws guiding inventions, and industrial designs such as product designs. Its Trade Marks Act, and Merchandise Mark Act oversee the registration and regulation of trademarks like logos.\n\nJust like you have the freedom of movement or the freedom to post freely on social media, creators\u2014photographers, writers, painters, designers, and even scientists\u2014also have the rights to sell or rent out whatever unique things they create, subject to a few conditions.\n\nThis partnership between the Nigerian government and DAG will help Nigerian creators to benefit from their inventions and creators.\n\nNigeria\u2019s history with cryptocurrency\n\nThe deal brings into question Nigeria\u2019s shaky history with cryptocurrency.\n\nIts implementation will see crypto used in at least 2 ways: the building of the platform and wallet which will be on a blockchain network, and the use of a digital token\u2014which will be pegged to the naira. It\u2019s also possible that the deal could drive the usage of the CBN-backed e-naira.\n\nThese plans conflict with Nigeria\u2019s stance on crypto. In February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricted all commercial banks and crypto exchange platforms from crypto trading and has subsequently sanctioned erring platforms.\n\nIt subsequently launched its central bank digital currency (CBDC) months later with over 35,000 transactions recorded since its launch.\n\nMore recently, in May 2022, the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published new rules regulating the issuance, offering platforms, and custody of digital assets A.K.A cryptocurrencies which some experts say fails to address problems facing Nigeria\u2019s crypto industry.\n\nCommercialised IP rights for everyday Nigerians\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s blooming creator economy, the partnership means more visibility and income.\n\nA platform like this would allow anyone who identifies as a digital creator to sell their intellectual properties. Celebrities like Osita Iheme could sell rights to soundbites; photographers like Fati Abubakar could list rights to their photos, and even software engineers and product designers can sell rights to unique processes or designs (including logos) that are registered under Nigeria\u2019s patent law. The Nigerian film industry\u2014Nollywood\u2014could also raise funds by selling some of its features.\n\nWhen the deal comes to fruition, Nigeria\u2019s Copyright Commission (NCC) should see a rise in registration from Nigerians looking to make money selling their IP rights.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, and LinkedIn\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOl\u00e1,\n\nYou\u2019ve missed out if you haven\u2019t been listening to the Techpoint Africa Podcast, dear reader! Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to! The editorial team made me laugh; Bolu\u2019s story was one of the stories that drew me in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? The Central African Republic announced plans to launch SANGO, a bitcoin investment hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis follows a warning from the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) prohibiting banks in the region from collaborating with digital payment platforms. Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer.

Today we talked about the Kenyan government\u2019s plans to roll out a telemedicine programme. But that\u2019s not all we talked about, so let\u2019s not put the cart before the horse.\n\nFor one, the news of Uber reaching a billion rides in Africa warranted a mention, albeit brief. Oluwanifemi had some interesting tidbits concerning the length of time it took them to get this milestone on the continent, compared to India, South Asia, and the UK.\n\nBut it also made a nice segue into the African Mobility Conference organised by GIG Mobility which will hold on June 2, 2022, at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. With the theme, \u201cPathways to the future of mobility in Africa,\u201d there should be quite a lot to unpack, especially as regards shaping the mobility narrative on the continent. Register to attend here.\n\nFrom there, we moved on to discussions on the Kenyan government\u2019s plans to roll out a telemedicine programme. Thankfully, there were no debates like last week, but that was probably the calm before the storm.\n\nAnother topic on the discussion table was the Central African Republic\u2019s decision to launch an official crypto hub named Sango. You may recall the country revealing its plan to make Bitcoin a reference currency a few weeks ago.

These industry-enabling products are made possible by continued digitalization in government agencies such as FRSC and their continued mandate to enable growth in the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder/CEO, VerifyMe Nigeria, the plate number verification service is designed to fill the need for trusted real-time data within Nigeria\u2019s burgeoning vehicle and asset verification market. It will also enable insurance companies to instantly onboard customers while also maintaining full compliance and security.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the possibilities Plate Number Verification service offers in opening new opportunities for the insurance sector. This initiative, supported by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) will ensure trust in the system as the parties in a transaction can confirm the particulars of a vehicle real time and mitigate future issues and delays during claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) estimates that the auto-insurance sector has a N50 billion premium growth opportunity while about 77 percent of cars in the country are currently uninsured. This situation is exacerbated by the high number of unregistered vehicles and vehicles with fake registration licenses on the roads which significantly stunts motor-insurance penetration in the country.\n\nAdditionally, about 95 percent of the Nigerian auto market falls within the used car segment making it critical to verify the details of a vehicle for end-to-end transaction trust. The country also accounts for about 15% of Africa\u2019s ride-hailing app customers. The Vehicle License Number API will facilitate the seamless sale and purchasing of vehicles, boost consumer lending and enhance security within the space.\n\nRecognized as a leading African startup leveraging practical technology to solve Africa\u2019s problems, VerifyMe is noted for its innovative products and transformational leadership within the digital identity and open finance infrastructure space. The company was voted as a Notable Ecosystem Champion in Nigeria in the StartupBlink 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRiding on the back of Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s investment drive, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Zenith Bank, Suntrust Bank, among other investors have made commitments to the development of a 1,590-hectare oil palm plantation operated by Raedial Farms Limited.\n\nWith the global demand for oil palm on the increase amid supply disruptions, investors are taking advantage of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), to deepen imprints in the country\u2019s oil palm sector. Already, Edo has about 120,000 hectares of oil palm plantation under development.\n\nOther investors and stakeholders who visited the Raedial Farms facility in Iguomokhua village, Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State include Boston Advisory, CAGL Global, United Capital & United Bank of Africa (UBA). They were received by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Uwadiale Agenmonmen.\n\nAgenmonmen said work is in top gear to supply crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) to the market through the current expansion programme of its palm plantation and mill.\n\nHe stated that there was no better time to invest in palm oil cultivation and production in Nigeria other than now, particularly against the backdrop of the recent ban on the exportation of palm oil and oil palm produced by the Indonesian government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe business environment is interesting. There may be ups and downs but lately, the palm oil value chain has been the best in a while, fostered by Indonesia shutting down their export recently and thereby putting the pressure back home.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, people that normally import can no longer import palm oil and other products from Indonesia. So, the prices are going up and it is good for the farmers that actually cultivate and sell. In a nutshell, right now, the business environment is okay.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the financial support towards the growth of the industry, he stated that the major obstacle militating the success of farmers in the oil palm industry is largely occasioned by the set of conditions or evaluation commercial banks give to those who want to access the funds provided by CBN.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe farm sits on 1,509 hectares of land and has currently cultivated 700 hectares while another 500 hectares would be cultivated this year. The oil mill in the farm currently has the capacity of producing 16 tons of red oil every day and from palm kernel oil, it can produce 27 tons every day when there is a full stock of raw materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to bring our current investors and bankers here to physically see what we are doing because there is a difference when you talk to people about what you do on paper and phone calls. We want them to feel connected to where they have their money and with this, we look forward to better business opportunities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He noted that working together with other stakeholders, including all security agencies, the government will ensure a safe and conducive environment for people to live and do business without harassment and extortion.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have declared a complete war on land grabbers in the state. With the support of the Inspector General of Police, we are building trucks with guns and a barrack that will contain 100 men. We are working with the Private Property Protection Committee to come up with a list of petitions which is about 420. We will address all and ensure we end land grabbing in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor further added, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in the way we have gone in the past, where people build indiscriminately in the state, blocking waterways and causing erosion across the state. We want to create a culture of planning. We owe it to the people to set a path to the future of the state. It\u2019s on us to build the system and the people to own it, long after we leave office.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted that the stakeholders\u2019 meeting is important because of the role of the Christian Community in driving development in the state.\n\nHe urged, \u201cChurches must join us to correct the ills going on today and we need to start reordering the planning of the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of PFN in Edo State, Evang. Mrs. Margaret Agbonifo assured the governor that churches in the State will key into the Benin Master Plan and Edo Regional Development Plan to ensure development in the state.\n\nShe said, \u201cChurches have fallen prey to land grabbers in the past and that has affected churches in terms of building plans as they face disputes when developing the properties.\n\n\u201cWe have had a meeting with the churches under PFN in the state and we all have agreed to key into the plan by ensuring we all register our churches. We are ready to submit our building plans but appeal to the governor to approve such plans.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of Edo CAN, Bishop Oyenude Kure promised the support of Christians to ensure sustainable development in the state.\n\nOn her part, Commissioner for Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Isoken Omo, noted, \u201cCAN is important to the project as the state knows you are a key influencer within the state and beyond.

We have been able to grow our economy to align with its potential. We are addressing a whole lot of issues, particularly security and healthcare to sort out the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working to fire our economy to the extent that we utilize the economy to the benefit of our people, and one key driver for us is agriculture; food. The number one pressing issue in Nigeria today is food availability.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure we focus on food production and economic growth. We are engaging with our young people and trying to position them to take advantage of the opportunities in culture and technology globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to be competitive economically, the key asset you need are your people; the key driver they need is education. They have to be educated. We are emphasizing education, particularly basic education,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his government\u2019s commitment to ending the menace of human trafficking and illegal migration in Edo, Obaseki further noted, \u201cWe realized that it is that lack of hope and poor education that fuels irregular migration, and we have tried as much as we can to curtail that menace of irregular migration by creating hope for them; nobody wants to leave home if the home is comfortable.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the success recorded by his administration in the health sector, the governor said the state partnered with the Association of Nigeria Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) to provide free medical outreach to Edo people.\n\nHe said, \u201cA couple of weeks ago, we received 67 medical practitioners in our state and they worked with our personnel on ground to improve quality healthcare delivery to our people. For us, with healthcare, it\u2019s about the foundation. If we have the basic health footprint right, as well as the training of community healthcare heads, then it will not be too challenging dealing with diseases such as malaria and distributing vaccines.\u201d\n\nOn culture, Obaseki added, \u201cFor us as government, our goal is to position Edo for the subcontinent. We are working with the European Government in the areas of storage and preservation facilities and the Nigeria Government, to strengthen the national museum monuments\u2019 facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the Royal Palace in building a royal collection and the whole idea is to build the Edo Museum of West Africa Art (EMOWAA) where you will have a lot to see when you come in.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her speech, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, saluted the government for its anti-trafficking laws, noting that they have helped in curbing irregular migration among young people in the state.\n\nWhile reassuring the support of the United States, she further hailed the Obaseki-led government for its various programmes to positively engage Edo youths.\n\nLeonard further revealed that museums in the United States of America are intensifying efforts to repatriate Benin artifacts in their possession.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

That suit is still pending.\n\nMr Ada was, however, arrested in September 2021 but released thereafter.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police on January 18 filed a child molestation charge against Mr Ada at the Abuja court.\n\nThe one-count criminal charge read, \u201cThat you, lgoche Daniel Ada \u2018m\u2019 39yrs, on or about 25/04/2021 at about 21:15hrs at the school premises of Destiny Christian Academy Airport Road FCT, Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did sexually harassed one \u2026 aged 14yrs by touching and caressing her breast and other sexual parts, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 32 (1) and punishable under section 32 (2) of Child Right Act LFN 2003.\u201d",

Etido Inyang and secretary of the Company, Barr. Ime Asibong signed for Ibom Power; while Jemeriah Oluwaseun and Christabel Nwagum (CEO of African Delta and secretary respectively) signed the agreement on behalf of African Delta Power.\n\nAt the ceremony held at the office of the Secretary to Akwa Ibom State Government and Chairman of the One-Stop-Shop on Investment Committee, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, it was disclosed that the proposed power plant will be developed as part of the phase 2 of the IPP.\n\nThe SSG stated that the agreement was \u201cnot an MoU but rather it is a step further, which has transited the MoU phase\u201d. He said the proposed power project is under the \u2018Power for All\u2019 initiative of governor Udom Emmanuel, which was inaugurated about two years ago by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nDr. Ekuwem urged the investors to follow up the agreement by living up to the letters as enshrined in the terms of the contract.\n\nOn the implementation of the project, the One-Stop-Shop on Investment Committee Chairman urged the African Delta Power team to speed up the processes and abide by the roadmap agreed to by the government for the project.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Chairman of Ibom Power Company Limited, Engr. Etido Inyang said the first phase of Ibom power is already operational with an installed capacity of 191megawatts. He said Ibom Power has a license to generate 685megawatts of power which the proposed power plant will leverage on.\n\n\u201cWe have a delta of the remainder of the license that which is 685megawatts. They are coming in with their first phase of 366megawatts with plans to expand to 732megawatts which we will get an additional license to support\u201d.\n\nGiving further insights, the Board Chairman revealed that the Company had received many bids from several investors that had shown firm interest to partner with Ibom Power for its Phase 2 but African Delta Power has proven to be \u2018outstanding\u2019.\n\n\u2018Their technical partners have been supportive and we have seen the turbines that are coming in. We have seen that they have evidence of funding that will be deployed in the installation of these turbines and they are going to commence groundbreaking within the first week of June\u2019, he stated.\n\nThe Managing Director of Ibom Power, Engr. Meyen Etukudo expressed satisfaction over the deal and described it as \u2018mutually rewarding\u2019 for both parties with great prospects for the future. The Phase 2 of Ibom Power, according to him, will ensure the company continues to break more frontiers.\n\nOn how the project will be implemented within the stipulated nine months period, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of African Delta Power, Jeremiah Oluwaseun said, most of the turbines and the systems have been prefabricated so they are ready to be deployed with their foreign technical partners from the United States.\n\n\u2018Once a few other things are put in place, this equipment will be shipped in, in phases for onward installation here\u201d.\n\nOluwaseun who led his team consisting of the GM-Operations, Kelechi Samuel Anyamele; GM-Admin, Christabel Nwagum and the CLO, Etim Ayara said that Akwa Ibom was selected for the project because the state had the prerequisites for the project. In his words, Akwa Ibom State \u2018has the gas, a welcoming environment, good partners and a state government that is willing to go ahead with the project\u2019.",

          "text": "The Government of Akwa Ibom State has entered into a co-location and power production pact with African Delta Power Limited to add the additional 366 megawatts to the existing 191 megawatts of the state-owned Ibom power plant.\n\nThe new deal shows that the aggregate maximum capacity of the gas turbine generator units is capable of producing up to 732 megawatts although Ibom Power will need to apply to the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) for licence expansion to cover the expanded license.\n\nCurrently, the company has an on-grid license for 685 megawatts.\n\nThe agreement was signed on behalf of the State Government by the Attorney-General and commissioner for Justice, Uko Udom SAN while the Board chairman of Ibom Power, Engr. Etido Inyang and secretary of the Company, Barr. Ime Asibong signed for Ibom Power; while Jemeriah Oluwaseun and Christabel Nwagum (CEO of African Delta and secretary respectively) signed the agreement on behalf of African Delta Power.\n\nAt the ceremony held at the office of the Secretary to Akwa Ibom State Government and Chairman of the One-Stop-Shop on Investment Committee, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, it was disclosed that the proposed power plant will be developed as part of the phase 2 of the IPP.\n\nThe SSG stated that the agreement was \u201cnot an MoU but rather it is a step further, which has transited the MoU phase\u201d. He said the proposed power project is under the \u2018Power for All\u2019 initiative of governor Udom Emmanuel, which was inaugurated about two years ago by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nDr. Ekuwem urged the investors to follow up the agreement by living up to the letters as enshrined in the terms of the contract.\n\nOn the implementation of the project, the One-Stop-Shop on Investment Committee Chairman urged the African Delta Power team to speed up the processes and abide by the roadmap agreed to by the government for the project.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Chairman of Ibom Power Company Limited, Engr. Etido Inyang said the first phase of Ibom power is already operational with an installed capacity of 191megawatts. He said Ibom Power has a license to generate 685megawatts of power which the proposed power plant will leverage on.\n\n\u201cWe have a delta of the remainder of the license that which is 685megawatts. They are coming in with their first phase of 366megawatts with plans to expand to 732megawatts which we will get an additional license to support\u201d.\n\nGiving further insights, the Board Chairman revealed that the Company had received many bids from several investors that had shown firm interest to partner with Ibom Power for its Phase 2 but African Delta Power has proven to be \u2018outstanding\u2019.\n\n\u2018Their technical partners have been supportive and we have seen the turbines that are coming in. We have seen that they have evidence of funding that will be deployed in the installation of these turbines and they are going to commence groundbreaking within the first week of June\u2019, he stated.\n\nThe Managing Director of Ibom Power, Engr. Meyen Etukudo expressed satisfaction over the deal and described it as \u2018mutually rewarding\u2019 for both parties with great prospects for the future. The Phase 2 of Ibom Power, according to him, will ensure the company continues to break more frontiers.\n\nOn how the project will be implemented within the stipulated nine months period, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of African Delta Power, Jeremiah Oluwaseun said, most of the turbines and the systems have been prefabricated so they are ready to be deployed with their foreign technical partners from the United States.\n\n\u2018Once a few other things are put in place, this equipment will be shipped in, in phases for onward installation here\u201d.\n\nOluwaseun who led his team consisting of the GM-Operations, Kelechi Samuel Anyamele; GM-Admin, Christabel Nwagum and the CLO, Etim Ayara said that Akwa Ibom was selected for the project because the state had the prerequisites for the project. In his words, Akwa Ibom State \u2018has the gas, a welcoming environment, good partners and a state government that is willing to go ahead with the project\u2019.",

          "text": "As the Osun governorship election draws near, members of the Nigerian Automobile Technician Association (NATA) have endorsed and passed vote of confidence in the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun for turning around the socio-economic fortunes of the State.\n\nThe artisans also professed thier readiness to vote massively for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in the next governorship election in the State.\n\nThey assured the Governor of over 10,000 votes saying all their members across the State will vote massively to ensure his return.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the members of NATA, the Southwest Zonal Vice Chairman, Comrade Samson Odewale, said they have resolved to mobilise massively to get him elected.\n\nOdewale who lauded the Governor for his continued support to workers particularly those in the informal sector, said no amount of persuasion will make them to deviate from the cause to get him re-elected.\n\n\u201cWe are endorsing Mr Governor for a second term because of his modest achievements in the last three and a half years. We are not politicians but as citizens we have seen every reason to support a government that means well for the people.\n\n\u201cAs artisans, we have so many reasons to support the Governor for what he has been doing particularly to stimulate the economy of the state without borrowing a Kobo anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cIn view of our work as professionals whose impact to livelihood is central to the economy and daily living of the citizens, we have seen the pace of progression in all strata of the economy in the State since the assumption of the present Administration.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here to show our love, our passion and interest in the administration that has turned around the fortunes of the State with the meagre resources available to us as a State. It is a known fact that our amiable Governor has proved his capacity to take Osun to greater heights.\n\n\u201cWe have already mobilised our people and I can assure you that over 10,000 members in Osun will vote for him. He has proved to us that he is capable and to us, we have assessed and measured his performance and we have come to conclusion to support him and vote massively for him.\n\n\u201cTo us, what Mr. Governor has done without resorting to borrowing is not only unprecedented but undoable for many of his colleagues, that is why we have rated him as the best Governor whose positive impacts have been tremendously felt across sectors.\n\n\u201cMost importantly in the areas of education, road infrastructure, health, security, workers\u2019 welfare, agriculture and most importantly the execution of people-oriented policies and programmes that had helped in no small measure on the general welfare and well-being of the citizenry\u201d, he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the newly-elected State Chairman, NATA, Comrade Muideen Azeez, attributed their endorsement to the good works of the Governor saying his administration has been very impactful.\n\n\u201cWe are here to tell the world where we belong. We want the entire world to know why we have resolved to identify and endorse the governor for second term.\n\n\u201cAs artisans, the policies and programmes of Mr Governor have been very impactful on the lives of the citizens particularly the artisans. This is a government that has been paying full salaries regularly, constructing several kilometers of roads, providing quality and qualitative education, guaranteeing the security of lives and property of the citizens and above all, implementing policies that are pro- masses.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the government of our maximum support and huge votes in the next governorship election and I urge the people of the State to vote for him because he has done and performed excellently well\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola commended the Association for their unflinching support for his administration, describing them as one of the very critical stakeholders to the Osun project.\n\nOyetola, while commenting on the Association\u2019s praise for his administration\u2019s prioritisation of workers\u2019 welfare, reiterated his commitment to improved welfare of workers in the state, saying he will continue to do what is necessary for the wellbeing of the people and prosperity of the state.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI am happy with your coming this morning. You have shown us unflinching support and we acknowledge that support. We have tried our best to patronise your association in our own way, but we have also indirectly contributed to your businesses by improving the welfare of our workers.\n\n\u201cI value workers so much, because I know that it is not fair for them to work without getting paid as and when due. God has honoured my commitment in ways that beat my imaginations. God has always made a way of escape for us amid the scarce resources.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this commitment is that it has also increased patronage of businesses in the state. I make bold to say that your businesses are thriving because the purchasing power of our people, especially workers, has been tremendously improved.\n\n\u201cWe are not relenting. We will continue to do what is necessary for the prosperity of the state and our people and I trust that none of us will regret our associations together\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nNATA members had earlier in the morning embarked on a solidarity walk from the popular Nelson Mandela Freedom Park to Government House, as part of efforts to register their support for the Governor who they described as a man of the people.",

          "text": "Leading House of Representatives aspirant for Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency in Abia state, Chief Mrs Mary Ikoku, has appealed to the All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates to vote for her at the party primaries scheduled to hold on Friday May 27, 2022.\n\nMary, a media guru and notable social advocate spoke in a press statement through her campaign organisation on Thursday.\n\nThe House of Representatives frontline APC aspirant who has been known for her philanthropic gestures over the years within Arochukwu and Ohafia communities and beyond reminded delegates of the need for them to collectively make pronounced decision that would take their domain out of persistent hardship.\n\nPart of her statement titled, \u201cThe Dawn of Transparency and Accountability\u201d, reads, \u201cThese are two vital attributes that have, historically, been found to be deficit in the Nigerian polity transparency and accountability. This deficit in transparency and accountability has caused us a lot in good governance, development and progress.\n\n\u201cThe failure to hold our elected office holders and representatives responsible and accountable for their actions and inactions have given them the confidence to act insensitively to our needs and to brazenly misuse public funds for selfish reasons.\u201d\n\nMary, who was recently singled out and honoured with a rare Chieftaincy title of \u201cNwanyi bu Ihe\u201d in Ohafia said, \u201cThe Arochukwu and Ohafia communities have not only been neglected but also taken for granted. We have representatives at the corridors of power and yet it appears we have no one. Every four years, we come out to entrust our mandate into the hands of people whom we assume will ably represent us where it matters.\n\n\u201cBut alas! we always get disappointed\u2026time and time again. Look at our youth! Look at our women! Imagine our roads turning to death traps. All around us, we see decaying and degenerating infrastructure from schools to hospitals and even housing.\n\n\u201cYet, we have people we dutifully elected to ably represent us to ensure that our problems are fixed for us to live better lives. Dear Delegates, the decision to continue with this sad reality or to make a decisive change for a better future is in your hands. Make a determination to vote your conscience so that you can birth a new dawn in Arochukwu-Ohafia community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for change! Today, I present myself to you as that candidate who will represent you transparently and accountably.\n\n\u201cI present myself to you with all humility, deep sense of responsibility and understanding of the seriousness of this moment and the challenges ahead of us as a people and a constituency. You have been made promises in the past and disappointed, but today is different.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the moment and the depth of the developmental challenges before us calls us to responsibility and solemnity. My fathers and mothers, my brothers and sisters, my leaders and elders, my name is Mary Ikoku.\n\n\u201cI have served you and this community with compelling commitment as a private citizen over the last two decades. Today, I stand before you with the weight of history, the knowledge of the pains of our people, the needs of our community and an abiding hope in your capacity to make that bold and courageous choice that will signal the beginning of a new kind of politics of performance and service.\n\n\u201cMy antecedents speak eloquently of service and transformative leadership. I come fully prepared to take up the office of House of Representatives from day one and begin to deliver tangible and meaningful results.\n\n\u201cI have served successfully in the public sector, organised private sector and NGO sector and I stand ready to take up this higher calling. So, dear distinguished delegates, as you vote today, I urge you to fairly and wisely assess all the aspirants and ask yourself who is that one person that you are convinced will give you the purposeful, transparent, accountable and high-impact representation that you deserve and seek.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, has tasked the federal government to identify unknown gunmen and force them out of forests and urban hideouts across the country for prosecution.\n\nAccording to the Sultan, the term \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 used to describe killers of innocent Nigerians was no longer tenable, as the gunmen are known but only ignored.\n\nHis Eminence thus called for the constitution of a joint task force to specially attend to the rising tide of killings in South-Eastern Nigeria, while urging governments at all levels to go beyond verbal condemnations on security related atrocities.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday in a statement signed by JNI Secretary-General, Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu, the Sultan condemned what he described as senseless, barbaric and unprovoked killing of a pregnant woman with four of her children in Anambra state, saying that, killings in South-East are now transforming to being more religious and ethno/tribal conflicts, the escalation of which may not bode well for the country.\n\nThe Sultan called for intensified efforts in identifying and prosecuting \u201cthe so called unknown gunmen\u201d, adding that governments at all levels should collaborate with security agencies in tackling insecurities in whatever guises.\n\nHe called for proactive measures in nipping the situations in the buds, before it becomes uncontrollable, while urging governments to strategize and bring an end to orgies of killings happening across in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAt the instance of its President-General, His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji (Dr.) Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, the Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) condemns the senseless, barbaric and unprovoked killing of one Harira Jibrin; a pregnant woman with four of her children at Isulo in Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State. The incident is but an addition to the series of many other killings meted, particularly to Muslims in the South-Eastern states of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe recurring heartless, calamitous and unprovoked killings and maiming in South-East, as well as across other parts of the country are, to say the least condemnable. JNI has painfully, with dismay been observing the orchestrated unchecked atrocities dished out to many innocent Muslim menial traders\u2019 wares including animals.\n\n\u201cThe attitude, in effect, depicts the most unfortunate high level of hatred and impunity. The JNI feels that it was high time the governments acted lest things get out of hand. While we commiserate with all families affected with the serial killings and abductions in Nigeria, we implore the Federal Government to synergise with all state governments enmeshed in all forms of security challenges, for the restoration of law and order.\n\n\u201cThe killings are now transforming to being more religious and ethnic/tribal conflicts. Their escalation may not be easily halted. Nigerians should learn from different historical accounts that, religious or ethnic conflicts and wars are undoubtedly extremely preposterous. So, they should be avoided. We call on governments at all levels to, as a matter of urgency, do everything possible to curtail the situation and arrest all those who are behind the ongoing killings in the South-Eastern Nigeria, before it is too late.\n\n\u201cGovernments should be seen as swiftly acting on security related issues, as it is its primary constitutional responsibility to protect, secure and provide welfare to citizens, as enunciated in the second schedule of the 1999 amended Constitution. Government must spare no efforts to take control of all forests and swampy areas that have become hideouts for criminals. Examples should be set by speedily arresting and prosecuting all criminals, devoid of legal encumbrances.\n\n\u201cConstituting commissions of inquiry should NOT be the only way to go. Nigerians desperately yearn for more concrete actions against all forms of criminalities. The unfortunate spate of the alarming horrendous butchering of human lives in the Nigerian states should be halted. South-Eastern states\u2019 governments and governors, as well as community leaders should be seen and heard condemning and assuaging fears and tension within their respective states and communities (as the case may be).\n\n\u201cSilence would not be golden, in so unfortunate a situation. Perhaps they should emulate the Northern Governors in reacting quickly and appropriately, on similar happenings within their jurisdictions; security surveillance should, maximally be accorded Muslim communities in the South-Eastern Nigeria,\u201d the Sultan added.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Ahead of the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential primaries scheduled for Sunday, the party\u2019s leadership Wednesday said consensus arrangement on its choice candidate is not on the table for now.\n\nAPC National Chairman Senator Abdullah Adamu revealed this while speaking to some select journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe party leader, who reiterated his commitment to ensuring level\n\nEchoes of consensus\n\nThere have been some calls for consensus by some APC stakeholders to pick its presidential candidate.\n\nSpecifically, there were permutations by party faithful that the leadership at the national level would galvanise the 25 APC aspirants to forge a consensus in the same manner they did during their last national convention to elect party executives.\n\nFor instance, seven South-east presidential aspirants on the party\u2019s platform resolved last Sunday to support any aspirant from the region who gets the parties ticket for the 2023 general election.\n\nAlso, two presidential aspirants namely former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole and former Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba also lent their voices for a consensus arrangement.\n\nOn the contrary, however, No Alternative To Tunubu 2023 (NATT2023) \u2013 a support group of APC national leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, kicked against consensus arrangement, saying it put limits to several available choices.\n\nBut the APC consensus became necessary against the backdrop that the PDP, the major opposition party, had thrown its presidential race open to all the regions of the country.\n\nThe consensus if formed would help nip in the bud the rancorous and acrimonious situation likely to arise in the aftermath of the party primaries.\n\nParty\u2019s stand\n\nBut speaking in an interview Wednesday at the party\u2019s national secretariat, the APC national chairman, Senator Adamu, said \u201cthe party has its own rules and strategies, which I will not expose now. What I can say for now is, all the aspirants would be assessed to measure their competence during the primary.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cit is normal that you can\u2019t stop many people from aspiring for a position, and it is ecstatic for us that they are aspiring for the position under the platform of our great party. We thank God, we also thank them. Aspiring for a political position is not an offense, but victory is the will of God. Everybody can contest, but you should know that, when God chooses the winner, those who are faithful to God, will succumb and even work for the final victor.\n\n\u201cSo, what I want to point out here is, even a mad man knows that twenty eight aspirants cannot be president at the same time. Only one will! Therefore, what we can do as the leaders of the party, is to be just to all of them. We know that we are not saints, we are not perfect, but we pray for God to help us do justice to everybody.\u201d\n\nWhen further pressed on whether at the party level, they would have any arrangement to produce a \u2018unity candidate\u2019 as it happened during election of party executives last March, 2022, he said: \u201cContesting for the position of a party chairman or any party executive position is not the same as the position of the president. The enthusiasm and desire to acquire the position of a party chairman is not as strong as that of a president\u2019s seat. It is incomparable!\u201d\n\nLawal halts consultation\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has put off all his political engagements for Wednesday to mourn the farmers killed by the terrorists in Borno state Sunday.\n\nMore than 50 farmers were reportedly killed at the outskirts of Kala Balge local government area by terrorists suspected to be Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nLawan had already scheduled some engagements for Wednesday one of which was to meet with the APC leaders and delegates in Borno state.\n\nHe was also scheduled to proceed from Maiduguri to Gombe also to meet party leaders and particularly, the delegates to canvas support for his presidential bid ahead of the upcoming primaries but decided to put off all his political engagements for the day on account of the tragic incident and instead proceeded to Maiduguri only on a condolence visit.\n\nWhile in Maiduguri, the Senate President met with Governor Babagana Umara Zulum and the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai to commiserate with the government and people of Borno state.\n\nAt the Palace of Shehu of Borno, Lawan said: \u201cWe are in Maiduguri for a very solemn event. We had wanted to come to meet with the delegates in continuation of the campaign for the flag of our Party, the APC, for the Presidential race.\n\n\u201cBecause of the sad event that took place in Kala Balge where over 50 of our people were killed, we felt that it was only appropriate to come to Borno to condole with the Government and people of Borno state.\n\n\u201cWe pray that Almighty Allah will forgive their sins and Aljannah Firdaus be their final resting place.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the Borno state Government House, the Senate President told the Governor that all his political engagements for Wednesday had been put off in honour of the farmers who were killed by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore here to condole with you, the government and people of Borno state for this loss. This is a time for sympathy and empathy. This is not time for politics.\n\n\u201cSo we have come to condole with you and of course we have put off the political engagements in honour of our citizens who were killed by Boko Haram ISWAP.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, let me commend you for everything that you have been doing in Borno state and particularly your concern in ensuring that you continue to partner with the Federal government to fight the insurgency here and also ensure that all the IDPs are back into their communities.\u201d\n\nResponding, Governor Zulum thanked the Senate President and his entourage for the gesture.\n\nHe said Borno and Yobe, the home state of the Senate President were one and prayed that the existing relationship between the two states \u201cwill never be soured.\u201d\n\nObi dumps PDP\n\nAnd barely 72 hours to the PDP National Convention to elect its 2023 presidential candidate, an aspirant and former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi has dumped the party.\n\nObi announced this in a letter addressed to the party\u2019s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, dated 24th May 2022 titled \u201cResignation From Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Withdrawal From the Presidential Contest said his decision has been conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2. Anaocha LGA Anambra since Friday 20 May 2022.\n\nThe letter obtained by Blueprint, Wednesday, signed by Obi partly read \u201cConsequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP Presidential Primaries.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.\n\n\u201cOur national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country\u201d.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, a former aide to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and Director-General Peter Obi Campaign Organisation, Dr Doyin Okupe, assured that the former governor\u2019s name would be on the 2023 ballot.\n\nHe said \u201d You recall that consistently, former governor Peter Obi has repeatedly stated that his not desperate to be President, but he is desperate to cause a change, to cause a redirection to change the way the government of Nigeria is being run.\n\n\u201cAnd to offer solutions to various problems of Nigeria, it is for these reasons he entered into the race. But the various development within the PDP makes it virtually impossible for him.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that all hopes all lost. I can say on his behalf that Nigerians must not give up, we must never give up. Hope is on its way and help is coming\u201d.\n\nOn Obi\u2019s next line of action is, Okupke said: \u201cAll options are on the table. By the grace of Almighty God, Peter Obi will be on the ballot for the 2023 Presidency.\u201d\n\nBlueprint gathered that Obi may likely join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) led by former Kano state governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso.\n\nSources in the former Anambra State governor\u2019s camp also hinted that he was considering Labour Party.\n\n\u201cNNPP would have been an option, but Kwankwaso is already a candidate, so LP is an option. He will announce soon.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

the farmer\u2019s Anchor Borrower Programme that just witnessed first of its kind of rice pyramid a few months ago.\n\n\u201cWhen Godwin Emefiele assumed office as the 10th indigenous Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria on June 3, 2014, he promised to build a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of the Nigeria economy.\n\n\u201cToday, even the blind, deaf and dump can attest to the fact that the Apex Bank\u2019s policies and programmes have been so designed in such a way that jobs are being created and fostering inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cIn addition, to key macroeconomic concerns such as inflation and exchange rate stability in the country.\n\n\u201cHe has been able to mobilize the private sector and salvage the situation, despite the harsh financial state of the country, he also introduced several policies to support the poor; the farmer\u2019s Anchor Borrower Programme that just witnessed first of its kind of rice pyramid a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThrough his people based policies, Nigerians have been offered numerous interventions and support for Small Medium Enterprises, SMEs and others.\n\n\u201cAnd this has created support base for local companies to be competitive, and evidently, this support culminated in the commissioning of the Dangote Fertilizer Company, and these are aimed at supporting Nigerian farmers to produce more food and also create jobs.\n\n\u201cUnder his watch in CBN for the first time, he ensured diversification of the source of the economy from the oil sector to the non-oil sector.\n\n\u201cWe can go on and on about Emefiele\u2019s professional policy formulation that has been so all encompassing and not leaving any segment of Nigerians behind, but has carried Nigerians along with the policies and programmes of the CBN.\u201d\n\nHowever, the group in its address unanimously called on the Nigerian Policy Force to arrest those who have reported and spread fake news about the purported sack of the CBN Governor on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe condemn those who just woke up from their mischief to relay fake news about the alleged sack of the CBN Governor on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is handiwork of some politicians who have nothing to offer because they have run out of steam and are only out to blackmail the CBN Governor with such sponsored fake news.\n\n\u201cWe want to call on the Nigerian Police Force, and other relevant security agencies to go after and arrest those who are behind this fake news, and should be dealt with accordingly because this is not good for the image of our revered Apex Bank\u201d, the group added.",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

The Lagos State APC State Exco, headed by one pastor Cornelius Ojelabi, is complicit in the exercise of this blatant rape of democracy in APC Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe also note that the Screening Committee, which was inaugurated by the APC National Headquarters to screen all Governorship Aspirants in Lagos State, has refused to publish the results of the screening exercise as at the time of this press release. The approved Election Guidelines of the APC mandates the Screening Committee to release its results within 24 hours of concluding the screening exercise, so as to give participating aspirants an opportunity to appeal the outcome of the screening at the APC Screening Appeals Committee. I cannot understand why the Screening Committee chose not to contact the aspirants screened by them, either by phone call, text message, written letter, or any other means of communication, considering their decision to withhold the results of the screening. This is a serious breach of aspirants\u2019 fundamental rights to fair hearing, as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that my candidacy in this2022 APC primary elections has generated massive positive excitement from party members and Lagosians generally. It has also created serious discomfort for those who are afraid of my message of a new agenda and accountability in governance. These discomforted powerful individuals have even gone to great lengths to prevent me from participating in the primary election of today by excluding me in a manner similar to the last Edo State episode where a sitting governor was denied participation in the internal democracy process of his party. The resultant effects of that misadventure still lives with the party till date. The extent to which these same individuals have succeeded in their desperate scheming will become apparent when the Screening Committee eventually decides to \u201crelease\u201d the results of the screening (which is already 12 days in arrears), however the will of the people will not be subverted.\n\n\u201cI implore my teeming supporters to remain calm and law abiding, despite the provocations. We will continue to seek redress from the internal dispute resolution mechanisms of the party, without foreclosing the enforcement of our rights to seek justice in the Court of Law.\u201d",

The wounded included \u201cmultiple children\u201d who survived the gunfire in their classroom, Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Chris Olivarez said.\n\nThe shooter\u2019s online posts were made on Facebook, the governor said, but spokespeople for Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta Platforms (FB.O), said they were private one-to-one messages discovered after the shooting. The company declined to say who received the messages or which of Meta\u2019s platforms, such as Messenger or Instagram, was used to send them.\n\nVictims\u2019 loved ones took to social media to express anguish over the loss of children who never came home from school.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cWe told her we loved her and would pick her up after school,\u201d Kimberly Mata-Rubio posted on Facebook in a remembrance of her daughter, Alexandria Aniyah Rubio, a fourth-grade honor student. \u201cWe had no idea this was goodbye.\u201d read more\n\nGUN CONTROL DEBATE\n\nInvestigators have not suggested a motive for the shooting, and little about the suspect\u2019s background immediately came to light.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s mother, Adriana Reyes, was quoted in an interview with the British-based news site DailyMail.com describing her son as someone who \u201ckept to himself and didn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d\n\nTen days earlier an avowed white supremacist shot 13 people at a supermarket in a mostly Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, re-igniting a national debate over U.S. gun laws.\n\nIn a sign of the charged political atmosphere, Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic candidate challenging Abbott in a November election, interrupted the news conference to confront the governorover the state\u2019s permissive gun laws, shouting \u201cYou are doing nothing!\u201d read more\n\nSeveral officials gathered on stage around the governor yelled at O\u2019Rourke. \u201cYou\u2019re a sick son of a bitch who would come to a deal like this to make a political issue,\u201d one of them said, though it was not clear who.\n\nO\u2019Rourke was escorted from the building and spoke to reporters outside. He said it was \u201cinsane\u201d that an 18-year-old was legally permitted to acquire a semi-automatic rifle and vowed to pursue gun restrictions.\n\nAbbott said stringent gun laws do not prevent violence, citing states such as New York.
