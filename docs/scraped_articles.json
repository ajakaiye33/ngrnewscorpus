          "text": "The European Commission wants to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, under a massive plan to fight climate change unveiled on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to one of a dozen draft laws revealed in Brussels, emissions from motor vehicles must fall by 55 percent by 2030 and drop to zero by 2035.\n\n\u201cAs a result, all new cars registered as of 2035 will be zero emission,\u201d the statement announcing the plan said.\n\nThis would in practice mean that all cars and light vans sold from that date will be battery-powered electric cars, which currently represent less than a tenth of new registrations in the EU.\n\nThe move is sure to be fiercely opposed by some in the industry lobby as it makes its way through an intense negotiating and drafting process and scrutiny in the European parliament.\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturer\u2019s Association (ACEA) said it supported efforts to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050, as envisaged by draft climate laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, banning a single technology is not a rational way forward at this stage,\u201d it added, referring to plans to reduce road traffic emissions to zero by 2035.\n\nPressure group Transport and Environment welcomed the plan as a \u201cturning point\u201d for green motoring.\n\nBut executive director William Todts warned: \u201cThe problem is carmakers will only have to start selling those cleaner cars in 2030.\n\n\u201cOur planet cannot afford another nine years of big talk but little action from the auto industry.\u201d\n\nAnd there is caution among member states like France, Germany, Spain and Italy which have a large sectors manufacturing traditional combustion engine vehicles and hybrids that support hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nPoliticians fear that motorists will see fuel prices rising as a result of carbon levies and as they are pushed to sell their gas-guzzlers and buy new electric cars.\n\nThe recent \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests in France demonstrated the kind of populist fury that environmental controls on motoring can provoke.\n\nBut European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen insisted the transition was vital if Europe is to meet emissions reduction targets and that the public was rallying behind it.\n\n\u201cAbout a dozen of the large automotive companies both in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have announced that they are going to switch their fleet to exclusively emission-free vehicles,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cWe see that people want these developments, there\u2019s been a huge increase in the number signing up for electric vehicles,\u201d she said, noting that the US market has tripled over the past year.\n\nOliver Zipse, president of the ACEA lobby group and chief executive of BMW, stressed that the plan would \u201conly be successful with mandatory targets for the ramp-up of charging and refuelling infrastructure in all member states.\n\n\u201cThis will be essential to charge the millions of electric vehicles that European automakers will be bringing to market in the coming years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Economic fallout \u2013\n\nMotorised road transport is Europeans\u2019 most common way of getting about, but it represents 15 percent of the bloc\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and Brussels aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nEconomic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has hit the road vehicle market hard, but electric cars have been an exception, with growth accelerating.\n\nBattery-powered cars represented eight percent of new registrations in western Europe in the first five months of this year, with 356,000 new vehicles, more than in all of 2019.\n\nThe impending new regulations will increase this trend, as they will not only spell doom for classic petrol and diesel motors but effectively force out hybrid and hybrid-rechargeable models.\n\nThese had once been seen as a transitional technology, a key product for an industry that boasts of employing 14.6 million workers in Europe.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri \u2013 Abuja\n\nDetained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, has filed an application before the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking to be transferred from the custody of the Department of State Service, DSS, to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje.\n\nKanu, in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, decried that he has been denied access to his medical doctors.\n\nHe said he might die in the custody of the DSS if nothing was done to urgently address his deteriorating health condition.\n\nHe specifically applied for an order of the trial court, \u201cdirecting the transfer of the Applicant from the custody of the National Headquarters of the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before he was granted bail, pending the determination of the charge\u201d.\n\nAs well as, \u201cAn order of this Honourable Court directing the Defendant/Applicant\u2019s custodian, to grant access to his medical experts/doctors to carry out a comprehensive independent medical examination of the defendant/applicant\u2019s health condition/status, while in custody.\u201d\n\nIt will be recalled that Kanu whose whereabouts was hitherto unknown, was on June 27 returned back to the country after he was arrested from a yet to be confirmed African country.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, had insisted that he lawfully \u201cintercepted\u201d as a result of a collaborative effort of various security agencies in the country.\n\nHowever, Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Ejiofor, disclosed that his client was on June 18, illegally arrested at the airport and detained for eight days by Kenya\u2019s Special Police Force before he was eventually handed over to their Nigerian counterpart.\n\nEjiofor alleged that the IPOB leader was tortured and subjected to various forms of inhuman treatment in Kenya, a situation he said worsened his health condition.\n\nTrial Justice Binta Nyako had upon Kanu\u2019s return to Nigeria, ordered his remand in DSS custody, even as his trial on a treasonable felony charge, which was initially fixed for October, was brought forward to June 26.\n\nMeanwhile, in the fresh application, Kanu alleged that he has been \u201csubjected to mental and psychological torture\u201d by the DSS, saying it would be in the interest of justice for the court to order his transfer to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre which he described as \u201can impartial facility that has no interest whatsoever\u201d in the outcome of his trial.\n\nAn affidavit he attached in support of the application, read: \u201cThat this charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came up on 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\nALSO READ: Reps receive reports on electoral Amendment Bill\n\n\u201cThat the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO. FCH/ABJ/CR/383/2015 on that 29th June 2021.\n\n\u201cThat on 30th June 2021, the Applicant\u2019s Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant. A copy of the said letter is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK 1.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2014 As state, councils share N137m Land Use Charges\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nThe Federal Government has ranked Ondo state first in its rating of the 36 states of the Federation in Public Sector Accounting Procedures.\n\nThis was contained in the current report on the Monitoring and Evaluation of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) Implementation released by the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning.\n\nA release by the Ondo state commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo said that the report has already been sent to the World Bank in readiness for yet-to-be-specified funds as a grant to Ondo.\n\nOjogo said that \u201cMr Governor has already been briefed in writing by the State Auditor General for Local Governments via a letter dated June 24, 2021. Interestingly, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning had since sent it to the World Bank in readiness for the grant.\n\n\u201cIt is a very commendable development that attests to government\u2019s transparency\u201d, he said.\n\nThe report, titled: \u201cReport On The Monitoring And Evaluation Of The Level Of Implementation Of IPSAS Accrual Basis Of Accounting By Public Sector Entities(PSEs) In Nigeria\u201d covers the 774 local governments across the states as well as the Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe survey and rating exercise was undertaken by a team from the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning late last year with a focus on the following areas: the constitution of IPSAS implementation committee as approved in the governance structure, training of officers on an accrual basis of accounting and setting up of stock-taking team in line with the National Treasury Circular issued in 2015.\n\nOthers include identification and documentation of PPE and liabilities, domestication of the National chart of accounts for accounting and budgeting processes, the commencement of IPSAS accrual basis by the PSEs effective from 1st of January, 2016 and; preparation and presentation of accrual-based GPFS.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ondo State government has shared a total of N137 million revenue which accrued from the Land Use charges as well as Radio and Television license in the last six months to the 18 council areas of the state.\n\nEach of the local governments got N2.250 million after the money was shared while the state government got N94 million.\n\nChairman of Ondo State Internal Revenue Service, Tolu Adegbie said generated through the land use charge, courtesy of the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAdegbie said that \u201cWe shared about N100 million in 2019, and we shared about N200 million in 2020 and a half 2020, we shared another formula then was that the local governments will get 20 per cent while the state government gets 80 per cent but last year, Mr Governor graciously approved the increase in the local governments share to 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cSo we implemented it in December last year\u201d. Since we started this year, from January to June, we have collected N137 million and local government is getting N40 million while the state government is getting N94 million and off course ODIRS is getting 2.5 million\u201d.\n\nThe chairman noted that the biggest collection came from Akure South Local Government, stressing that most of the civil servants reside in the state capital.\n\nAdegbie noted that the money belongs to the local governments and the state and all the 18 local governments have met and decided to share the money on the basis of equality.\n\n\u201cAlso we are in partnership with the local governments in other areas notably in the area of Radio and TV collection and from December 2020-June 2021, we have generated N16 million and for taxi and bus ticket sales, we shared N13 million.\n\n\u201cIt means that between January and June 2021, ODIRS has been able to generate N69.6 million for the local governments in the state which some has been shared.\n\n\u201cWhat led to the increase is all about more awareness. A lot of people are now aware of land use and they\u2019ve seen that the money is not much and they are willingly coming to pay and most people are paying for three to four years.\n\n\u201cIf all the civil servants alone can pay, our income would have been far better than this.\n\nHe added that \u201cThere are sanctions in the 2014 land use charge for those who fail to pay the land use charge but it is not economically viable to go to court for land use charge of N20,000.\n\nAdegbie said that \u201d the cost of consulting a lawyer, going to court every day and other things, so it is better for people to pay willingly and we charge them to do so because this is not supposed to be a punitive thing.\u201d",

FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came upon 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\n\u201cThat the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO.

There was no break-in, no molestation and no violence of any kind during the operation.\u201d\n\nUwujaren regretted that a section of the media presented a narrative of Gestapo operation, with a forceful break-in and the violation of the privacy of nude guests.\n\nHe said reports against the EFCC quoted the hotel owner and his manager as refusing to speak about what transpired.\n\n\u201cBut the claim is obviously a game of ostrich as their involvement in pushing out the false narrative is discernable.\n\n\u201cThe hotel owner perhaps is ignorant of the fact that he could become an accomplice and liable for allowing his premises to be used for cybercrime, in contravention of section 3 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act.\u201d\n\nEFCC further warned hoteliers from allowing their premises and facilities to become havens for cybercrime.",

We thought we had fine very far, not until we noticed that the Land Use Contraventions have been very high and disturbing.\n\n\u201cSo we had to come back here today (Wednesday) to continue the cleanup. Thanks directors of Development Control and Security who out heads together for us to get four to five machines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSome of the illegalities of land contravention include buying land from local Chiefs, building without building plan approvals, building substandard structures and the authorities will not allow these to continue because the city is planned and when we see contravention, it is the mandate of the FCTA to take it out\u201d.\n\nAsked whether there was any compensation for them, Attah said: \u201cThey have been warned before and when you commit illegality\u2026..we even ought to take them to court but we are leaving them. The Chiefs who gave them the land have denied that they gave them land\u201d.\n\nAttah also sent a warning to owners of illegal structures within Mpape, Dutse Makaranta, Ushafa and areas to either move out or comply, adding they were next in line for similar clean up exercises.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to rush this work now because the people of Mpape, Dutse Makaranta and Ushafa -both the residents and landlords are begging the FCT Minister to come and clean up their area, so we will soon be going to assist them.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing encroachments even in the Lower Usuma Dam where we get our safe water to drink.

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says 542,576 Nigerians have completed online voter registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed the determination of the commission to deepen democracy through the use of technology.\n\nHe also put the number of Nigerians who have completed online voters\u2019 pre-registration at 542,576.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the resident electoral commissioners, said: \u201cI would like to reassure Nigerians that the commission will continue to spare no effort in deepening the use of technology to ensure electoral transparency and credibility.\u201d\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the clamour for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, amidst efforts by the leadership of the National Assembly to delete the provision from the bill.\n\nYakubu said the voters\u2019 register remained at the heart of any credible election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that just as we had a smooth take-off of the online pre-registration, the commencement of the physical registration will similarly be hitch-free.\u201d\n\nHe said the first quarter of the physical registration would commence between June 28 and September 30, while the second quarter of the exercise will start October 4 to December 30.\n\nAlso, the third quarter of the physical registration will start from January 3, 2022, to April 1, 2022, and the fourth quarter will kick off on April 11 to June 30, 2022.\n\nGiving update of the exercise, Yakubu said two weeks since the exercise began, a total of 542,576 Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration.\n\nAccording to him, out of this figure, 456,909 are fresh registrants while 85,667 have applied for voter transfer, replacement of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and update of voter information record among others.\n\nHe added that the commission is able to provide Nigerians with information on the distribution of registrants across the states and by age, occupation, gender and disability.\n\n\u201cOut of 542,576 online registrants so far, 356,777 (or 66 per cent) are young people between the ages of 18 and 34 years.\n\n\u201cThis is followed by 134,719 middle-aged registrants who fall between 35 and 49 years. The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nA total of 222 people have been killed while 774 others have been kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna state in the past three months.\n\nThis was contained in the second quarter security report, presented to Governor Nasir El-Rufai by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan on Tuesday at the Government House Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the report covers the period between April 1 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe report showed a slide reduction in the number of deaths and the number of people abducted.\n\nIn the first quarter report, present in April, a total of 323 persons were killed while 949 others were kidnapped by bandits across Kaduna State.\n\nAruwan also disclosed that a total of 8,553 heads of cattle were rustled in the period under review with most stolen from the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, which accounted for around\n\n5,715 stolen cattle.\n\nAruwan said the 222 deaths were caused by banditry attacks, communal clashes and reprisals across the state.\n\nAccording to him, 159 of the deaths, were recorded in Kaduna Central Senatorial District while Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and Northern Senatorial District recorded 54 and nine deaths respectively.\n\nThe commissioner said of the 774 people kidnapped, Kaduna Central Senatorial\n\nDistrict topped the list with 555 people abducted.\n\nBirnin Gwari, Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa and Igabi LGAs, where there are rampant cases of killings and kidnappings are in the Kaduna Central senatorial zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 164 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 111.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 55 kidnapped persons, with 37 of these from Zaria LGA.\n\n\u201cIn total, 239 women, and 32 minors were kidnapped in the second quarter across the state\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 20 persons were reported to have been raped across the state during the period, adding that a total of 266 were injured as a result of banditry, violent attacks, reprisals and communal clashes.\n\nAruwan also raised the alarm over looming food insecurity, threat to education and attack on health facilities in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cBanditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state.\n\n\u201cBandits attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their fields. Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nPresident Buhari declared, \u201cwe are a lucky country and should congratulate ourselves, despite challenges that could have torn us apart.\u201d\n\nHe urged leaders to respect the people, from the lowest to the highest, \u201cso that it becomes a duty to them (the people) to pay back to the leadership.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, repect for the people should come in allowing them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nDescribing the event as \u201ca remarkable occasion,\u201d President Buhari restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 States during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the Ninth National Assembly for its cooperation with the Executive, the President said he tried very hard to get the Eighth Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much, but time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the very beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by the lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit, \u201cand Mr President was very eager and enthusiastic about it, showing the importance you place on security.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that will be implemented by the Executive.\n\n\u201cThank you Mr President for what you have done so far to douse tension and for Nigeria to remain one.

          "text": "A group, American Veterans of Igbo Descent (AVID), has written a letter to Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta to find a means of facilitating the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAVID expressed its displeasure with Kenyatta for abducting Kanu and extraditing him to the Nigerian government for seeking liberation for his Igbo people.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta with Buhari\n\nThe group, which comprises Igbo men and women that are serving or served in different security agencies in the United States, told the Kenyan leader that a Nigerian former President, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe saved his father, Jomo Kenyatta who was involved in similar agitation, from the same fate he was to suffer in the hands of British authorities.\n\nThey berated the leader of the East African nation for betraying Kanu, by handing him over to the enemies that want to prosecute him for defending his people.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Government Asked Us To Abduct You \u2013 Kenya Operatives Told Nnamdi Kanu, Chained Him To Floor For Six Days\n\nAVID said this in a letter signed by its President, Chief Sylvester Onyia, dated July 10, 2021, which was made available to SaharaReporters.\n\nRead the full letter below:\n\nThe American Veterans of Igbo Descent (AVID) just received an urgent Intel we need to explore with you bordering on the kidnap/abduction of a political activist globally known as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu \u2013 a Biafra/British citizen within your country.\n\nAVID is comprised of Igbo ethnic men and women who honorably served or are currently serving in different Armed branches of the United States Military. Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, a veteran is defined as a \u201cperson who served in the Active Military, Naval, or Air Service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.\n\nVeteran members of AVID are citizens from all the 50 states in the United States, born as Igbo men and women; and successfully served in the following United States Military Branches:\n\n1. The United States Army\n\n2. The United States Marine Corp\n\n3. The United States Navy SEAL \u2013 Sea, Air, and Land specialists.\n\n4. The United States Navy\n\n5. The United States Airforce\n\n6.

The United States Army Guard, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve\n\n11. The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u201d\n\nThe organization further revealed in the letter how the agitation for Biafra began a few years after Nigerian Independence and what has transpired till now.\n\nIt also informed Kenyatta of how the Nigerian government sent its security agents to invade Kanu\u2019s house in which people were killed in 2017, but the IPOB leader escaped.\n\nThe nation called Nigeria has never known peace since the amalgamation of the north and south by the British in 1914. You might be aware of the historic Biafran war which lasted from 1967-1970.\n\nThe war was a quest for self-determination of the Igbo people-an attempted emancipation from Fulani terrorist Muslims. Statistically, 2.5 plus million Igbo children, women, and defenseless men perished in that genocide.\n\nBecause of the gruesome rape of young Igbo girls and married women, unprovoked killings, land grabbing, massacre, maiming by the Fulani men with no accountability, Eastern Nigeria men pillaged, slaughtered en mass within their indigenous ancestral land with no consequences and grand plan by Nigeria Fulani Islamic-led Jihadist government to violently eliminate all Igbo Judeo-Christian ethnic people and repopulate our ancestral land with Fulani Muslims.\n\nNigeria government despicable act of support for Boko haram terrorists and Miyetti Allah Muslim Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN. This association is the leadership of Fulani terrorists\u2019 groups disguising as cattle herders in Nigeria.\n\nA credible Civil Rights Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (MNK) established the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and a security outfit called Eastern Security Network (ESN) to protect our people.\n\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu has been a target for assassination by the Nigerian Government. There has been the deployment of the Army to his home to kill him an operation (coded operation python dance.) His home was riddled with bullets, 25 young men were killed, but he miraculously escaped.\n\nWe are therefore upset and saddened by your collusion with Nigerian Terrorist Government to abduct/kidnap an unarmed son and a Liberation Political Activist (LPA) whom you should have protected and celebrated in support of democracy and freedom,\u201d the letter continued.\n\nThe group went further to compare the fate of older Kenyatta whom Azikwe saved and how younger Kenyatta decided to hand over Kanu to his enemy.\n\nHistorical Underpinning:\n\nA historical journey through memory lane shows that your father President Jomo Kenyatta was found guilty to be hanged by Britain because of his freedom agitation; same as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you betrayed.\n\nDr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the premier of Eastern Nigeria, used money from the Eastern regional government, hired local and international lawyers, came to Nairobi Kenya, and pulled out the head of Jomo Kenyatta from the British hangman\u2019s noose. There is a street and market named in honor of your father in Igbo land.\n\nYour father was accused of leading a terrorist organization called Mau-Mau just as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you betrayed. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe delivered your father from death by hanging, and you delivered Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to be killed by a terrorist Nigerian Government. Ironically, your name \u201cUhuru\u201d means Freedom, but you stand against Freedom by your betrayal of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nDo you not know that this Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you extradited to the Nigerian hangman is related to Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe who delivered your father from a British hangman?\u201d The letter further said.\n\nWhile closing, the group ordered the Kenyan President to find to correct his anomalies by making sure the pro-Biafra secessionist leader regain his freedom.American Veterans of Igbo Descent Understanding:\n\nYour government kidnapped a foreign Civil Political Agitator Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (MNK) and handed him over to the Terrorist Nigeria Government who embraces internationally recognized terrorist organization known as Boko Haram.\n\nYour violent abduction and extradition of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu endangered his life for political views he shares with your late father. Your action tantamount to Ad ignorantum because you quickly forgot the help your father received from Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (brother of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu), and without that help, you may not have been born.\n\nYour government hostile and violent action of MNK\u2019s seizure and abduction within your territory is a slap on the face of all Igbo Ethnic Nationality. MNK\u2019s abduction by your security agents has affirmed the consequence, which violates MNK\u2019s United Nations stipulated Human Rights. How can you justify your dastardly action of kidnap and extraditing MNK to the Nigeria terrorist Fulani Muslim Cabal leadership?\n\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu did not violate any known Kenya law or international law. You must as a matter of urgency ameliorate this degraded condition within a reasonable time and call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThank you in advance for your esteemed response, consideration, and attention to this matter.\n\nGod bless you and God bless the Kenyan people.",
          "summary": "Veteran members of AVID are citizens from all the 50 states in the United States, born as Igbo men and women; and successfully served in the following United States Military Branches:1.\nDr. Nnamdi Azikiwe delivered your father from death by hanging, and you delivered Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to be killed by a terrorist Nigerian Government.\nIronically, your name \u201cUhuru\u201d means Freedom, but you stand against Freedom by your betrayal of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\nYour violent abduction and extradition of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu endangered his life for political views he shares with your late father.\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu did not violate any known Kenya law or international law.",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks.

          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new appointment\n\nVerifyMe\u2019s VeriFind launch\n\nMobile app downloads skyrocket\n\nFlutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer, Oluwabankole Falade. Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

Federation Account for the period of January to December, 2015.\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber called on the Corporation to desist from further deduction at source as this contravenes Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nIt also mandated the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) or any other approving authority to, as a matter of urgency, approve agreed percentage which should be allocated to NNPC monthly as operational cost to ensure that their operations are not adversely affected.\n\nThese formed part of the 59 recommendations adopted by the Senate and contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the annual report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Accounts of the Federation for the years ended 31st December, 2015.\n\nThe Senate in one of its adopted recommendations to the Executive arm of government noted that the outstanding collection from Solid Minerals (N12,137,140,361.58) not remitted to the Federation Account, but kept in an account maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria contravenes the provisions of Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe chamber, therefore, charged the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) to fix a percentage to be allocated to Mining and Cadastral Office as cost of collection as is currently applicable to NCS (7 percent), DPR (4 percent) and FIRS (4 percent) of non-oil revenue.\n\nOn Unretired Advances involving 39 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the tune of N2,296,567,084.37 billion, the upper chamber demanded the sanctioning of Accounting Officers of MDAs in accordance with the provision of Rule 3124 of Financial Regulations.\n\nIt also call gave the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed

the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to set in motion the process of recovery of Internal Loans made from other Funds which stands at N390,288,085,668.92 billion and to be paid back into the Special Funds Accounts.\n\nNNPC: Kyari\u2019s 2 Years In The Saddle\n\nThe source of the loans are from the Development of Natural Resources Account, Stabilization Fund Account, 25 percent Husked Brown Rice Levy, 1 percent Comprehensive Supervision Scheme (CISS) Pool Levy, 15 percent Wheat Grain Levy, and 10 percent Rice Levy.\n\nIn another vein, the upper chamber directed the

non-remittance of another N67,508,041,250.00 for 2013 and 2014 into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), being 25 percent of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nIt further noted that the failure to remit capitalized interest to the Consolidated Revenue Fund totaling N99,712,464.24 between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn financial infractions by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Senate called for the sanction of the Permanent Secretary in accordance with Rule 3129 of the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules 030402 over the diversion of N23,642,000.00 from the Capital Projects Funds for purchase of Sallah/Christians welfare package to staff of the Ministry.\n\nThe upper chamber queried the sums of N46,645,000.00 and N56,418,135.00 for the printing of the Ministry\u2019s letter-headed paper, and demanded that the sum be recovered and paid back to the treasury.\n\nIt also called for the identification of the Project Accountant who authorized the diversion of N32,783,052.00 meant for IPPIS training and other programmes to bank accounts of staff of Finance and Accounts Department, instead of paying the approved amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nThe Senate demanded the refund of the amount to government coffers, including the sum of N718,911,848.00 made in the cashbook as payments to eleven corporate bodies without documentation.\n\nIn addition, the chamber called on the Ministry to identify and present for disciplinary action, the officers behind the authorization of N98,400,000.00 in favour of a company for printing of leaflets for the Petroleum Industry Bill awareness campaign Programme; N54,000,000.00 to a company for assessment and documentation of Oil Spill sites in ten (10) states of the Niger Delta; and N25,000,000.00 for actualizing e-governance procedure.\n\nThe infractions, the Senate noted, were in violation of Rule 3117.\n\nThe Senate called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to prosecute within 30 days, the Officers in the Ministry of Youths and Sports (National Sports Commission) who certified the payment of N37,185,000.00 from the Capital Vote allocation.\n\nIt also directed that N2,695,985.00 be recovered from the emolument of the Director-General of the Small Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), who authorized that the sum be paid to individuals instead of a company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, also demanded the prosecution of the Accounting Officer with SMEDAN who approved the sum of N38,038,238.14 without relevant and supporting documents in contravention to extant laws.\n\nIn meting further disciplinary actions, the chamber called on the EFCC to prosecute within thirty days, officers of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (NBET) who were behind the non-remittance of accrued interest on investment in Nigeria Treasury

The Senate should be quite correct if it pegs the age of the candidates at 16 years. If you talk of gifted children, how many are they in a class? Whoever must have argued for it must be an expert in sociology and psychology.\n\n\u201cIt is not ideal for any child to go and take the UTME or school certificate exam under 16 years. Even those in the university are just there to satisfy their parents. It is not encouraging. It pains me when I see a child not up to one year and they are already taking her to school. It is wrong; the child should first be educated at home.\n\n\u201cWhen you rush a child too early, the child rushes out too early without learning. Parents should dedicate more time to their children. If a child enters school at eight years, you will notice that he/she will be more mature than his/her other mates, who may be six or seven years old in the same class.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, the President, ANCOPSS, Mr Anselm Izuagie, maintained that there should be no age limit to education.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary; anybody can pick up at any time; so, you deny them the opportunity of entering into the university because not everyone will complete secondary school at the age of 16 years. People pick up educationally at different times, as such, there should be no age limit to education,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, President, NPTAN, Mr Haruna Danjuma, said writing the UTME at an early age would be of no benefit to students.\n\n\u201cIf the government says a minimum of 16 years is okay, there is nothing wrong with that. They should stick to it because allowing a child to write the UTME at an early age will not be of benefit to the child. Government should also improve on education and provide everything the students need to perform well,\u201d he stated. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Whoever must have argued for it must be an expert in sociology and psychology.\n\n\u201cIt is not ideal for any child to go and take the UTME or school certificate exam under 16 years. Even those in the university are just there to satisfy their parents. It is not encouraging. It pains me when I see a child not up to one year and they are already taking her to school. It is wrong; the child should first be educated at home.\n\n\u201cWhen you rush a child too early, the child rushes out too early without learning. Parents should dedicate more time to their children. If a child enters school at eight years, you will notice that he/she will be more mature than his/her other mates, who may be six or seven years old in the same class.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, the President, ANCOPSS, Mr Anselm Izuagie, maintained that there should be no age limit to education.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary; anybody can pick up at any time; so, you deny them the opportunity of entering into the university because not everyone will complete secondary school at the age of 16 years. People pick up educationally at different times, as such, there should be no age limit to education,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, President, NPTAN, Mr Haruna Danjuma, said writing the UTME at an early age would be of no benefit to students.\n\n\u201cIf the government says a minimum of 16 years is okay, there is nothing wrong with that. They should stick to it because allowing a child to write the UTME at an early age will not be of benefit to the child. Government should also improve on education and provide everything the students need to perform well,\u201d he stated. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

We talk when it\u2019s necessary. The Biafra agitation is something the Lord revealed to me many years ago, 26 if not 27 years ago.

In my wedding ceremony, the chairman of the wedding was Dr Edmund Ezirim, the owner of Blessing Clinic, 97 or 95 Port Harcourt Road, Aba.\n\n\u201cIt was there that the Lord revealed to me the crowd heading to Umuahia. When I asked what kind of crowd is this? Then the Lord told me that was Biafra restoration. I saw the Biafra flag. And God vividly opened and told me that the man that would bring Biafra would come from Umuahia. That was 4th September 1994. The Lord told me Biafra would not come through Nwazuruike.\n\n\u201cSo, later Nnamdi Kanu now came up with Biafra agitation and the Lord told me vividly told me that Biafra would come through him.\n\nHe added that the activities of Nnamdi Kanu and his group were exactly what God revealed to him on 4th September 1994, \u201cThat day was on Sunday. And it rained heavily that day,\u201d he said.\n\nChineme said for this reason he never joined in any prayer for the actualization of Biafra because he knows that God had already revealed to him and the words of the Lord must surely come to pass whether people pray or not.\n\n\u201cThis is what Nnamdi Kanu was born for. God sent him into this planet earth for that purpose. So, whether by prayer or not by prayer, it must surely come to pass,\u201d he added.",

Many cases that were recorded have been unravelled while many suspects arrested have been prosecuted. Isolated cases of robbery in traffic have also been tackled.\n\n\u201cThe perennial gridlock in the city is attributable to numerous road rehabilitations that are simultaneously going on in almost all parts of the city.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this on robbery in traffic is being adequately taken care of by the command The tactical teams and other science-based units of the Command have put their resources together to reduce these menaces to their barest minimum in Lagos State, since no society is absolutely free of crimes,\u201d he said.\n\nOdumosu added that due to the general appraisal of security of the state and robust intelligence gathering, the Command has embarked on constant raid of flash points, where miscreants who terrorise innocent people of Lagos State, especially attacking them in traffic, hibernate across the state.\n\nAccording to him, the idea was to be proactive and take the fight against crimes and criminality to their dens, disclosing that the Command, is parading 1,320 miscreants/hoodlums who were raided at various locations across the state and that many dangerous weapons, suspected hard drugs and weeds suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered from them.\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to reiterate its determination and commitment to harness all available means of reducing crimes and social vices in Lagos State as required of the Police,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) and director of Radio Biafra, has sued the Nigerian government over his ongoing confinement at the Department of State Services\u2019 national headquarters.\n\nThe IPOB leader was apprehended in Kenya in June and extradited to Nigeria on treason charges.\n\nHe was then charged and taken before Binta Nyako, a Federal High Court judge in Abuja, who requested that he be remanded in the DSS custody.\n\nIn reaction to his agitation for the Republic of Biafra, Kanu is facing accusations bordering on treasonable felony brought against him in court.\n\nIn April 2017, he was granted release on medical grounds, although he failed to comply with some of the court\u2019s terms.\n\nHowever, in a suit filed in Abuja\u2019s Federal High Court by his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the IPOB leader prayed for a court order \u201cdirecting the transfer of the Applicant from the custody of the National Headquarters of the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before the commencement of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before the\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable Court requiring the Defendant/custodian Applicant\u2019s to provide access to his medical experts/doctors to conduct out a full independent medical evaluation of the defendant/health applicant\u2019s condition/status, while in custody,\u201d his lawyer added.\n\nKanu further stated that if his health problem is not addressed quickly, he may die.\n\nRead the text of the charges below:\n\n\u201cThat this charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came up on 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\n\u201cThat the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO. FCH/ABJ/CR/383/2015 on that 29th June 2021.\n\n\u201cThat on 30th June 2021, the Applicant\u2019s Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant. A copy of the said letter is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK 1. That on 2nd July 2021, at about 12:32pm, the State Security Service called me to inform me that our request to visit the Applicant has been approved and that I should come by 4:00 pm to see Defendant.\n\n\u201cThat on the said 2nd July 2021 at about 5:00pm, at the State Security Headquarters, in Abuja, the Applicant informed me of the following facts which I verily believed to be accurate and correct as follows; That he was kidnapped and/or abducted by Kenyan Security Forces on 19th June 2021, specifically at Nairobi Airport.\n\n\u201cThat he was detained by the personnel of the Kenyan Police Force for eight days, and was throughout this period of detention subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment, brutal torture, causing grave and severe heart problem that almost took his life. That he was detained in an unconventional facility, not necessarily a police detention center in Kenya.\n\n\u201cThat throughout this detention in Kenya, he was never allowed access to his relatives before he was handed over to their Nigerian Security counterparts who smuggled him into Nigeria in clear violation of his rights. That since he was smuggled into this country on 27th June 2021, he has been kept in solitary confinement without access to his family members, relatives, wife, cousins, and children, except his lawyer, who only visits after they must secure the approval and endorsement of the Director-General of the State Security Service, which approval are not usually granted as a matter of course.\n\n\u201cThat he is still being subjected to mental and psychological torture by his custodians, on account of the conditions of his solitary confinement. That an ECG examination was carried out on the Defendant, and it was discovered that the Defendant\u2019s heart had been enlarged by more than 13%, posing a serious threat and danger to Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat there is a need for the Defendant to have access to his Medical Doctors to avert the danger looming against the life of the Defendant. That the health personnel attending to the Defendant in the custody of the State Security Service is not adequate considering the circumstances of the Defendant\u2019s health condition.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant requires the services of his medical experts as his medical records issued by the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital who has the Defendant\u2019s medical records, mainly, before the arrest/abduction of the Applicant shows a debilitating medical condition. Copies of these medical records showing the Applicant\u2019s subsisting health condition are hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK.\n\n\u201cThat if the health condition of the Defendant is not addressed most promptly, the Defendant may die in custody, even before his trial. It is essential that the Defendant\u2019s Medical Experts/Consultants be allowed to carry out proper, thorough, and independent medical examinations of the Defendant to save the Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant needs regular medical observation/attention by the Defendant\u2019s Medical specialists/Consultants in Cardiology. That the Defendant\u2019s Medical Specialists (including the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital) in Kenya have his complete medical records that will easily aid the examination of the Defendant and treatment thereof.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant undertakes to bear any cost incidental to getting the medical experts to attend to his ill health while in custody. The defendant can only be alive to stand his trial, which cannot be guaranteed because of his rapidly deteriorating health situation.\n\n\u201cThe Defendant cannot effectively put up a defense to the charge against him, in his present deteriorating health condition. That I know that upon the arraignment of the Applicant, this Honourable Court in its wisdom initially remanded the Applicant in Kuje Correctional Service Centre, where he was held for almost two years before bail was consequently granted to the Applicant.\n\n\u201cThat for the almost two years the Applicant was in custody in Kuje Correctional Facility, there was never any complaint about any form of misconduct against him. That the State Security Service is not a detention Centre, neither does it have the requisite custodial facilities to enhance the conditions of the occupants/inmates.\n\n\u201cThat the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre is an impartial facility that has no interest whatsoever in the outcome of this charge. That the Nigerian Correctional Service Center is the only body statutorily empowered to keep custody of persons facing criminal trial in courts, hence, the necessity to transfer the Applicant to the Nigerian Correctional Service Center Kuje.\n\n\u201cThat it will serve the interest of Justice and enhance fair hearing for this Honourable Court to transfer the Applicant from the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat the Applicant has very limited access to his lawyers, who can only visit him after the approval of the Director of the State Security Services has been first sought and obtained, which said approval in most cases, takes days and that the above situation would greatly impede the Defendant\u2019s preparation for his defense to the charge against him.\n\n\u201cThat the favorable consideration of this application is compelling in the circumstance of the present Notice for the resumption of the Court\u2019s Annual vacation, which would affect the hearing on the substantive charge already slated for the 26th Day of July 2021. That fair hearing can only be guaranteed when the Applicant is not remanded in the custody of his accusers.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. That it will greatly aid and serve the interest of Justice if this application is granted. That the respondent will not be prejudiced by the grant of this application. That I depose to this affidavit in good faith believing same to be true and correct and in accordance with the oath Act.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.",
          "summary": "\u201cThat on 30th June 2021, the Applicant\u2019s Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant.\nThat the health personnel attending to the Defendant in the custody of the State Security Service is not adequate considering the circumstances of the Defendant\u2019s health condition.\n\u201cThat if the health condition of the Defendant is not addressed most promptly, the Defendant may die in custody, even before his trial.\n\u201cThat the Defendant needs regular medical observation/attention by the Defendant\u2019s Medical specialists/Consultants in Cardiology.\nThat the State Security Service is not a detention Centre, neither does it have the requisite custodial facilities to enhance the conditions of the occupants/inmates.",

According to him, such can only happen if those killed were staying with the bandits in the forest. The spokesman stated the airstrikes were done in Sububu forest and nowhere close to any village and asked why such charges will surface.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Gabkwet remarked;\n\n\u201cGood morning all. I feel its important I address this report. I just got off the phone with Alhaji Mohammad Ibrahim, the Director of Security, Ministry of Internal Security, Zamfara State who confirmed the happiness of the State Government over the precise nature of the strike by NAF jet.\n\nI am also aware that the State Governor has called our Commanders on ground to commend the NAF.\n\nA local contractor in the general area also confirmed the attack and its devastating effect on the bandits. Till now, the remnants of the bandits are evacuating and departing from the Sububu Forest general area.\n\nNow, the strike was in Sububu Forest and not anywhere close to any village. So stories of NAF hitting any target outside the Forest is false. Secondly, on the issue of accidental kills, I find it hard to believe except if those accidentally killed were residing in the forest. I can only continue to probe further.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian political arena is currently agog with declarations and bids of many political heavyweights to succeed the incumbent President Mohammadu Buhari who will step aside in 2023 after his mandatory eight years in office. While some of the candidates are operating lip service structures, His Excellency Owelle Rochas Ethelbert Anayo Okorocha, a distinguished senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, already has a formidable structure that is making a strong impact in the six geo-political zones.\n\nThat is why his office, the Nigerian Unity House, is currently besieged by multifarious groups to endorse the presidential ambition of the Ogboko born charismatic politician. For the past two months, the unity house has become one of the busiest centers in Abuja with courtesy calls from not less than 1000 different groups from Owelle\u2019s beloved North West, North East, North Central, South West, South-South, and his indigenous South East.\n\nAll the various groups came with one swan- song, that Owelle stands the best chance to emerge victorious in 2023and extend his RESCUE MISSION mantra to Nigeria. In fact, one of the enthusiastic groups, the Nigerian Youths Alternative Council threatened to initiate litigations against Owelle if he does do not respond to their clarion call to officially declare for the presidency. Moreover, the mothers and other female groups were not left out. Recently, the Omalicha Umuadalgbo worldwide equally visited to extol his good dreams for New Nigeria that will actualize the gender balance for marginalized female folks.\n\nAs charity begins at home, his kinsmen from Umuma Ebemmano clan made up of 14 large communities in ldeato south LGA Imo state stormed the unity house to endorse and encourage the pride of their clan that the coast is clear for him to emerge as next president of Nigeria in 2023. During the courtesy call, their leader, Engr Jude Anayo Ibe thanked Owelle for his dynamic leadership and rescue mission in lmo state. Another respected royal father and elder from the community.\n\nHRH Ichie Uche Chineke. Chairman Eze lgbo Traditional Council FCTnot only prayed for God\u2019s grace to Owelle but crowned the courtesy visit with the presentation of a unique Igbosymbolicwalking stickof authoritythat will banish all unforeseen ugly forces that might stand as the Rock of Gibraltar against Owelle\u2019s march to Aso rock. The community women leader, Lolo Charity Ego Duru assured that their prayers will send a legion of Anges to protect and lead Owelle to the promised land. The question remains. Why are so many groups from the Nigerian six geo-political zones drumming support for Owelle Rochas? The answer lies simply in his detribalized credentials, religious piety, transparency, and philanthropism which have transformed the wellbeing of people in all parts of Nigeria.\n\nIn fact, there is no Nigerian geo-political zone that has not benefited from Rochas Foundation Colleges and multifarious investments in the 36 states of the federation. As messianic Governor of Imo state, his 8 years rescue mission moved the heartland state to the next level via ecumenical center, 27 standard hospitals, new government house, free education, school buildings in all the wards, universities, cargo airport, stadiums, palm revolution, best judicial infrastructure, community watch, civil guard and intra city road networks. Just like many Imo communities, his beloved Umuma Ebemmano clan was equally turned into a mini-city with universities, road networks, widows houses, youth vehicles, hospitals, modern schools, boreholes, etc.\n\nToday, with the numerous visitations and endorsement from Nigerians at his unity house, the coast is clear for Owelle to emerge as Nigerian President in 2023. His wealth of experience and leadership acumen in the political, religious academic, cultural, economic, and social realm will not only put the nation on strong footing but lead to the actualization of New Nigerian manifest destiny as a true giant of Africa and leader of the black world.\n\nLong live Excellency Owelle Rochas Ehelbert Anayo Okorocha, Nigerian detribalized servant leader with the Midas touch to take Nigeria to the NEXT level as President in 2023.\n\n\u2026 Chief Duruis is an Abuja based political analyst and policy advocate",

Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila debunked the insinuation by calling on the agitated groups to lobby their lawmakers but in plenary yesterday, Lawan described the allegations of manipulating the contents of the bill as the work of mischief-maker\u2019s bent on blackmailing the leadership of the National Assembly.\n\nRefutal of the insinuation came to the fore after the chairman of Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC Kano South) laid the report for consideration.\n\nThe Senate President, therefore, advised Nigerians to lobby lawmakers on any aspect of the bill they feel strongly about, insisting that the National Assembly would do only what is right when it eventually considers the bill.\n\nHe disclosed that the attempt by some elements to blackmail the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives resulted in the publication of his phone number and the Speaker\u2019s on various online platforms.\n\nAccording to him, his privacy was invaded with over 900 messages accusing him of manipulating the contents of the bill.\n\nThe Senate President, however, maintained that the National Assembly can only consider aspects of the amendment bill contained in the Committee\u2019s report presented to the upper chamber for consideration.\n\nLawan said, \u201cThere are various accusations, insinuations that the leadership of the Senate, sometimes the leadership of the National Assembly have tampered with the report of the committee on INEC of both chambers.\n\n\u201cSome of those accusing the leadership of the National Assembly are innocently misinformed, some are simply mischievous and rabble rousers.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time this report is laid here. This is the decision of the committee on INEC and, therefore, whatever will be discussed or considered about the Electoral Act Amendment Bill will be on the basis of what has been presented to the Senate here.\n\n\u201cIf anybody feels very strongly about anything, lobby distinguished Senators to canvass for your position, rather than blackmail our leadership, because my telephone line and that of the Honourable Speaker were published.

          "text": "When two comedians started a podcast about Britney Spears\u2019s quirky Instagram posts, they had no idea it would fuel a global online movement uniting superfans with rights activists in outrage over the star\u2019s legal situation.\n\nBritney\u2019s Gram began in 2017 as a lighthearted podcast in which hosts Tess Barker and Babs Gray dissected the eccentric mix of memes, selfies and dance videos posted on the singer\u2019s account.\n\nBut the pair grew increasingly intrigued \u2014 and concerned \u2014 by the legal conservatorship that Spears had been under since 2008. The arrangement gave the popstar\u2019s father widespread control over her finances and personal life, while forcing her to pay lawyers hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees.\n\n\u201cThe podcast organically started to transform into more of an investigative podcast,\u201d Barker said, ahead of the latest court hearing over Spears\u2019s conservatorship in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nThe comedians spent hours sifting through court documents, hoping to understand whether the arrangement was really working as intended: protecting 39-year-old Spears, who had suffered a high-profile breakdown in the mid-2000s under the intense glare of the paparazzi.\n\nOther fans-turned-sleuths began obsessively combing the singer\u2019s cryptic, emoji-laden posts for clues about her well-being. Increasingly they worried that she had been \u201csilenced\u201d under the conservatorship, unable to speak out about how unhappy she really was.\n\nIn 2019, when Spears\u2019s Instagram had been mysteriously inactive for weeks, an audio message from a key source landed in the podcast\u2019s inbox. The caller, who identified himself as a former paralegal, alleged that Spears had been forced into a mental health facility months earlier.\n\n\u201cYou guys are onto something,\u201d he told Barker and Gray. \u201cWhat is happening is disturbing to say the least.\u201d\n\nThe message, which aired in a viral episode of the podcast titled \u201c#FreeBritney\u201d, sent shockwaves through Spears\u2019s fanbase \u2014 but it would also gain the attention of campaigners with no interest in gyrating dance moves or hits like \u201cBaby One More Time\u201d.\n\n\u2013 The power of online fandom \u2013\n\nHundreds of thousands of online posts have been tagged #FreeBritney \u2014 half a million tweets alone on June 23 when Spears gave bombshell testimony, saying she had been drugged against her will and was not even allowed to control her own contraception.\n\nWhile local fans have staged protests outside the courthouse, the online campaign spans globally, from Britain to the Philippines. A quarter of #FreeBritney tweets are posted from Brazil, according to Twitter analysis tool Hashtagify.\n\n\u201cIn the past people could show up at a courthouse with signs saying \u2018I love you\u2019, but it\u2019s way different if you show up on Twitter. You\u2019ve got a global reach,\u201d said Katherine Larsen, editor of the Journal of Fandom Studies.\n\nShe sees the #FreeBritney movement as part of a growing trend \u201cwhere fans have been able to harness social media and get something done\u201d, pointing to followers of K-pop superband BTS \u2014 who raised $1 million in a day for the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 as another example.\n\nLike many fans, Andrea Corina Lopez felt compelled to join the campaign because she felt a personal connection with Spears, having similarly struggled with her mental health.\n\nShe set up a #FreeBritney YouTube channel from her home in Chile to help Spanish-speakers follow the latest developments \u2014 partly because of the chilling realisation that \u201cwhat is happening to her could happen to someone like me\u201d.\n\nAs the movement has gained steam, disparate groups have joined forces.\n\nDisability and civil rights campaigners say Spears\u2019s case highlights how easily vulnerable people can be abused; lawyers have chipped in to help fans understand the finer points of conservatorship legislation.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who are part of the #FreeBritney movement who don\u2019t even listen to her music,\u201d said Gray, who has just launched a new deep-dive podcast with Barker into the guardianship, \u201cToxic\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Vindication \u2013\n\nFor fans, the fact that Spears\u2019s conservatorship has now captured public attention is vindication of their efforts to raise the alarm \u2014 in some cases, for years.\n\nJordan Miller, who runs the fansite BreatheHeavy, was signing posts \u201cFree Britney\u201d as early as 2009.\n\n\u201cIt took years of writing about it, speaking about it, for the world to see what it felt like I had been seeing for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nFans who saw something sinister in Spears\u2019s legal arrangements were initially met with skepticism. This was not helped by the conspiratorial leanings of some #FreeBritney activists, convinced that each of her Instagram posts was laced with coded messages.\n\nBut all factions of the movement agree on one thing: they\u2019re looking forward to a day when the hashtag can be retired for good.\n\n\u201cA happy ending is Britney Spears just getting to enjoy the same liberties that we think everybody should be able to enjoy,\u201d said Barker.",
          "summary": "But the pair grew increasingly intrigued \u2014 and concerned \u2014 by the legal conservatorship that Spears had been under since 2008.\n\u201cThe podcast organically started to transform into more of an investigative podcast,\u201d Barker said, ahead of the latest court hearing over Spears\u2019s conservatorship in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\nIncreasingly they worried that she had been \u201csilenced\u201d under the conservatorship, unable to speak out about how unhappy she really was.\nWhile local fans have staged protests outside the courthouse, the online campaign spans globally, from Britain to the Philippines.\n\u2013 Vindication \u2013For fans, the fact that Spears\u2019s conservatorship has now captured public attention is vindication of their efforts to raise the alarm \u2014 in some cases, for years.",

          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, with star accepting a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay, ESPN reports.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500 million over four years and that expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1 billion. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on August 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nThe report claims that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi in April that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",
