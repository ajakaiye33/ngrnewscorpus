          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nWomen pregnant with twins must deliver in the hospital under the care and supervision of skilled birth attendants, says an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano State, Dr. Mahmoud Magashi.\n\nAccording to the gynaecologist, the need to have the delivery of twins in a hospital and under the supervision of competent caregivers is to ensure the risks associated with a twin pregnancy and childbirth are effectively managed.\n\nAccording to Dr. Magashi, women pregnant with twins or more babies require more care, noting that twin pregnancy and delivery are high-risk.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, the obstetrician and gynaecologist explained that twin gestation is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage, adding that postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.\n\nThe maternal health expert said, \u201cTwin gestation is a high-risk pregnancy. It is a high-risk pregnancy in the sense that it is associated with so many complications. So, because of that, women that are carrying twin pregnancies should ensure that they start antenatal early and also ensure they deliver in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe delivery of twins has its own risk and the woman is at risk of having a postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n\u201cThough twin gestation is not one of the causes of maternal mortality, it is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage and postpartum is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.\u201d\n\nDr. Magashi, however, assured that the various complications associated with twin gestation could be effectively managed through the combined efforts of skilled birth attendants, stressing that women pregnant with more than one baby require special care and attention.\n\n\u201cShe requires more care because if it is twins, you are talking of two foetuses. So, right from her first trimester, you find out that their early pregnancy symptoms are higher.\n\n\u201cThe symptoms are more severe in a woman carrying multiple pregnancies. So, even the vomiting may be more severe. Also. the risk of having miscarriages is higher in twins than in singleton,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving insight into other risks associated with twin pregnancy, the gynaecologist said, \u201cAs the pregnancy progresses, there will be an increase in special symptoms as she will be complaining about the excessive heaviness of the tummy.\n\n\u201cIf it is twin gestation, she is at risk of anaemia in pregnancy. If the woman has anaemia, the baby may have an intrauterine growth restriction.\n\n\u201cWomen with twin gestation may deliver preterm because they are at risk of that. They are also at risk of placenta previa which predisposes them to antepartum haemorrhage.\n\n\u201cAgain, they are at risk of having premature rupture of the membrane and also at risk of having hypertensive diseases of pregnancy which include severe preeclampsia and eclampsia.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, in 2015, Nigeria\u2019s estimated maternal mortality ratio was over 800 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, with approximately 58,000 maternal deaths during that year.\n\nBut the Demographic and Health Survey of 2018 showed that Nigeria\u2019s latest maternal mortality ratio is 512 per 100,000 live births which experts say is still on the high side.\n\nOn the reasons why women pregnant with twins or more babies are at risk of miscarriage, Dr. Magashi said, \u201cThey are at risk of having chromosomal abnormality \u2013 genetics abnormality. If they have this at the beginning of the pregnancy, there is the tendency that they will miscarry the babies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, there are so many predisposing factors that make women have multiple gestations.\n\nHe said, \u201cAge contributes to multiple gestations, use of ovulation induction medication, assisted reproductive techniques and history of twins in the family,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cautioned that if the complications associated with twin gestation are not well managed, it could lead to the death of the woman.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Victor Umeh and Sen Chris Anyanwu among other Igbo patriots at home and in the diaspora\n\nA statement from the GNC Media Office signed by Collins Steve Ugwu disclosed that the conference is organized as a pan-Nigerian dialogue by the non-partisan \u2018Nzuko Umunna\u2019, a global Igbo Think-Tank.\n\n\u201cIt is dedicated towards awakening the best ethnic and political fraternities of Nigerians to appreciate the binding need for accommodation and sacrifice, in supporting a Nigerian President from the South-East region of Nigeria come 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe plannings are complete, the audience is ready, and more patriotic Nigerians are now selfless in championing the truth, that our country can only get better and faster on the wheels of equality, justice, fairness and deliberate inclusion, to all her citizens, especially the Southeast people of Nigeria,\u201d Ugwu added.\n\nHe said aside the nationalist patriots expected in Abuja from all over the country, four governors from the Southeast, who will play central roles to the big idea of a Nigerian President from the Southeast persuasion project, will also be in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt is already heart warming, and a sign of great awareness what one of them, Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo state declared passionately this week that Ndigbo have cried enough on their marginalization, and Nigerians should grant the region a fair playing ground, come 2023 general elections for the Presidency.\n\n\u201cHear him in clear sync with the GNC project: \u2018No one in Nigeria can deny the fact that Ndigbo are zealous, patriotic and committed to the oneness of Nigeria. All that they demand is a level playing field for all of us to operate and compete\u2019.\n\n\u201cAmplifying this firm and fair resolve, he again called Nigerians\u2019 attention to history, thus, \u2018Most of the patriots who engineered the plan that made the Southwest region produce the presidential candidates for the two major political parties in 1999 are still alive and active in Nigerian politics.\n\n\u201c\u2018That same underlying love for the country that inspired them to do what they did for the Southwest in 1999, should inspire them to do the same for the Southeast in 2023\u2032.\n\n\u201cThat simply is a factual foretaste to the many more of what Greater Nigeria Conference will put in the front burner, as it gathers all the presidential aspirants from Southeast before Nigerians to dialogue and persuade the election of one as Nigeria President in the spirit of together-we-can-do-better for this country,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) and the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, have promised to continue to drive policy initiatives that promote investment in infrastructure in the Nigerian telecom industry in order to deepen connectivity to enhance the nation\u2019s growth and development.\n\nThe duo stated this on the sideline of the reception marking the landing of the Equiano undersea Cable System in Nigeria at the Open Access Data Centre at Lekki in Lagos. Pantami and Danbatta commended Google LLC, the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), and other investors for bringing additional bandwidth capacity into the country to drive connectivity and growth.\n\nWhile Pantami was represented at the event by NCC\u2019s Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, Danbatta was represented by the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services at NCC, Ubale Maska. Other senior management staff of the Commission at the event included the NCC\u2019s Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Bako Wakil, and the Controller, NCC\u2019s Ibadan Zonal Office, Yomi Arowosafe.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Ministry, will continue to drive the implementation of existing digital economy-oriented policies already put in place by the current administration. Pantami also promised an enabling environment that encourages foreign and local investment in infrastructure projects such as the way Google and its co-investors have done.\n\nAlso commenting, Danbatta said the Commission\u2019s expectations, initiatives, and vision towards increasing broadband penetration, quality of service, advancement of a digital economy, and commitment to improving national security through technological advancement, are on the priority list of its regulatory interventions.\n\nDanbatta expressed delight that Equiano has joined the list of other submarine cables at the shores of Nigeria, including SAT3 cable, MainOne cable, Glo1 cable, ACE cable WACS cable, Dolphin by Natcom, and MTN respectively.\n\nThe EVC assured stakeholders of Commission\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that the huge bandwidth capacity from these cables at shore in Lagos would be transmitted to different part of the country to drive robust and ubiquitous infrastructure. This is in keeping with the provisions of the digital economy policy being implemented by government in collaboration with all stakeholders.\n\nThe EVC expressed optimism that Google\u2019s investment in the subsea cable, Equiano, will be significant in driving NCC\u2019s ongoing implementation of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, which aims at increasing broadband penetration to 70 per cent by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that Equiano, together with earlier undersea cables in the country, will have additional landing points in the hinterlands through collaborative efforts with NCC-licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos). This will help to reduce retail data prices significantly and thereby complementing the Commission\u2019s efforts at ensuring that affordable Internet services are available to boost the Commission\u2019s ongoing broadband policy initiatives\u201d. Danbatta stated and thereby helped to reiterate the objective linkages of policies and plans in the telecom ecosystem, and the national economic strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who also witnessed the unveiling of the Google submarine cable, underscored its centrality to Nigeria\u2019s ongoing efforts to boost job creation and contribution to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), over the next three years.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of WIOCC, Chris Wood, also described the landing of the submarine cables as a major investment in the Nigerian digital economy.\n\nThe new cable system is named after a Nigerian hero, Olaudah Equiano, who survived enslavement in the 18th century and went on to become a famous writer and anti-slavery activist. Besides the triumph over challenges, which Equiano\u2019s life symbolised, the landing of the cable in Nigeria is expected to underscore Nigeria\u2019s leadership as a regional hub for connectivity, and thus, set to attract cloud operators, content providers, content distribution networks and their associated ecosystems.",
          "summary": "The duo stated this on the sideline of the reception marking the landing of the Equiano undersea Cable System in Nigeria at the Open Access Data Centre at Lekki in Lagos.\nPantami and Danbatta commended Google LLC, the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), and other investors for bringing additional bandwidth capacity into the country to drive connectivity and growth.\nPantami also promised an enabling environment that encourages foreign and local investment in infrastructure projects such as the way Google and its co-investors have done.\nDanbatta expressed delight that Equiano has joined the list of other submarine cables at the shores of Nigeria, including SAT3 cable, MainOne cable, Glo1 cable, ACE cable WACS cable, Dolphin by Natcom, and MTN respectively.\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of WIOCC, Chris Wood, also described the landing of the submarine cables as a major investment in the Nigerian digital economy.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), stakeholders in the academia, the public sector and enthusiasts of technology for development, have deliberated on the benefits derivable from emerging technologies such as Blockchain, to advance the growth of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAt a recently-organised two-day workshop by the Commission, in collaboration with the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), stakeholders were in accord that through effective implementation of policies as expressed in guidelines, regulations and directions driven by the NCC, Blockchain could be a bedrock of economic innovation and growth.\n\nThe workshop, which took place in Abuja and focused on \u2018\u2019Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain) Ecosystem, Decentralisation and Adoption Methods\u2019\u2019, drew participants from financial institutions, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), the academia, the Nigerian military, and paramilitary forces, the Nigerian Cyberwarfare Command, and the private sector.\n\nThe stakeholders, who spoke in turn at the workshop, acknowledged and profoundly appreciated the role of NCC in engendering a dynamic digital regulatory environment, the remarkable contribution to the growth and development of novel and emerging technologies, and NCC\u2019s adoption of adaptive mechanisms that have enhanced emerging technologies in Nigeria.\n\nAddressing a large audience at the event, NCC\u2019s Director, New Media and Information Security, Dr. Haru Al-Hassan, who delivered the opening speech at the event, on behalf of the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said existing national digital economy frameworks such as the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030 instituted by the Federal Government as well as regulatory initiatives by the Commission, have been significant enablers of Blockchain and emerging technologies in the country.\n\nAccording to Al- Hassan, \u201cgood regulatory policies are the bedrock of innovation and growth and it is the aspiration of the Commission that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) otherwise known as Blockchain and other innovative technologies and services would continue to thrive and contribute to the growth and development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Director-General, BPSR, Dr. Dasuki Arabi, informed the audience that the Nigerian government was already making efforts, through a number of initiatives, to harmonizing emerging technologies with the contemporary public service sector in a way that strengthens the efficiency of the public sector. He also affirmed that Blockchain would be central in the implementation of the National e-Govt Masterplan.\n\nThe BPSR Chief Executive equally listed the introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), the Bank Verification Number (BVN), automation of enforcement activities of some agencies of the government, including the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), as well as automated performance measurement systems for public sector employees, as concrete examples of the utilisation of technology in the public sector.\n\nArabi asserted that Nigeria ranks third in Africa, in the use of telecommunications for public service delivery, coming behind South Africa and Egypt. Arabi called on policymakers to ensure robust policy formulation that ensures improved digital literacy and increased automation in public service delivery.\n\nOther speakers at the event included Dr. Abdul-Kareem Oloyede of University of Ilorin, Kwara State; Amaka Ukwueze and Vivian Okonkwo, both of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), Enugu State, and Col. Romi Legha of the Indian High Commission.\n\nOloyede, who clarified the difference between Blockchain and Bitcoin, stated that the former is the underlying technology used for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also stated that Blockchain could be utilised to minimise expenditure and expenses, speed up transactions, and improve data security for financial institutions, health care, and businesses.\n\nUkwueze particularly applauded the Commission for taking the lead in discussions on DLTs considering the fact that Nigeria does not have a clear-cut Blockchain policy yet, even though countries worldwide had begun integrating DLT as a central part of their business practices.\n\n\u201cRepublic of Malta, a southern European island country, located in the south central region of the Mediterranean Sea, incorporated Blockchain into its digital and economic ecosystem. Also, China, Abu Dhabi, and Japan are also instituting DLT-friendly regulations in their governance processes,\u201d Ukwueze said.\n\nAccordingly, Ukwueze urged the Federal Government to adopt Blockchain deployment actively, promote legal certainty for Blockchain applications, and provide a flexible and adaptive regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Conclusively, Ukwueze stated that \u201cgovernment\u2019s regulatory enforcement processes must seek to encourage companies to be consumer-centric and ensure compliance\u201d.\n\nIn her contribution to the discourse, Okonkwo said adoption of Blockchain technology would be essential in documentation, archiving, cloud storage, identity management, and online education. Additionally, Okonkwo declared that blockchain is a cost-effective method of optimising the quality of the educational administrative processes, and equally a cost-effective application that could improve service delivery across the nation.\n\nThe DLT, such as Blockchain, DAG; Hashgraph; Holochain; Tempo (Radix), is a digital system for recording transactions of assets at multiple places simultaneously. The key features of DLT include: immutability (once written, it is extremely difficult to alter), and peer-to-peer sharing, in the sense that ledger is shared among peers while there is no central ownership.",

          "text": "\n\n\u2018I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring; the political process is ongoing\u2019\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday in Abuja came under intense pressure from his supporters, urging him to contest for president in 2023 and he did not disappoint, telling them that \u201cthe political process is ongoing; just watch out. just watch out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe supporters, comprising largely women and youths, stormed the Jonathan Foundation\u2019s Abuja office, chanting his name, forcing him to come out to address them.\n\n\n\nThe former president acknowledged that youths wanted him to contest for President in 2023, but told the supporters that he could not, for now, tell Nigerians whether he would be contesting and that his final decision would manifest very soon.\n\n\n\nJonathan said: \u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing. Yes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring, the political process is ongoing. Just watch out. The key thing you must do is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries young people along, somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems raised are tackled.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the youths of Nigeria. For you to come this morning in this manner shows clearly that the youth are interested in politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted the youth to get involved in politics. And luckily, the Not Too Young to Run Act has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in the country. So, we continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan noted that the country was facing challenges, saying that some of the challenges started a long time ago, stressing that he believed in the interest of young people and that the challenges would be dealt with.\n\nThe supporters, who demanded the return of Jonathan as President in 2023, arrived in four buses and displayed placards at Jonathan\u2019s Taraba Close, Maitama office.\n\n\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cGoodluck declare now\u201d; \u201cWe are sorry, Goodluck don\u2019t abandon us, come back\u201d; \u201cGoodluck please come\u201d; and \u201cGoodluck we love you\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the supporters, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria, said, \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realised our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuel admitted that they were deceived to believe that the administration of Jonathan was bad and that they were out in their numbers to seek Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\n\nHe noted that they had realised their mistake and that the \u201csaboteurs\u201d that came after him were empty.\n\nSamuel adds: \u201cWe are here to say sir, forgive us, come and lead us again. We are calling on you to come and take the mantle of leadership in 2023. Nigeria is in comatose. Please answer this call, the youth are here, the women are here, the children are here, pregnant women are here, please hear their cry.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are here to call on our former president.

          "text": "\n\n*Says God does not make mistakes and has prepared him for president\n\nKemi Olaitan\n\nVice President and Presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, in his first trip after declaration, took his campaign to Ibadan Oyo State, where he met with the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Lekan Balogun (Ali-Iwo Okunmade II) and thereafter interacted with APC stakeholders in the state.\n\nOn arrival in Ibadan, the Vice President received a rousing reception right from the airport and on the streets by excited residents.\n\nComing after Osinbajo declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC last week Monday, the vice president intimated the Monarch of his intention to run for president.\n\nHe told the Olubadan that Nigeria needed leaders who deeply care about the common man and the progress of the nation.\n\nThe Vice President said: \u201cI have followed you very closely. I think that one of the most important things is that the country needs people, those who have feelings for the common person; people who deeply care about the common man.\u201d\n\nWhile praising the Olubadan for always being a lover of the common people, even before he ascended the throne, he said: \u201cno matter in whatever shape of form, even as Kabiyesi, you are still going to be the Kabiyesi of the common man, Kabiyesi of the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the vice president, the people of Ibadan are not only blessed with an intellectual but one who cares for the people.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cAs the Olubadan, Your Royal Majesty, you are a great gift to the people of Ibadan and also to us as a nation. I pray that your years will be very long and that all the people of this great city, kingdom will feel the impact, and that they will all know that you are someone who cares about them.\n\n\u201cAs you know, on April 11, 2022, I declared my intention to run for the presidency of our great land under the flag of our party, the great party, the All Progressives Congress. I did so while taking into account the fact that our country needs all of those who are willing to serve it to the best of their capacity and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWith great humility and sincerity, I come to your majesty, that after serving about seven years as Vice President, and also as acting, under our President, President Muhammadu Buhari, who truly gave me every opportunity; he opened up doors in a way that most deputies may not have experienced, and entrusting a lot to my care, including very sensitive positions.\n\n\u201cAfter all of that, I felt that it would be the right thing to do, to make that experience available to the people of our country. By the grace of God and the will of the people, if I am voted in as the President come 2023, I believe that there is so much to do. The desire of our hearts is that our country will be much greater and will be able to attain all of the great potentials of our people.\u201d\n\nDescribing the monarch as a \u201cfather of all,\u201d Osinbajo thanked him for the warm reception, noting that he will always covet the Olubadan\u2019s \u201cprayers and good wishes all the time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou can be sure that wherever I am and in whatever situation I am, I hold you in the highest esteem, I will always continuously support whatever it is that you want to do, either for yourself or the great people of Ibadan.\u201d\n\nThe Olubadan described the Vice President as \u201ca wonderful human being, a wonderful person,\n\n\u201cHopefully, in God\u2019s name, you will be President of Nigeria,\u201d he told the VP, adding that \u201cmay Allah grant you success on what you have in mind, may Allah support you. I can spend the next two hours just praying for you.\u201d\n\nIbadan High Chiefs present also expressed their support for the Vice President\u2019s aspirations, declaring that \u201cwe are with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with APC Stakeholders\n\nOsinbajo later departed the palace to interact with APC leaders and delegates in Oyo State at an impressive event where his speech was often interrupted with singing as the audience kept bursting out in festive renditions of different political lyrics welcoming the VP\u2019s emergence and expressions of support for him.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the seven years that I have been involved, because the President considered it the right thing to do and, in his generosity, and openness, he gave me every opportunity to serve, including sensitive international assignments.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I also acted as President during certain periods when the President was away and everything I learnt as acting President has prepared me to run as President of our country.\n\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t make mistakes. God is deliberate in everything He does and by giving me all of these opportunities to understand governance for myself at the highest level of our country, all of it was not just so that I can sit down and write a memoir, no, it was to come handy one day and I believe the time has come.\n\n\u201cI believe that the time has come and I have the responsibility to my country, to you, to all our children and the coming generations to give all of what I have learnt, everything I have learnt, all of the services to be able to give it to our country. To serve our country faithfully and honestly is my intention.\n\n\u201cOne advantage I would have is that on day one, I can hit the ground running because I know what it takes.\u201d\n\nOther speakers at the event included Senator Teslim Folarin, Chief Niyi Akintola, Chief Jacob Tilley-Gyado and the APC Chairman in Oyo State Hon. Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu, who all expressed support for the Vice President\u2019s aspiration.\n\nAccording to Akintola, \u201cWhen it comes to the candidacy of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, there are no factions at all.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, who travelled with a number of National Assembly members from Abuja, was received by the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan at the Ibadan airport. The Deputy Governor also joined the vice president for the visit to the Olubadan.\n\nMembers of the National Assembly with the Vice President besides Folarin, included Senator Adamu Bukkachuwa, Kola Balogun, Fatahu Muhammad, Odebunmi Olusegun, Shehu Saleh Rijau and Karu Simon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has pulled out of the drive by the northern Peoples Democratic Party to produce consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis came just as news emerged that former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed had emerged PDP consensus candidates for the North.\n\nA statement by the Tambuwal Campaign Organization (TCO) Friday said the team met on Wednesday at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja for a review and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\u201d\n\nWith the latest development, Tambuwal will join former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who had earlier rejected the consensus drive, and other PDP aspirants to vie for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nThe statement read: The attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organization (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Gov. Bala Muhammad of Bauchi state have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger state.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.The correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday 20th April, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and, unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Sen. Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm of the same day was aborted unilaterally by Sen. Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, 21st, 2022, same Sen Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday, Gov. Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Gov. Tambuwal was absent at today\u2019s (Friday) meeting in Minna. As a result therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Gov. Tambuwal, who had earlier on informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis is in consonance with his acclaimed outlook as a pan-Nigerian candidate, with pedigree of national service as the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, life member of the Body of Benchers and now in his second and final term as Governor of Sokoto state.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Fears situation may linger except citizens offer information*Orders release of kidnapped Kaduna train passengers\n\n*IG justifies police presence in South-east, says attacks on officers no longer tolerated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen yesterday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel. For now, I know already that 3,000 personnel cannot take care of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally do is to deploy from other states to come and complement the efforts of Kaduna by what we are calling, let\u2019s say, special duty. We can take from states, where we feel the threat is not as eminent or as bad as what they have in Kaduna, so that you can complement Kaduna. So, also you can complement Imo, Anambra. It\u2019s based on your threat analysis.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Baba, has warned that the police high command would no longer tolerate incessant killing of police officers in the country especially, the South-east.\n\nHe condemned the recent spate of attacks on police officers, facilities and other police operational assets across the country.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, consequently, ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and other operations launched with the aim of flushing out criminal elements, who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts.\n\n\u201cThe IG warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the IG reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property, while stressing that it was vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "text": "Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd Ignatius Kaigama, has charged President Muhammadu Buhari and the 36 governors to without any further delay find possible ways to address the continued insecurity, economic downturn and national strike by university lecturers in the country.\n\nThe cleric made the call on Saturday while addressing the maiden general congress of the indigenous people of the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja.\n\nFile Photo of the Archbishop of Abuja, Ignatius Kaigama\n\nHe stated that Nigerian people were sad, angry and frustrated with the situation of the country.\n\nThe archbishop frowned at the unguided display of wealth by political actors, especially the high cost of party nomination forms for the 2023 general elections and warned that if the situation is not remedied on time, it might destroy the fabric of Nigeria\u2019s nationhood.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s insecurity, hunger, unemployment, and the youths are out of school. Government should be responsible and provide for us. Unfortunately, that is not happening and there is a very great degree of disaffection. People are angry, sad and frustrated.\n\n\u201cWe are saying the government should wake-up to its responsibilities. The government should open its eyes and look at the people with justice and mercy.\n\n\u201cThe insensitivity of our politicians amazes me. They know there is sufferings in the land, but I can see an arrogant display of wealth in the way they organise their political activities and events, but there is no money to ensure security, to ensure the university students go back to school, to ensure that people can afford food in the market, and to service the health sector.\n\n\u201cI call on our leaders to rethink and know that there is God and He is watching. The resources we have, let us use it for our people and not personal interest. Politics is all about service to the people, and good governance. It is not just about aspiring to gain access to the wealth of the nation and use it in a very arbitrary manner.\n\n\u201cOur leaders must stop and think. Something is wrong. Our people are bottling up their anger for so long. Let the leaders not allow this anger to burst, because it is going to be terrible.\n\n\u201cWe hope that something will be done quickly and also with sensitivity to the needs of the people, whether it is electricity, university education, water supply, roads, and above all, security. We need these things now. We elected our political leaders to provide these, and they promised to do so, but we are dismayed that they are so incapable and unwilling to provide these basics for the people.\u201d",

Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Blockchain-powered insurance: Meet the decentralised insurance protocol, Etherisc, insuring Kenyan farms against bad climate",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

The newly deployed CP takes over from Philip Ogbadu who retired from the force after 35 years of service.\n\nThe governor during the visit, along with the CP, decorated 10 newly promoted police officers.\n\nObaseki said as a result of the increased collaboration with the NPF, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba has deployed a special tactical team to complement the government\u2019s efforts at restoring peace and sanity across Edo communities.\n\nThe governor who described the issue of land grabbing in various communities in the state as worrisome, said the IGP will deploy special squads to assist in restoring sanity to communities across the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank the IGP for deploying two police special squads to Edo State. We would soon inspect their accommodation as they will be deployed to the state in the next few weeks. This squad will deal with community issues and issues of land grabbing. We need your support and that of the area command. I have spoken with the AIG who assured us that all land cases that come to the area command will be referred to the Edo Command.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with the issue of land grabbing squarely as it is impeding development in Edo State. We have a land committee in place, which is currently reviewing cases before it. We are making resources available to fight this menace in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who urged the new CP to develop a mechanism to forestall electoral violence during the forthcoming Presidential elections, added, \u201cAs we prepare for another set of elections, we want to work with you to design a system that will not allow electoral violence in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe want to tackle electoral violence. We must have a peaceful election; both pre and post-electioneering activities must be peaceful in Edo State.

Totally unexpected and unanticipated,\u201d Chief Adeniyi said.\n\n\u201cThe Alaafin Oba Adeyemi lll was a veritable inspirer and an inspiration to Yoruba self-consciousness. He was a towering pillar of support and great defender of our spiritual faith. He believed in the avowed rightness of the Yoruba Self-Determination agenda the same way he believed in the freedom of all peoples the world over to determine and choose the way they want to be governed.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi was a phenomenal monarch and an embodiment of the quintessential Yoruba mores, traditions and culture and a huge encyclopaedia of Yoruba history.

During this critical moment in our nation\u2019s history, we need healing and not further divisive statements, ethnic or regional chauvinism, endorsement, and or consensuship to further divide us apart.\n\n\u201cRight now, Nigeria desperately needs a unifier, a president for all Nigerians, and NOT one for a particular section of the country. It is important to note that the Wazirin Adamawa, His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, GCON is contesting for the office of the President of Nigeria as a Nigerian candidate aimed at uniting and rebuilding the nation, and not as a northern or regional candidate. This informed his decision not to subject himself to any consensus arrangement guided by regional sentiment.\n\n\u201cNigerians are wiser now and need a man with the capacity to fix the nation. With very strong capacity and rich credentials, we firmly believe that the PDP national delegates will no doubt support His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar to lead the party to victory in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are not perturbed by the consensus decision of the Prof. Ango Abdullahi-led Northern Elders group because it\u2019s inconsequential and of no political effect whatsoever. We wish to advise the duo of Sen. Bukola Saraki and Gov. Bala Mohammed to submit and subject themselves to the scrutiny and decision of the PDP\u2019s national delegates, and not to a regional ethnic group.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on Nigerians and all the PDP national delegates to disregard such consensus arrangement, remain steadfast, and continue to rally support around Atiku Abubakar to clinch victory to rebuild and unite Nigerians as one people, one nation and one destiny,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte, and then suggested he may now retire from the sport.\n\nFury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut.\n\nWhyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted.\n\n\u201cThis might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,\u201d Fury said post-fight.\n\nFury \u2013 who also retained his Ring Magazine belt \u2013 is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte \u2013 suffering his third loss in 31 bouts \u2013 falls short on his first attempt at a world title.\n\nIf Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown \u2013 a fight which could potentially be staged later this year \u2013 and a chance to cement his status as Britain\u2019s greatest ever heavyweight.\n\n\u201cI promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out.\u201d\n\nRecord crowd witnesses Fury\u2019s greatest punch\n\nWith 94,000 fans in attendance \u2013 a post-war British record \u2013 there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history.\n\nBoos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring.\n\nFury\u2019s ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s \u2018American Pie\u2019, soon turned into \u2018Juicy\u2019 by Notorious B.I.G and ended on \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019 by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring.\n\nHe towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte\u2019s dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round.\n\nIt was then Fury\u2019s turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds.\n\nHe landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at the champion. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed.\n\nThe contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury.\n\nThe fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone.\n\nWhyte\u2019s telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease.\n\nThen came arguably Fury\u2019s greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut.\n\nWhyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This is perhaps, the largest collection of bankers on the FMBN that I can remember in a long time.\u201d the Minister said.\n\nHe also advised the Board and Management to promptly engage with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and ensure FMBN\u2019s compliance with regulatory stipulations for operating as a Bank. He mandated them to work speedily to complete the over 2000 housing units at different levels of completion under the Ministerial Pilot Housing Scheme.\n\nThose inaugurated include: Hamman Madu as the Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, Umar Zubaida, Executive Director, Finance and Corporate Services, Chukwuma Kingsley, Executive Director, Business Development & Portfolio Management (BD&PM); Mustapha Lukman Olayiwola, Executive Director, Loans & Mortgage Services (L&MS); Asein Abimbola representing the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing; Ejezie Sandra Nkechi, representing the Public.\n\nFurthermore, the minister expressed appreciation to the immediate past Board and Executive Management Team for their service saying their efforts cannot be forgotten.\n\nIn his response, the new FMBN Managing Director/Chief Executive, Madu Hamman on behalf of the Board members and Executive Management Team, thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for the privilege and opportunity to serve the nation.\n\nHe expressed his profound gratitude to the minister of Works and Housing for finding them worthy to serve the country in those capacities and promised that the team will work harmoniously within the framework of the Acts establishing the FMBN to reposition the Bank to deliver on his mandate.\n\n\u201cWe are humbled and excited to be chosen to undertake this onerous responsibility. We would maintain a high level of corporate governance in line with best practices while delivering enhanced performance towards repositioning the Bank to play its primary role as the apex Mortgage Bank in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would leverage all our competencies to ensure that we restore FMBN on the path of growth and increased impact in line with its mandate and expectations of the government\u201d Madu said.\n\nHe further added that they would count on the support of the hon. minister to achieve all the desired results at the Bank.\n\nThe Board Chairman, Mr. Ayodeji Ariyo Gbeleyi, in his remarks at the event assured the hon. Minister of Works and Housing that the Board is clear on the impact and strategic importance of housing and will work hard to deliver on the mandate bestowed on them and meet government expectations.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Obisue\n\nPresident of the World Bank Group, David Malpass has asked the Federal Government to have a rethink on its policy on fuel subsidy, stating that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled into other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass noted this on Wednesday at a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate last week approved N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

          "text": "The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, has been buried in the ancient town of Oyo in south-west Nigeria.\n\nHis remains were laid to rest on Saturday within the premises of the palace, barely a day after he was certified dead in a hospital in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital.\n\nAlaafin, popularly known as \u2018Iku Baba Yeye, was 83 years as of the time his death was announced.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his demise, Islamic rites were conducted on the body of late Alaafin, signalling the beginning of his final journey home.\n\nIslamic clerics led by the Chief Imam of Oyo town were joined by members of the family of the late traditional ruler and some of his chiefs to offer prayers for the repose of his soul.\n\nAfter the prayers, his body was taken back to the palace where the final burial was held.\n\nAn Oyo prince and a close relative of the Alaafin, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu, confirmed the burial of the monarch to Channels Television.\n\n\ufeff\n\n52-Year Reign\n\nThe news of the death of the top Yoruba traditional ruler broke on Saturday morning hours after he died at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti.\n\nAlaafin Adeyemi, who served as the permanent chairperson of the Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, was reportedly sick and was scheduled to be flown abroad for treatment before he joined his ancestors on Friday.\n\nHe was the third to ascend the throne from the Alowolodu Ruling House and ruled for 52 years \u2013 making him the longest-reigning traditional ruler in Oyo town.\n\nAlaafin was born Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi on October 15, 1938, and succeeded Oba Gbadegesin Ladigbolu I, as the new Alaafin on November 18, 1970.\n\nFollowing his demise, the Bashorun of Oyo and Head of the \u2018Oyo Mesi\u2019, Yusuf Akinade, is expected to lead Oyo town before a new Alaafin would be installed.\n\nThe monarch died months after the death of two other top traditional rulers in the state \u2013 the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi.\n\nWhile Oba Olalekan Balogun has been crowned as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadan land, the people of Ogbomoso have yet to get a new traditional ruler.\n\nA Golden King\n\nReacting to the death of the traditional ruler, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State declared that the incident was a huge loss to the state, Nigeria, and the Yoruba race.\n\nHe described Oba Adeyemi\u2019s death as a personal loss to him, adding that he was an ever-supportive royal father and a worthy leader who spared nothing in trying to make Oyo State and Nigeria greater.\n\nThe governor, who said Alaafin\u2019s words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful, condoled with the Oyo State Traditional Council, the Oyomesi, Oba Adeyemi\u2019s immediate family, the people of Oyo Kingdom, and the entire Yoruba race and prayed to God to grant repose to the soul of the departed monarch.\n\nHe stated that apart from Oyo State losing its last man standing in the rank of experienced monarchs with long years of royal leadership, it has also lost a royal institution and an authority, which Alaafin had become by virtue of his high-octane understanding of Yoruba history, politics, and national development.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi was our last man standing in the rank of most eminent royal fathers with long years of leadership,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHe became a golden king, an institution and an authority rolled into one by virtue of his immense experience, wisdom and understanding of Yoruba history, royalty, and politics.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi not only elevated the Alaafin throne with his knowledge and wisdom, but he also became a worthy exemplar for royal leadership in Africa and brought glory to Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi never spared anything in his strive to make Oyo State greater and to bring about the Nigeria of everyone\u2019s collective dream.\u201d\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo is also among prominent leaders who have paid tribute to the late Alaafin whom he said was a symbol of Nigeria\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation.\n\nObasanjo, in a letter, condoled with Governor Makinde, the family of Oba Adeyemi, and the entire people of Oyo on the transition.\n\nHe stated that the late highly revered monarch was a patriotic and respected traditional ruler who had immeasurable love for his people and great faith in a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe (Alaafin) stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs, and he was as well a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance and understanding, not only among the diverse people who live in his domain but also across the country,\u201d the elder statesman was quoted as saying in a statement by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\nAccording to him, it was during Oba Adeyemi\u2019s reign that Oyo town got transformed into the modern city that it has become and his contribution to nation-building was also acknowledged in the conferment of the esteemed national honour of Commander of the Federal Republic, CFR, on him and other honorary degrees that he received from Nigerian and outside educational institutions.",

Kabiyesi never spared anything in his strive to make Oyo State greater and to bring about the Nigeria of everyone\u2019s collective dream.\n\n\u201cPersonally, Kabiyesi\u2019s death is a great loss to me, because he proved to be a worthy father and had been ever so supportive of our government.\n\n\u201cHis words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer that God accepts Kabiyesi\u2019s soul into Aljanah Firdaus and uphold everyone and everything he left behind.\n\n\u201cGood night, Iku Baba Yeye!\u201d\n\n\u2018Like a dream\u2019\n\nIn a condolence letter to Governor Makinde, former President Obasanjo described the highly revered monarch as patriotic and one who had immeasurable love for his people and great faith in a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs and he was as well a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance and understanding not only among the diverse people who live in his domain but also across the country,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\n\u201cIt is well acknowledged that it was during his reign that Oyo Town got transformed to the modern city that it has become today and not surprisingly, his contribution to nation-building was also acknowledged in the conferment of the esteemed national honour of Commander of the Federal Republic, CFR, on him and other honorary degrees that he received from some Nigerian and outside educational institutions.\n\n\u201cLike most great leaders, Alaafin was all things to all people. To his family, he was a tower of strength and a committed provider; to his community of Oyo land, he was an early model in national leadership; to his Yoruba kinsmen, he was a worthy Ambassador; and to the rest of Nigeria, he was a symbol of a nation\u2019s epic struggle in self-discovery and self-actualisation.\n\n\u201cAlthough Oba Adeyemi\u2019s passage is like a dream, especially as he left us at a crucial state in our nation\u2019s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed, I would urge you and all the members of his immediate and extended family to take solace in the worthy legacy and his mark on the history of this country he left behind. In fact, we ought to give gratitude to God for his worthy life.\n\n\u201cMay God grant his family, the good people of Oyo land and the entire Oyo State the grace to bear the heavy loss of his death. May the soul of the dear departed rest in perfect peace.\u201d\n\n\u2018Man of peace\u2019\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila said the Alaafin\u2019s touched him personally.\n\nIn a statement signed by his spokesperson, Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker said the news \u201ccame to him as a rude shock, describing the late Alaafin, who had been like a father to him, as a very intelligent father with a sound grasp of traditional, social, political and international history.\n\n\u201cAccording to him, Oba Adeyemi was a man of peace whose five decades of quality leadership to his people endeared him to the masses.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Gbajabiamila, who was recently appointed the Aare Baasofin of Yoruba Land by the late Alaafin, said the death of the traditional ruler has created a void too difficult to fill.\n\n\u201cHe said the Alaafin would be sorely missed by him and all Nigerians, especially the Yoruba people, as he served as a father figure to all, giving wise counsel when needed. He has supported the political career of many Nigerian leaders especially in the quest of Gbajabiamila\u2019s journey to the Speakership of the country.\n\n\u201cWhile praying for Allah (SWT) to find a peaceful resting place for the Alaafin, Gbajabiamila sent his condolences to the people and Government of Oyo State, especially the Royal Family and the entire Yoruba race.\u201d\n\n\u2018A trying moment\u2019\n\nA coalition of North-Central Governors have also paid tributes to the late Alaafin.\n\nLeader of the coalition, Governor Abubabar Bello of Niger State, described the death as sorrowful considering his immense contributions to not only the Yoruba land, but the nation in general.\n\nHe observed that the late monarch, who ruled for 52 years, left a vacuum which will take God to fill up.\n\nThe NCGF Chairman however said death is an end to all mortals and a transition to the life hereafter, urging the government of Oyo and the entire people of Yoruba land to see the death of the monarch as an act of God and be comforted by the fact that he lived an accomplished and exemplary life.\n\n\u201cI see this as sorrowful and a trying moment for the people of Oyo State in particular and Yoruba race at large,\u201d the Governor said. They lost two traditional rulers not really up to five months and now a top monarch.\n\n\u201cHowever, we cannot question God but to rather accept it as a necessary end to all the living. The only thing we can do now is to continue to pray for the repose of the soul of the deceased and for God to comfort and preserve all that he left behind.\n\n\u201cI sincerely sympathize with my colleague, Seyi Makinde and the entire people of the state and my prayers are with them.\u201d\n\nRespected royal father\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, described the late Oyo monarch as a brave and courageous king who did everything possible to preserve the culture and tradition of his people.\n\nIn a statement signed by his spokesperson, Nathaniel Ikyur, he noted that Oba Adeyemi\u2019s reign witnessed peace and unity of the kingdom, which created the enabling environment for growth and development, not just in Oyo State but also in Nigeria.\n\nOrtom lamented that the late monarch departed at a time when his wisdom and wealth of experience was needed to navigate through the the murky waters of politics and the national insecurity threatening the corporate exitence of our dear country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi was a respected royal father who was conscious about the peace and unity of his kingdom and the nation. We shall miss his tutelage and wise counsel\u201d, the governor said.\n\nHe however admonished the people of Oyo state to take solace in the fact that the late monarch lived an eventful and accomplished life worthy of emulation.\n\nThe Governor asked the governor of the state to immortalize the Oba in recognition of his sacrifices and contributions to the development of the society.\n\nDedicated to service\n\nOn his part, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike said it was with a deep sense of shock and sadness that he learnt of the passing of His Royal Majesty, Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III.\n\n\u201cI wish to convey, on behalf of the Government and the people of Rivers State, my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the Royal family, Government and people of Oyo State on this sad loss,\u201d Wike said in a statement signed by his spokesperson Kelvin Ebiri.\n\nHe said late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi will always be remembered for the invaluable role he played in helping build bridges and encouraging peace in the country.\n\n\u201cMay his family, Government and good people of Oyo State find comfort and renewed strength to bear this great loss. The Oba was a man who dedicated his life to the service of his people and country. The late Alaafin\u2019s family and people of Oyo State are in our thoughts and prayers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018A big iroko\u2019\n\nAPC Chieftain Bola Ahmed Tinubu said he was deeply saddened by the news.\n\n\u201cAfter ascending to the royal throne at the age of 31, Alaafin became one of the most influential, greatly respected traditional rulers in Yorubaland, Nigeria and indeed Africa and beyond,\u201d Tinubu said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAlaafin fostered harmony and brought prosperity and development to the ancient Oyo Kingdom. He was loved by his people.\n\n\u201cWisely ruling on the throne for 52 years, he became the longest reigning Alaafin that ever ruled Oyo Kingdom. With his transition, a big Iroko has fallen. His passing was an auspicious era in the ancient Oyo Kingdom, but also for the Yoruba and the entirety of the black race.\n\n\u201cAn elder-statesman and patriot, Alaafin Adeyemi was bold and courageous. He spoke truth to power. His interventions in national affairs helped the nation navigate difficult moments and helped usher a more just society.\n\n\u201cHe played vital roles in the struggle for democracy, working assiduously towards the establishment of our democracy.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of his important contributions to peace, religious harmony and stability in Nigeria, the nation gifted him the high honour of Commander of the Federal Republic.\n\n\u201cAlaafin was also a strong pillar of the arts, culture and tradition. Kabiyesi took upon himself the task of promoting Nigerian arts and culture for which he received many ambassadorial awards in Nigeria and beyond.\n\n\u201cI had an abiding personal relationship with Alaafin whom I deeply respected. Mentor, leader and father figure, I visited Kabiyesi in February his palace in Oyo to seek his prayers and blessings which he graciously gave, little did I know it was the last time we would see each other face to face.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with his wonderful and loving family, particularly his wives and children. I commiserate with the Oyomesi, the chiefs and the people of Oyo kingdom. My condolences also to Governor Seyi Makinde and the people of Oyo State, and indeed the entire nation over the demise of this eminent traditional ruler. The black race has lost a titan who will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cI pray that his family, Oyo Kingdom, the Yoruba race and indeed all Nigerians find consolation and strength in that we must now dedicate ourselves to live up to the ideals for which Alaafin stood.\n\n\u201cMay the soul of Alaafin Adeyemi rest in perfect peace.\u201d\n\nHuge vacuum\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun described the monarch\u2019s death as a tragic and occurred when least expected.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with the Oyomesi, the wives and children of the late monarch and the entire Adeyemi family over this irreplaceable loss. I pray for their comfort and peace at the trying times,\u201d the Governor said in a statement by his spokesperson, Kunle Somorin.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Kabiyesi had to take his leave of us, at this period, when we need his wisdom the most, as we approach the 2023 general elections, a critical period in our political landmarks.\u201d\n\nGovernor Abiodun noted that Alaafin\u2019s death will create a huge vacuum in the entire Yorubaland, while his sagacious and royal counsel will be sorely missed\n\nHe further described the late monarch as a quintessential traditional ruler, custodian and exemplar of Yoruba culture and tradition, said that posterity and history will remember Oba Adeyemi\u2019s service and dedication to the Yorubaland, and immense contributions to ensure peace and unity in the country.",

I used the crowd energy which was phenomenal, probably the best atmosphere that I played in my entire life.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: PSG Wrap Up Record-Equalling 10th Ligue 1 Title Despite Lens Draw\n\nFor the third match in a row, Djokovic dropped the first set after losing his serve in the opening game, but the Serb stepped up his level in the second and third sets.\n\n\u201cAll three matches were key matches for me, to be honest,\u201d added said Djokovic.\n\n\u201cAgain I started not that great, losing the first set.

Contee said at least 20 shots were fired.\n\n\u2018SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING\u2019\n\nThe late-afternoon violence unfolded along a busy Connecticut Avenue corridor that is also home to several foreign embassies, the Howard University School of Law and a campus of the University of the District of Columbia.\n\nDeaven Rector, 22, a law student, told Reuters he heard three bursts of gunfire that seemed to emanate from the AVA Van Ness apartment building where he lives, and which was evacuated.\n\n\u201cRight now, the police have secured the area, and it\u2019s safe, but the fact that this type of chaos can be caused by a maniac on a regular Friday\u2026 The kids were about to get out of school,\u201d he said.\n\nJennifer DiGiacinto told Reuters she learned of the shooting from a text message from her son, a Burke School 11th grader.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018There\u2019s something bad happening, I need you to turn on the news.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why, what\u2019s happening?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Gunfire, I\u2019m under a desk, we\u2019re barricaded in.\u2019\u201d\n\nLocal news footage showed Connecticut Avenue blockaded by emergency vehicles. Dozens of police vehicles with flashing lights were parked outside the school building, as police in full tactical gear and some in camouflage assembled nearby.\n\nLocal NBC affiliate WRC-TV showed evacuees from a building running down a sidewalk, some with their hands raised.\n\nLamenting the trauma of gun violence that has become commonplace in the United States, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters, \u201cUnfortunately, I had to look in parents\u2019 eyes tonight who were terrified. And they were terrified thinking of what might happen to their children.\u201d\n\nReuters",

As such, these newly bred operatives would be employed as part of our offensive to ensure normalcy and calm are restored to restive communities within Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGround Training Command remains resolute in ensuring qualitative training to enable us to have the best quality, as well as the right numerical strength of personnel to prosecute the fight against terrorism and insurgency working in synergy with sister Services and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, in equipping them for the task ahead, some of the curricula of the Advanced Special Operations Course entailed counter improvised explosive devices training, air-to-ground integration, remotely piloted aerial systems training, close quarter battle drills, among others, emphasising that, \u201cas expected, the course was intentionally made tough to ensure that our trainees can withstand the gruelling physical conditions of ground operations.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed optimism that the graduating students have imbibed the necessary skills, tactics, techniques and procedures required to conduct special operations pursuant to achieving the operational objectives of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nAmao, who was represented by the Chief of Policy and Plan, Air Vice Marshal Charles Ohwo, said that in furtherance of his vision of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives, the Nigerian Air Force has so far trained about 5,000 Regiment and 2,000 Special Operations Forces personnel.\n\nAmao said the 150 graduating students of the Advanced Special Operations Course 1/2022 are however the first set of personnel to undergo in-Country Advanced Special Operations training, adding that the NAF\u2019s ability to train this large number of personnel at a reasonable cost was possible because the training was conducted in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Commander, British Military Advisory Training Team, Col. Rory Shannon, described the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with Nigeria and with its military as \u201cdeep-rooted and very strong.\u201d\n\nShannon said, \u201cAt the Security and Defense Dialogue that was held between the United Kingdom and Nigeria\u2019s Armed Forces and other Agencies in January of this year, our Chief of Defense Staff Spoke reiterating a desire to strengthen links between our militaries including in this particular area.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria-UK relations is hugely important. The deployment of what we\u2019ve conveyed here will help save lives and defeat a common enemy. So, I know that there are continuing close cooperation, we will continue to contribute to improving the security situation.\u201d\n\nThe Advanced Operatives Course has helped develop the foundation, building on previous training, and setting participants and students up for much more effective counter-violent extremists operations in North-East Nigeria, the Lake Chad Basin and other troubled areas.\n\nTHISDAY",
