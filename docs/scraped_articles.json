          "text": "Actor Will Smith apologised Monday to Chris Rock for hitting the comedian during the live broadcast of the glitzy Oscar ceremony in Hollywood.\n\nThe apology came after the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences, the body that awards the Oscars, said it was launching a formal review of the shocking incident when Smith attacked the comedian over a joke about his wife\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cI would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be,\u201d Smith had posted on his official Instagram page.\n\n\u201cViolence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.\n\n\u201cJokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally,\u201d Smith sobered up.\n\nPinkett Smith suffers from alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss and had a closely cropped head at Sunday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards was in its final hour when actor and comedian Rock quipped that Pinkett Smith appeared ready to star in G.I. Jane 2 \u2013 a putative sequel to a film about a female soldier who has a shaved head.\n\nAfter at first appearing to laugh at the joke, Smith walked onto the stage and smacked Rock with an open hand.\n\nHe then returned to his seat and shouted, \u201cKeep my wife\u2019s name out of your fucking mouth.\u201d\n\nSmith tearfully apologized to his fellow nominees and the Academy \u2013 but not Rock \u2013 a few minutes later as he accepted his historic Oscar.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "THE Nigerian Institute of Environmental Engineers has assured residents of Lagos State that it would utilise groundwater to tackle the problems of unsafe water and water scarcity.\n\nResidents of the state have been reacting to the water scarcity experienced in Ketu, Ikorodu, Surulere and Alimosho areas of the state.\n\nThe National President of NIEE, Sesan Odukoya, during an interview with our correspondent on Monday in Alausa, Ikeja, said the institute would partner with the government to ensure availability of potable water.\n\nHe said, \u201cWater scarcity in the state is a concern to us because people must have access to clean water. The level of compliance coming from the water cooperation is less than 25 per cent and the type of water residents readily have access to, is not potable. Article VI of the Sustainable Development Goals talks about access to water and sanitation, and this water has to be potable.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, most of the surface water people use are polluted and not safe. There are many heavy metals that pollute our waters, particularly in Lagos, a major industrial hub. There is also seepage from landfills and septic tanks due to the indiscriminate siting of boreholes leading to health challenges among residents.\n\n\u201cSo, to tackle this lack of safe water, we want to first create awareness; collaborate with the government, the society and other stakeholders to ensure that people have access to safe water.\n\n\u201cThis year, as we observed the World Water Day, we plan to make groundwater feasible because we have seen that the water that comes from the supply is not adequate for the people. Groundwater has been well-utilised by various companies, but homes and businesses too need this, so we are working to create policies with the government, protect and preserve wetlands and promote the accessibility and visibility of groundwater through boreholes and promotion of integrated water system.\u201d\n\nOdukoya also explained that the NIEE will tackle the challenges of exploitation of groundwater.\n\n\u201cAs environmental engineers, we are concerned about the way sewage and industrial wastes are dumped into the lagoon. This is one of the challenges we are facing because somebody is drinking that water downstream, so whatever thing that you have done upstream, its effects will be felt by somebody downstream.\n\n\u201cThe pollutants we dispose of in the waters return to us and this could explain some of the ailments people are now having. This is why we are working with the state and driving strong advocacies on preservation of aquatic lives and prevention of underground water activities that will cause its pollution like the discharge of hazardous waste materials,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "CITAD calls for sustainable community networks to bridge digital divide in Nigeria",
          "text": "The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) has called for commitments towards the establishment and sustaining of community networks, to help bridge the digital divide, across the country.\n\nCITAD made this call at a press conference in Lagos, where it listed efforts made on identifying and cultivating local champions to influence and support the community networks.\n\nRead the statement in full: The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) conducted a number of programmes toward supporting ICTs and specifically, advocating for the establishment and sustaining of community networks across the country.\n\nRecently, the centre organized meetings with friends of community networks, the CSOs and with larger stakeholders on identification and cultivating local champions to influence and support the community networks.\n\nJointly, CITAD and the Association for Progressive Communication (APC), a South Africa based group sharing same ideals with CITAD, drafted a Regulatory Framework for Community Networks in Nigeria (CNRF). This will soon be presented to the Honorable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy for action.\n\nToday, the international dimension of the digital divide remains a major point of the global struggle for justice. This requires both developed and developing countries to work together to address it. But, the internal dimension of the digital divide is what we as citizens and as a country can and should address.\n\nIn the present context, the certainty of the internal division of the digital divide is routinely acknowledged by the government and its agencies.\n\nBy government statistics, only about half of Nigerians have access to the internet. This means that within the country, an estimated population of 100 million people is already left behind and excluded from the benefits of the internet. To buttress this point, we can provide a few illustrations for you to understand how those who are left behind from the benefits of digital technology are left behind:\n\nAccess to some special interventions through financial institutions:\n\nIn many instances, people especially those at the community level often lose many opportunities provided especially on access to loans or other facilities. We all know that many financial institutions provide support with some conditions such as (provision of email addresses, etc) which lots of citizens, especially rural communities, don\u2019t have.\n\nThe second is about National Identity. For years now, the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, has been trying to issue National Identity Cards to Nigerians and up till now, less than half of Nigerians have been able to enrol. The major reason is that because it is IT-based and people in rural areas where internet infrastructure is lacking find it difficult to be enrolled. Such people are \u201cidentity excluded\u201d. They will even face problems when travelling.\n\nThe third is about education. Today all those who wish to access higher education, have to sit and pass the computer-based examination of JAMB. For many communities, their children graduate from Secondary Schools without using the computer until they enter the JAMB examination hall. Clearly, they are disadvantaged and often get blocked out from the education system at that stage.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons for the digital divide but one of those related to the model of technology rollout we use. In Nigeria, as in many other countries, technology rollout is market-driven, meaning that companies are willing to invest in infrastructure for connectivity only for areas where profits are assured and they are unlikely to invest in poor communities or communities that are sparsely populated that the telecommunication traffic cannot support profitably\n\n\u201cWhile this is not unique to Nigeria, many countries have solved the problem by deploying other models of rollout such as community networks to compliment market-driven rollout.\n\n\u201cCommunity networks are telecommunication infrastructure designed, deployed and managed by communities to meet their communication need. Globally these community networks are helping many countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico to address the internal dimensions of their digital divide.\n\n\u201cCommunity networks have failed to take roots in Nigeria because we do not have a national policy to guide their emergence and provide a supportive environment for communities to leverage various opportunities to bridge the connectivity gaps. The Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF) has said there are 114 communities where GSM signals are either weak or not at all.\n\n\u201cThese are called underserved and unserved communities. These communities could, if there is a policy that would provide clear rules for interconnectivity, frequency and spectrum allocation and use, etc, could mobilize their own resources and create their communication infrastructure to address their need.\n\n\u201cCITAD has, in the last eight months, been engaging the policymakers, especially the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, the telecommunication regulators, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and other stakeholders in the country such as NITDA, USPF and Galaxy Backbone with the aim of arriving at a consensus on developing a national policy for community networks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all agreed on its desirability, noting that community networks will help greatly in accelerating efforts of the government to address the digital divide and to prime the country to achieve its digital transformation agenda.\u201d\n\nWe would like to use this conference to specifically remind all actors to match their commitments with action. In particular, CITAD would like to:\n\n1. Call on the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure full implementation of the draft National Policy on Community Networks\n\n2. Enjoin the Galaxy Backbone PLC to provide communities with access to its backbone for them to use as their community networks getaways\n\n3. The USPF to support the upgrading of the many communities\u2019 digital centres they set up in the country to serve as basis of community networks for communities that desirous and passionate to set up such in their communities\n\n4. Demand on NCC to develop guidelines and regulations for the operation of community networks in the country and to allow communities to access and use TV White Space (TVWS) for the purposes of setting up community networks\n\n5. NITDA to work with communities at grassroots level to drive digital literacy which is critical for the effective utilization of digital technology and which is the foundation upon which the digital transformation agenda of the country will rest.\n\n6. Urge the CSOs to sustain evidence-based advocacy for the establishment of CNs across the country\n\n7. Call on the private sector operators to as, part of their corporate social responsibility support communities to set up community networks\n\n8. Call on all other stakeholders, including political office holders to support communities to go digital as critical contribution to community development.\n\n9. Call on private sector operators to see community networks as complimentary but not competitors",
          "summary": "The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) has called for commitments towards the establishment and sustaining of community networks, to help bridge the digital divide, across the country.\nRecently, the centre organized meetings with friends of community networks, the CSOs and with larger stakeholders on identification and cultivating local champions to influence and support the community networks.\nJointly, CITAD and the Association for Progressive Communication (APC), a South Africa based group sharing same ideals with CITAD, drafted a Regulatory Framework for Community Networks in Nigeria (CNRF).\nToday, the international dimension of the digital divide remains a major point of the global struggle for justice.\nGlobally these community networks are helping many countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico to address the internal dimensions of their digital divide.",

I think they have a serious task but I trust Abdullahi Adamu, he will do justice to that\u201d.\n\nOn the ability of the new APC leadership to meet the yearnings of party members, Nwosu expressed confidence that Adamu has what it takes to deliver.\n\nHe said, \u201cSenator Abdulahhi Adamu is a no-nonsense person right from when he was a minister to when he was a governor, he is not a man that somebody will hijack or as governor you can convince him on why you should have the structure in your state all to yourself, meanwhile there are other leaders, Abdullahi Adamu, I believe is a man of integrity who won\u2019t be sentimental in resolving political issues, the best they can do is to go into reconciliation and after that we can have a united APC\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the crisis in the Imo State chapter of the party, Nwosu said,\u201dthe best that will happen between governor Hope Uzodinma\u2019s camp and Owelle Rochas Okorocha\u2019s camp, which is where I belong and that of Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, is harmonization and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nA\u00e7cording to him,\u201dif they miss this opportunity, it is going to be a serious issue in Imo State in 2023 because all these groups will be divided.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn issue of election you can\u2019t say one person does not matter, you remember what happened in Anambra State governorship election, even one vote was important, so one vote from Okorocha or Ararume or Uzodinma is important to win election, what we\u2019re talking about is winning election, the issue of fight, fight, fight should be over,\n\n\u201cI think Governor Hope Uzodinma should extend the hand of brotherhood to Okorocha and Ararume because peace is not to go to a national television to say you\u2019re at peace with your brother when can\u2019t see your brother, so we have to make it real and something that will work and not just media statements to make people think there is peace. As far as we are",

          "text": "By: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, National Inland Waterways Authority, Dr George Moghalu has sought the support of the Nigerian Navy to boost water transportation and movement of cargo to enhance trade.\n\nMoghalu who stated this when he visited the Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo in Abuja, said the visit was to request support from the Navy to provide security for the movement of cargo on Nigeria waters.\n\nHe said \u201cI will stand bold enough to tell you that waterway transportation is the way to go. So, what we need to do, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, is to get people to key into this narrative. To key into our vision of making waterways transportation a transport of choice and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cBecause it is only the importers that tell you how he wants the goods to be moved, he can insist I want to move by land. so, you need to convince him of the alternative to move it by water.\n\n\u201cBut what is for us to do, we need to put the infrastructure in place, making sure that we have safe passage, making sure that the baggies are available, making sure that the goods and the baggies are all insured so that nobody will have anyone to blame at the end of the day. So, these are basic things we are trying to put in order,\u201d.\n\nMoghalu said the nation will gain a lot from water transportation but lamented challenges inhibiting its development.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot Nigerians stand to gain because by the time we start moving cargo by water. I\u2019m one of those that have said from the point of my appointment if there\u2019s any legacy I want to make, is to make water transportation, a transport means of choice both for cargo and national transportation.\n\n\u201cTo achieve that, we require the support of the navy to provide the needed Security for us to be able to move cargo from point A to point B and that has been the major concern of most of the importers who are aligning with us, who are collaborating with us to make sure that we bring into reality, this project we want to do.\n\nFurthermore, he said \u201cWe also have other collaborative relationships like the issue I mentioned before, the hydrography. For example, now there\u2019s a collaboration between NIWA,, the Nigerian navy and the NEXIM bank on carrying out the survey from the River Benue down to Burutu River, through Onitsha. It has to do with the movement of cargo within Nigerian territory\u201d.\n\nHe said insecurity remains a major challenge to water transportation noting, \u201cYes, we have the NIWA Police, we have the marine police, but one thing I can also give credit to is that in this government everybody is concerned, the issue of insecurity is not a personal business\u201d.\n\n\u201d It is all our business, every agency is committed to it and our Nigerian Navy has been quite supportive, the army, everybody has been quite supportive to make sure we have a safe operative environment\u201d",

Since to be forewarned is to be forearmed, we remind the Ministry of works that the whole settlement has a \u2018C of O\u2019 and this should be respected.\n\n\u201cNigerian Muslims will not fold their arms and watch one of the products of its hard labour disappear in rubles more so since the Islamic City is situated between two Christian entities, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Camp and the Deeper Life Bible Church Camp. MURIC will ensure that Nigerian Muslims resist this with every legitimate means at their disposal.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Church leadership has also been fingered as having an interest in evicting the Islamic City from its environs.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of plotting another round of EndSARS protest and peddling lies about the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed told a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, that though there is nothing wrong in having a viable opposition, the PDP went too far in seeking the country\u2019s destruction through its utterances and actions.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nIn its reaction to the weekend national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in Abuja, at the weekend, where a new National Working Committee of the party was elected, a day after, the PDP, in a statement by the its spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, the party said it was \u201cappalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievements were being made.\u201d\n\nBut, the Federal Government accused the PDP of advocating the destruction of Nigeria by threatening to unleash another round of EndSARS on the country and deliberately misinforming Nigerians on the APC government.\n\n\u201c\u2026As you know, the folks on the other side have been doing everything in recent times to overheat the polity, distort the achievements of our Administration and spread misinformation. Yes, it is very cold out there for the hungry and desperate opposition, but every indication is that they don\u2019t even want to wait for the 2023 elections before testing their popularity or acceptability at the polls.\n\n\u201cHow else does one explain their court case seeking the declaration of our convention as illegal? How do you explain their threat of another EndSARS that pushed Nigerian to the brink? How do you explain their glaring misinformation regarding the nation\u2019s state of affairs?\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in having a fiery and viable opposition in a democracy. We were there before and we remain the ones to beat in terms of a determined, viable and relentless opposition. But, in our time, not once did we advocate the destruction of Nigeria just because we couldn\u2019t have our way. Not once did we seek to gain power via a desperate court action. If you destroy the country you are seeking to govern, what country will you govern? Must you cut your nose to spite your face?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cIn their most recent act of desperation, they sought to erase seven years of unprecedented achievements by the Buhari Administration. In the most egregious show of shamelessness and a blatant refusal to be remorseful, they even had the audacity to express righteous indignation that the damage they inflicted on the country in their 16 years of misrule has not been totally undone in just seven years. In other words, those who brought the country to its knees are now accusing those working hard to repair things of non-performance. They said they are ready to rescue Nigeria. Pray, where do kidnappers rescue their victims? These same guys who kidnapped the fortunes of their country are suddenly posing as rescuers. Caveat Emptor; buyers beware! Nigerians beware!\u201d government said.\n\nThe minister dismissed the opposition party\u2019s claim that the PDP government handed over $550 billion economy, with single digit inflation and a much reduced debt profile.\n\n\u201cAsk them what infrastructure did they leave behind? Ask them how many motorable roads did they leave behind? They frittered away our gains from oil sales. How many times, on paper, did they launch the second Niger Bridge? How many times did they launch reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on paper?\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that opposition should not critique. What we are saying is that they should not promote anarchy because we didn\u2019t do that in our time. They wrecked the the economy and we are rebuilding it. They wrecked the country\u2019s infrastructure and we are rebuilding them?\u2026When PDP left, 21 states could not pay the salary of their staff. They should stop re-writing history while we are alive..\u201d\n\nAsked if he was satisfied that the APC government has ameliorated the sufferings of Nigerians, in light of the present economic situation in the country, Mohammed replied: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of this administration\u2019s efforts to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians. Before we came, there was nothing like the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP).\n\n\u201cThey gloat that Nigerians are suffering under our watch. But we say that while they laid the ground work for today\u2019s suffering with their mismanagement of national resources at a time of plenty, we have introduced unprecedented measures to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians, especially the very vulnerable. Our NSIP is the biggest of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. The N-Power benefits one million people; the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), has benefitted four million people; the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is providing quality meals daily to 10 million primary school pupils, in addition to empowering over 100,000 cooks and the same number of small holder farmers in the local areas where the schools are located; the Household Uplifting Programme (HUP), which has the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) as its flagship intervention, provides N5,000 monthly grants to almost 2 million eligible households across the country, in addition addition to the 1 million Urban Poor who are benefitting from the Conditional Cash Transfers, under the directive of Mr. President to further expand the programme due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.\u201d\n\nOn the double digit inflation raving the economy, the minister noted that, \u201c inflation is a global issue. On petrol scarcity: if only they did the needful (in overhauling infrastructure), we would have been benefitting from increase in crude oil prices today.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Sunday Aborisade, Emameh Gabriel, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kan\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the unity of purpose displayed by the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at its national convention on Saturday was indicative of the party\u2019s promising success in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nBuhari congratulated the newly elected APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the 79-member National Executive Committee (NEC) elected at the convention. But he blamed the media for reporting imaginary division within the ranks of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nAdamu, who emerged through a consensus arrangement, also took a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his acceptance speech, saying the opposition party is sad and disappointed at the success of the ruling party\u2019s national convention. He spoke yesterday after the new National Working Committee (NWC) of APC was sworn in.\n\nThe new national chairman argued that PDP and other opposition elements had expected to make a political fortune from an anticipated crisis-ridden convention. He said the ruling party had fulfilled its covenant with Nigerians.\n\n\n\nThe accusation came as Adamu\u2019s strongest rival and former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, also said the successful convention had put APC\u2019s enemies and naysayers to shame.\n\nSimilarly, Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola said at the weekend that the successful outcome of Saturday\u2019s national convention of APC was proof that the party would remain in power beyond 2023.\n\n\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Ou; his Ekiti State counterpart, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; and President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, congratulated Adamu and other members of the new NWC as well as the zonal executives of APC on their election.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP leadership, yesterday, mocked APC for allegedly imposing as its chairman a man arraigned in court on 149-count charge bordering on fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\nHowever, Buhari, in a release by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, stressed that the intraparty unity display during the convention had put the ruling party on a firmer footing for victory in the forthcoming general election.\n\nThe president returned to the convention ground at Eagle Square, Saturday morning, along with the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the senate president, to witness and celebrate the inauguration of the newly elected party executives. He said the smooth conduct of the election had raised the prospect of a mouth-watering APC victory next year.\n\n\n\nBuhari stated in the release, \u201cThe APC convention hosted this weekend sets the scene for an APC victory in the presidential and general elections next year. It is a victory over naysayers, who believed the party was divided but are now disappointed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is equally a victory for the president who has ensured unity across all party positions; and it is a victory for the voters of Nigeria, who can now be assured of a smooth succession to new leadership in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhat the convention made clear was how the media has been peddling fake news of division, when the hard reality of unity, cohesion, and, indeed, personal warmth between members of the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 was evident for all to see.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the blame for this mindset ought rightly to go to the opposition, who in all these years had done the work to only divide the country, leading to all manner of separatist agitations. But this is not the wish, nor is it in the character of the citizens, as was clear for everyone to see at the Eagle Square.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen their fake news of disunity was undone by the facts, some in the opposition could not help themselves but take to the newspapers and the airwaves to find another way to shore up their reputations. That some of the APC\u2019s new leadership were once in the opposition was the new line to take to the media, somehow suggesting that those who have left one party should not hold positions in another. Yet, do the Scriptures not teach us of the virtue of sinners who repent and change their ways?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways. Given that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute. It is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year, when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt, some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the good voters of Nigeria can see through such acrobatics and know the facts that, when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking after he was sworn in, Adamu said, \u201cAs we conclude this very successful convention of our great party, I know that our opponents in PDP and other opposition parties are now sulking, wearing long faces of sadness, bewilderment and dismay.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey had been hoping and praying to make a fortune out of our misfortunes. They were also hoping and praying to capitalise on assumed failures of our party to reap political benefits.\u201d\n\nAdamu, who emerged through a consensus arrangement after all the other six contestants were prevailed upon to step down, pleaded with all aspirants to \u201cshow maturity and good sportsmanship and accept the outcome of this convention with grace.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stressed that even though they did not achieve their ambitions at the convention, a good number of them would still serve the party and the country in several other positions of responsibility.\n\nThe APC national chairman said, \u201cWe are, however, satisfied that APC has fulfilled its covenant with the Nigerian people. Of the three main pillars of its promises to the Nigerian people in 2015, that is, security, economy and anti-corruption, much progress has been recorded in all three areas and many more.\n\n\u201cAPC is set to do much, much more when Nigerians continue to bestow on us their love, support and confidence in next year\u2019s general election.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu said no administration had the record of APC in the provision of critical infrastructure, which was hitherto considered impossible in the country. He listed such projects to include \u201cthe Second Niger Bridge, complete rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ibadan dual carriageway, the Lagos-Ibadan express rail, the Abuja-Kaduna express light rail, the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano pipeline\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu took the oath of office and oath of allegiance at 12:22pm yesterday at an event witnessed by Buhari, Osinbajo, Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Attorney General the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubkar Malami, governors, and other members of the party.\n\nHe called on all aggrieved members of APC to put their differences aside and work for the interest of the party.\n\nAdamu thanked the president and leaders of the party at all levels, as well as members of the party nationwide for electing them into offices of responsibility and promised to discharge his duty with diligence.\n\n\n\nHe said while he acknowledged the onerous responsibility that had been placed on their shoulders as an executive, they would work hard to ensure that expectations were met and the party was not disappointed.\n\nTo those, who lost in the contest, Adamu said, \u201cI wish to also congratulate the great party men and women, who also aspired to occupy these national offices of our great party. They did not succeed this time but in God\u2019s time, many of them will yet realise their ambitions to serve our party and country in many other positions of responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs politicians, we are not strangers to gains, losses and disappointments with the outcome of every political contest. Let us show maturity and good sportsmanship and accept the outcome of this convention with grace. Our party needs all hands on the steering wheel so that together we can steer the ship of state through the inclement weather of our divisive national politics to the promised land.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe charged APC members to renew their faith in the party and its leadership at all levels and remain patriotic.\n\nOn reconciliation, he said, \u201cWe need to commit to the resolution of our crisis within the confines of our party constitution. We must resist the temptation to blow every minor personal disagreement into a major party crisis. It is time for us to do things differently. When we quarrel, we open our flanks to our rival political parties that are only too eager to exploit them for their own benefit.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you here and now that we shall heal any wounds in our party; we shall effect lasting reconciliation among our members, and we shall go into the next general election as a strong and united party. I offer my hands of friendship to all our members. I want to assure you that my colleagues and myself will run an open-door policy to all members of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, let us rise and march towards the sunrise in our party and in our country. The time has come for us to show statesmanship to arrive at the new dawn. The time has come for us to be patriotic in words and deeds. The time has come for us to affirm our being the party of the people, for the people and by the people.\u201d\n\nHe urged the media to address the tone, content, and standard of reporting, appealing to them to take a cue from the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Malam Abubakar Imam, Alhaji Alade Odunewu and other media pioneers, who upheld \u201cthe patriotic spirit of the founding fathers of their profession.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu, a founding member of PDP, two-term PDP governor of Nasarawa State, and secretary, Board of Trustees of the PDP, before emerging senator under the PDP, defected to the APC at the twilight of the ex-President Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2014.\n\nThe new National Secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore, was also a PDP senator for Osun East from 2003 to 2011.\n\n\n\nThe list of politicians with PDP foundation in control at the APC NWC is long and include Festus Fuanter (Plateau State), Deputy National Secretary; Muazu Bawa Rjau (Niger State), National Vice Chairman, North-central; Mustapha Salihu (Adamawa State), National Vice Chairman, North-east; Barr Ahmed El-Marzuk (Katsina State), National Legal Adviser; Uguru Matthew Ofoka (Ebonyi State), National Treasurer; Senator Abubakar Maikafi (Bauchi State), National Auditor; Dr Betta Edu (Cross River State), National Women Leader; Barr F.N. Nwosu (Abia State), National Welfare Secretary; and Nze Chidi Duru (Anambra State), Deputy National Organising Secretary.\n\nJigawa State Governor and chairman of the convention committee, Bello Matawalle, said, five positions were contested out of the 35 national officers and only few on the zonal level, out of the whole 78 positions.\n\nAlmakura, Salihu Mustapha, Mohammed Etsu, Abdulaziz Yari, Sani Muhammed, and George Akume were the six chairmanship aspirants, who stepped down for Adamu after a consensus agreement was reached just hours before the convention proper.\n\nAl-Makura: We Disappointed Naysayers, Enemies\n\nFormer Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, said APC disappointed naysayers and put the enemies of the party to shame with the successful conduct of its national convention. Al-Makura, in a statement, congratulated Adamu, who emerged new national chairman of the party.\n\n\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn displaying our first-rate problem-solving, dispute resolution, and organisational aptitude through a rancour-free and smooth national convention, our party has, once again, disappointed the naysayers and put the enemies of the party to shame.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the national convention done and dusted, I have no doubt that our great party is now well-repositioned and good to go into the 2023 elections with confidence, as I have no doubt that the new leadership has all it takes to navigate our party to victory in 2023 and beyond.\u201d\n\nOyetola: Successful Outing is Proof We\u2019ll Remain in Power Beyond 2023\n\nOsun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, at the weekend, said the successful outcome of Saturday\u2019s national convention of APC was proof that the party would remain in power beyond 2023. Oyetola was happy everything went well, despite negative expectations of pessimists\n\n\n\nHe expressed confidence in the ability of the new National Secretary of the party and representative of Osun State in the National Working committee (NWC), Senator Iyiola Omisore, to deliver, even as he congratulated the party\u2019s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\n\nThe Osun State governor, who said the peaceful conduct of the convention was a sign that the ruling party was united, formidable and remained indivisible, also held the view that Adamu would bring his wealth of experience to bear in the administration and management of the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nOyetola, in a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Ismail Omipidan, expressed confidence in the existing unity in APC. With this he said the party would remain in power beyond 2023, by the grace of God, and thanked Buhari for providing the right leadership.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cFirst of all, I must thank our leaders in the South-west for their support for our own Senator Iyiola Omisore. This is a great thing for us in Osun APC and I must thank other contestants for conceding and accepting to withdraw from the race.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend them for the bold step, just as I assure them of our support in their time of need. I have no doubt in the capacity of Otunba Omisore to deliver and take our party to a greater level.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, the peaceful atmosphere here and the seamless conduct of the convention, is a testimony to the strong unity that exists in our party. It is an attestation to the fact that we have our ways of resolving issues without necessarily resorting to conflict.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to the negative expectations of some people, the convention went peacefully. The security operatives have done wonderfully well. I am really proud of what has happened today (Saturday). It is a sign that our party is united, formidable and remains indivisible.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn achieving all these, I must personally commend the leadership quality provided by President Muhammadu Buhari, who always advocates harmony and peace in the party. It is natural to have disagreement, but what is important is the ability to have a workable mechanism to resolve any crisis without necessarily resorting to rancour.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpressing in confidence in the ability of Omisore to deliver and contribute to the growth of the party through his new position, the governor said Omisore would deploy his political sagacity, leadership qualities and experience, which he acquired in public and private sectors, towards building a virile and healthy party at the centre.\n\nSanwo-Olu Congratulates New Party Leadership\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, congratulated the newly elected national chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and other members of the NWC as well as zonal executives of the ruling party. Sanwo-Olu charged the Adamu-led NWC to work tirelessly with APC leaders and stakeholders to make the ruling party stronger for it to retain power in 2023 at the federal level and win more states in addition to the 22 states currently governed by the party.\n\n\n\nThe governor commended Buhari for his fatherly and leadership role in ensuring that that APC national and zonal executives emerged through a consensus arrangement. He noted that many aspirants, especially, the national chairmanship aspirants, stepped down, because of the respect they had for Buhari and other leaders of the party.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who was excited with the outcome of the convention, also commended the aspirants, who voluntarily stepped down for members of the NWC and zonal executives at the six geo-political zones to emerge through a consensus arrangement.\n\n\n\nSanwo-Olu, who was Chairman, Finance Committee for the APC National Convention, praised over 7,000 delegates from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, for participating in the convention.\n\n\n\nHe also congratulated the representatives of Lagos State in the National Working Committee (NWC), Mr. Dayo Israel, who was elected APC National Youth Leader as well as former Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Lateef Ibirogba, who emerged South-west Zonal Organising Secretary.\n\nThe governor implored the new executives to work hard with APC national, zonal and state executives, as well as party leaders and members for victory of the ruling party in Lagos State, South-west and Nigeria, at large, during the 2023 general election.\n\nFayemi Rejoices With Adamu, Others, Lauds Buni on Successful Tenure\n\nEkiti State Governor and Chairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, congratulated the newly elected national executives of APC under the chairmanship of former Nassarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on their emergence at the party\u2019s just concluded national convention.\n\n\n\nFayemi lauded the APC national caretaker committee headed by Yobe State Governor, Mai Malla Buni, for organising a successful national convention aimed at strengthening the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement shortly after the new executives were inaugurated, Fayemi said he was happy the party\u2019s convention held successfully, despite initial anxieties, divergent interests and opinions of members over what they considered the best way moving forward.\n\n\n\nHe congratulated Adamu, the national Secretary, Omisore, and other elected NWC members, whose elections were ratified at the convention, and wished them success in the task of repositioning APC as the undisputable number one political party in the country with attendant electoral fortunes.\n\n\n\nHe urged the new national officers to look beyond the various opposition expressed by individuals or groups to their aspirations ahead of the convention, saying it is normal in any democratic setting. He urged the new executives to hit the ground running by reaching out to aggrieved party members and running an inclusive administration.\n\nLawan: Integrity, Experience Earned Adamu APC Chairmanship\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, while congratulating Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as the new national chairman of APC, said integrity and experience earned him the position.\n\nLawan, in a congratulatory message on Sunday, reiterated that Adamu\u2019s victory at the national convention was a testimony to the tremendous respect he enjoyed across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\n\n\nLawan said, \u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on his emergence as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the just concluded National Convention of our great party.\n\n\u201cThe unanimous affirmation of Senator Adamu\u2019s candidature at the convention is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity. I share this common belief in his suitability for piloting the affairs of our great party from this very important juncture.\n\n\u201cSenator Adamu\u2019s antecedents as a political leader and astute administrator show that our party has made a great choice in his election as our National Chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe senate president also congratulated other members of the newly inaugurated NWC and zonal officers of the party on their elections and urged them all to do their best to deliver their mandates and live up to the great expectations of the teeming members of APC across and outside of Nigeria.\n\nThe senate president said the people of Yobe State were extremely proud of Buni for his achievements while he was chairman of the CECPC of the APC.\n\nGbajabiamila: We Remain One Big Family\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, said the way things turned out at the convention were proof the party remained one big family. Gbajabiamila said this while congratulating Adamu on his emergence as chairman at the party\u2019s national convention on Saturday.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila also congratulated other elected members of the party\u2019s NWC, such as Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Otunba Iyiola Omisore and the six vice chairmen, among others.\n\n\n\nThe Speaker, in a congratulatory message, reiterated that Adamu\u2019s emergence through a consensus arrangement proved that APC was one big family, where its members resolved their differences amicably.\n\nHe, however, tasked the new chairman and the other members of the NWC to put heads together to transform the party ahead of the 2023 general elections, He expressed optimism in the ability of Adamu and his NWC members to rally round APC members and other Nigerians to take the party to victory.\n\nYahaya Excited over Convention Outcome, Hails Buhari\n\nGombe State Governor, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, expressed excitement over the outcome of the party\u2019s national convention, which elected former Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Adamu, as National Chairman. Yahaya also hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for provided the much-needed leadership.\n\nIn a statement issued by his Director General, Press Affairs, Ismaila Uba Misilli, the governor also felicitated with other national and zonal officers of the APC, who were elected.\n\n\n\nInuwa, particularly, praised the leadership, direction, and guidance of Buhari, which, he said, facilitated the consensus arrangement that produced the leaders of APC.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe maturity displayed at the convention has demonstrated the spirit of unity of purpose and strong will of our members as well as indivisiblity of the force of our great party.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial appreciation must go to our leader and amiable President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for providing leadership and guidance that saw to the successful and rancour-free conduct of the convention.\n\n\n\nThe governor also praised the caretaker/extraordinary national convention planning committee, headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, for successfully superintending over the affairs of APC within the period of its stewardship and for strengthening unity, understanding and camaraderie among party faithful.\n\nWe\u2019re Equal to the Task, Says Ganduje\n\nKano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje said the party had the necessary capability to succeed in the conduct of its national convention. In a statement yesterday, Ganduje said the exercise had made the party more united and stronger.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we are sure we are equal to the task. It is also a great success if you look at the procedures followed in order to come up with this exercise. I know you are aware that President Muhammadu Buhari has advised us to go on consensus,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\n\n\nTo effectively comply with Buhari\u2019s advice, the governor said, \u201cWe undertook a lot of consensus in this exercise.\u201d\n\nHe explained that in areas where consensus did not work, they had to go into election with all the proper procedures for election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can see that they have counted votes and some announcements were made. Winners have already emerged as winners,\u201d he said.\n\nGanduje appreciated that at the end of the exercise, \u201cWe have come up with a new brand of leadership.\u201d\n\nYour Chairman is Battling Alleged Corruption, Opposition Mocks\n\nPDP, yesterday, mocked APC over its choice of Abdullahi Adamu as national chairman, saying he is battling corruption allegation. The opposition party said Adamu had been arraigned in court on a 149-count charge of alleged fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\n\n\nPDP described the APC event as a convention of lies, celebration of illegality, corruption and arrogance in failure, adding that any leadership birthed through such process can only be overtly corrupt, debauch and illegal.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said it was clear that with the combination of the corrupt, deceitful and rudderless Buhari-led APC government and the illegitimate Adamu-led party leadership, corruption, economic hardship and rudderless movement in the APC government would worsen in the country in the remaining one year of the APC in government.\n\n\n\nPDP said the composition of the APC national leadership was a clear confirmation that Buhari had never been committed to the fight against corruption as well as his willingness to further open the national vaults to ravenous treasury looters in APC.\n\nIt challenged members of the APC national leadership, particularly, Adamu, to come clean on corruption charges against them.\n\n\n\nPDP stated, \u201cThe new APC chairman should inform Nigerians why he was not courageous enough to submit himself to trial at the Federal High Court, Lafia, Nasarawa State, rather than hide under technicalities. Senator Adamu should, therefore, come clean to Nigerians on the said case before parading himself as a saint.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, pathetic to see Senator Adamu showboating on stage to impress his puppet master by attempting to denigrate other Nigerians and our great party, the PDP.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur party has only pity for Senator Adamu and does not intend to confer him an undue relevance with a response. Senator Adamu should, however, be conscious of the fact that time does not run against the state in criminal matters. He should, therefore, not have any illusion that being an APC chairman will avail him a perpetual cover.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was appalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievement were being made.\n\n\u201cIs it not shameful that while APC leaders were lying on stage in Abuja, terrorists were busy attacking the Kaduna International Airport, located in an APC-controlled state?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP, however, restated its cautions that the APC NWC did not have the legitimacy of office as the process that produced it under the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) remained unconstitutional and flawed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "At least three persons have been killed in an ongoing attack on Kabo Village in the Gurara Local Government Area of Niger State by armed Fulani herdsmen.\n\nThe suspected terrorists, SaharaReporters reliably gathered, arrived in the community in large numbers on Monday afternoon, shooting sporadically in different directions.\n\nMost residents of the village were said to have been hit by bullets while fleeing into nearby bushes for safety.\n\nA resident of the town told SaharaReporters that the casualty figure is expected to rise further by the end of the day, adding that the herdsmen were still operating in the village.\n\n\u201cThey (Fulani herdsmen) arrived this afternoon and started shooting at houses and anyone in sight.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, three people have been killed.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Okubanjo to step back from people decisions at Bento Africa",
          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nEurope appears to be gearing up for some interesting times with its new Digital Markets Act. The law aims to allow smaller messaging platforms to access the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the messaging world.\n\nIf it ends up getting implemented by October, this could mean that messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and iMessage could become interoperable.\n\nBasically, you might be able to send messages on WhatsApp to someone on Telegram or unlike the current exclusive use case of the iMessage platform, from iMessage to Facebook Messenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t get too excited yet, though. According to The Verge, \u201cthe language in the press release is unclear on whether the big apps would have to work together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, today I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nRide-sharing newcomer\u2019s launch in Lagos, and\n\nThe correlation between Right of Way charges and Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\nHytch launches in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, during my compulsory national youth service, to save transportation costs, I hitchhiked part of the way to my office. Not the safest option, but certainly one of the cheapest. Basically, I stood by the side of the road and hailed strange cars going in the same direction I was going.\n\nUnfortunately, due to some stern African parent \u2014 I feel this phrase is tautological \u2014 warnings, I couldn\u2019t continue.\n\nFor Laolu Onifade, the journey to hitchhiking was a little different. Borne out of unpleasant experiences with ride-hailing companies, he got three other friends to join in his desire to build a ride-sharing platform that connects drivers and riders going in the same direction.\n\nOn Friday, March 25, 2022, Hytch \u2014 Onifade\u2019s ride-sharing platform \u2014 was publicly launched and currently operates in Lagos State.\n\nBut how does Onifade hope to ensure user safety and prevent stern African parent warnings? I spoke with him a few days ago, and among other things, we discussed Hytch\u2019s safety measures and plans.\n\nYou can find it here: Ride-sharing newcomer, Hytch is providing a new way to travel, hitchhiking style\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight of Way charges disrupt Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting news: On Friday, March 25, 2022, the Nigerian Federal Government directed state governors to remove Right of Way (RoW) barriers to fast-track the expansion and strengthen the national grid.\n\nWhy? According to the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, issues with RoW has stalled 32 transmission projects across Nigeria worth $137 million.\n\nAn age-long problem: Before now, the federal government has made some inroads into challenges surrounding RoW charges. In 2017, the National Executive Council (NEC), approved a policy, which resulted in an RoW Charge Agreement reached with all the governors of the 36 states of Nigeria.\n\nThis agreement was meant to harmonise charges across board but has yet to materialise enough changes in the system with some states increasing their tariffs.\n\nRoW charges affect the overall amount telcos spend in laying optic fibre and eventually affect the cost of calls and Internet data. Now, it appears it could also be affecting electricity transmission as well.\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen federal government directives on the issue, and it remains to be seen if any changes will occur.\n\nMeanwhile, for your reading pleasure: When calls and data could get cheaper for Nigerian states that slashed RoW charges\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nWoke up to Elton John\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart ringing in my head and went on an oldies path for the rest of the day.\n\nSome lessons on patience, albeit from a footballing perspective.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I understand the concept yet, but this video about understanding dimensions was an interesting watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s oil sector walked to a cliff\u2019s edge",
          "text": "Upon his appointment as the 18th Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in July 2019, Mele Kyari, set upon achieving a production target of 3 million barrels per day (bpd). For a country struggling to produce 1.4 million bpd, this seemed like an ambitious goal until you realise that the target in 1992 was to raise production to 4 million bpd.\n\nThe story of how Nigeria\u2019s sprawling oil industry \u2013 which once accounted for the highest foreign direct investments, which was the prime career choice for many bright children and the lubricant that oiled both infrastructure and sleaze \u2013 drifted to the edge of the cliff mirrors how Africa\u2019s biggest economy suffered a bruising fall.\n\n\u201cWithin the past 30 years I have been in the industry, the decline I have seen in the sector year after year was caused by not putting the right people in the right places,\u201d said Udeimoh Itseuli, a former chairman of NNPC and chairman of Dubril Oil Company Limited, an indigenous operator.\n\nItseuli told BusinessDay that in the early days of oil production in the 1970s when Nigerians began to acquire technical skills, those who wrote government regulations and worked in NNPC were experienced professionals with technical competence, having worked in the private sector.\n\nAnalysts say the skill level has since dropped significantly. Despite being one of the largest producers on the continent, Nigeria has no university that has built a strong research and innovation faculty to serve the oil industry.\n\nThe decline, they said, started with the influx of quacks with the \u2018right connections\u2019 or who came from the \u2018right part of the country\u2019.

          "text": "Upon his appointment as the 18th Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in July 2019, Mele Kyari, set upon achieving a production target of 3 million barrels per day (bpd). For a country struggling to produce 1.4 million bpd, this seemed like an ambitious goal until you realise that the target in 1992 was to raise production to 4 million bpd.\n\nThe story of how Nigeria\u2019s sprawling oil industry \u2013 which once accounted for the highest foreign direct investments, which was the prime career choice for many bright children and the lubricant that oiled both infrastructure and sleaze \u2013 drifted to the edge of the cliff mirrors how Africa\u2019s biggest economy suffered a bruising fall.\n\n\u201cWithin the past 30 years I have been in the industry, the decline I have seen in the sector year after year was caused by not putting the right people in the right places,\u201d said Udeimoh Itseuli, a former chairman of NNPC and chairman of Dubril Oil Company Limited, an indigenous operator.\n\nItseuli told BusinessDay that in the early days of oil production in the 1970s when Nigerians began to acquire technical skills, those who wrote government regulations and worked in NNPC were experienced professionals with technical competence, having worked in the private sector.\n\nAnalysts say the skill level has since dropped significantly. Despite being one of the largest producers on the continent, Nigeria has no university that has built a strong research and innovation faculty to serve the oil industry.\n\nThe decline, they said, started with the influx of quacks with the \u2018right connections\u2019 or who came from the \u2018right part of the country\u2019. They were given oil wells they didn\u2019t know how to develop and ran government agencies they were ill-prepared for.\n\nThis accounts for why the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) governing operation in deepwater, where most of Nigeria\u2019s oil is now produced, provided for reviews every five years or once oil price rose above the base price of $20 a barrel, but they failed to initiate any such review for decades.\n\nThe delay in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill created decades of uncertainty during which the International Oil Companies (IOCs) began to look elsewhere, and they held back investments.

          "text": "The reality of International Oil Companies\u2019 (IOCs) departure from the largest oil patch in Africa is ceding the space to independent companies \u2013 a development that will test Nigeria\u2019s ability to craft policies that will make its oil industry attractive for investments.\n\nOil industry professionals who spoke to BusinessDay said the decision to leave Nigeria had been taken years ago when it emerged that the country was crimping the space for operators.\n\nThey say Nigerian government officials\u2019 cavalier attitude towards industry operators, rampant crude theft and sabotage, inability to quickly enact regulatory and fiscal reforms, insecurity and disrespect for contract sanctity, and pressure exacted by climate change activists are some of the key factors driving the exodus of IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian oil industry from 2022 will be taken over by independents, whether they are Nigerian or foreign independents because the IOCs are not coming back,\u201d Uduimoh Itsueli, a former chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and chairman of Dubril Oil Company Ltd, said in an interview.\n\nItsueli, however, said the independents do not have the clout of the IOCs.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to craft the policies so that it can encourage these ones who do not have the same clout as the IOCs. We need to change how we do business. We need to grow our own independents,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria is doing the very opposite. The cash-strapped government is foraging for cash with a desperation that borders on mania, leading to rampant harassment of industry operators by various organs of government.\n\nIndigenous oil firms tell BusinessDay that various state governments, local government agencies, and lawmakers embark on revenue drives in the form of levies, new taxes, and constant demands for audits and documentation about companies\u2019 accounts with so much tenacity that it looks like a shakedown.\n\n\u201cSomebody sent a letter to our Benin office saying that we do not have a permit to produce water we use commercially. But we don\u2019t even have a water plant; we don\u2019t sell water. They wrote threatening to take action. We simply called their number to say we have a borehole for water we use internally. They said, \u2018Oh, write a letter to us to that effect,\u2019\u201d Itsueli said.\n\nThe same week the company received a letter from the National Assembly, requesting details of its transactions with the NNPC going back 20 years as well as bank records and the company\u2019s books. The committee wanted 20 copies of each and two flash drives as well as the company\u2019s officials to physically bring them to Abuja.\n\nHowever, Dubril Oil is a sole risk company with no transactions with the NNPC.\n\nItsueli said these were the sort of things that needed to change. While the IOCs have a large staff strength and huge departments and can respond to government officials\u2019 harassment, sometimes appealing to their ambassadors to intervene, the independents do not have such clout.\n\nRead also: IOCs lament threat to business as Nigeria loses $3.27bn to crude oil theft\n\nSince they are nimble and efficient, independents have small staff strength and even smaller tolerance for official ineptitude. A relapse to the old ways by the Nigerian government will trigger an exit faster than a 100 meters dash.\n\nDelay in granting approvals and taking decisions, a constant feature of the Nigerian government engagement with oil sector operators, (it took 22 years to write an oil law), sometimes weaponised to whip erring operators in line, will be a blunt tool after the exit of IOCs.\n\nFollowing plans for a new marginal field bid rounds, the erstwhile regulator, Department of Petroleum Resources, revoked the marginal fields awarded to seven firms, including Associated Oil & Gas Limited and Dansaki Petroleum Limited, operators of Tom Shot Bank Marginal Field; Bayelsa Oil Limited, operator of Atala Marginal Field; Independent Energy Limited, operator of Ofa Marginal Field; and Del-Sigma Petroleum Nigeria Limited, operator of Ke Marginal Field.\n\nOthers are Sogenal Energy Limited, operator of Akepo Marginal Field; Sahara Energy Limited and African Oil & Gas Limited, operators of Tsekelewu Marginal Field; Bicta Energy and Management Systems Ltd, operator of Ogedeh Marginal Field; and Goland Petroleum Limited, operator of Oriri Marginal Field.\n\nThe firms went to court and secured a judgment restraining the government from auctioning the fields they said they had invested over $100 million to develop.\n\nSince the judgment was secured in 2020, even after another bid round in 2021, the matter has remained unresolved.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters upon letters, but we have not heard anything,\u201d Aderele Afolabi, founder of Dansaki Petroleum Ltd, told BusinessDay. \u201cPlease keep me informed if you hear anything,\u201d he urged this reporter.\n\nIn a serious country, an investor would not ask a reporter the latest details about his investment with the government.\n\nPrior to Lekoil\u2019s corporate troubles, Lekan Akinyanmi, the company\u2019s CEO, had told BusinessDay that the greatest risk facing local oil firms was not raising capital, wasn\u2019t human resources, wasn\u2019t even community agitations but the slow pace of regulatory decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the government now is how to make the sector more attractive for investors, tackle vandalism in the Niger Delta and incentivise operators,\u201d said Adebowale Adeniyi, senior manager, Oil, Gas & Power Group at Andersen Tax.\n\nGovernment officials who shout themselves hoarse over ease of doing business, operators say, behave as if they get paid by how thorough they are in frustrating businesses.\n\nOperators say the tone of communication by government regulators and lawmakers with oversight over committees, many with scant knowledge of the sector they pretend to superintend, is often punitive, laced with threats.\n\nSome operators report an aversion for private companies reporting huge profits, forgetting that when private companies succeed, the economy gets bigger, they employ more people, pay more taxes, get involved in more Corporate Social Responsibility and relieve the government of some burden to focus on more urgent areas.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the just concluded 2022 Doha Forum in Qatar, showcased business and investment opportunities in Edo State, rallying investors to take advantage of the business-friendly environment as well as incentives provided by his administration in the state to invest in new frontiers.\n\nObaseki, who joined other world leaders and policymakers at the 20th edition of the forum, showcased investment opportunities in different sectors of the state\u2019s economy including agriculture, healthcare, technology and education, among others.\n\nNoting that the COVID-19 pandemic further opened opportunities for investment in the state, Obaseki said, \u201cThe pandemic drained the capital of small and medium scale businesses, but this opened an opportunity for investment because most of them began using technology. This, in turn, has boosted tech startups, and young people in that space are now making a living working for companies outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration has recorded huge success in opening up the space for investment through pragmatic reforms in the state\u2019s industrial corridors, and in infrastructure, education, healthcare and security.\n\nObaseki said the state is sustaining investment in large-scale agricultural production and leveraging technology and the innovative potential of its youthful population to ensure food security and drive the state\u2019s post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery plan.\n\nHe further noted, \u201cThe Ukrainian war, for me, has created a real alarm for our food systems. With the increase in food prices, particularly, wheat, staples and grains, and the rise in energy prices, we as a government, have realized that we now have to put a lot of resources and time into agriculture, and large-scale agricultural projects.\n\n\u201cFortunately, in Edo State, we have started investment in palm oil and have rolled out programmes where we could bring in serious investment into large scale oil palm production as the trigger for large scale investment in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the opportunities that we see in the next three years is to first secure our food supplies by food production and then utilize technology and focus on smaller businesses,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor further stated: \u201cFor us in Edo State, we didn\u2019t suffer much from the infections or mortality rate of the COVID-19 because of the very young population we have in Nigeria and Edo State. The infection wasn\u2019t so high and the mortality wasn\u2019t as bad as we get from malaria or other diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat really affected us was the disruption of livelihoods and with the lockdowns, a lot of small businesses were seriously affected and but the availability of technology as a response sprung up new opportunities for small businesses in particular.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our healthcare response, we realized the opportunities for investment in the healthcare space and the participation of the private sector in healthcare delivery. Before now, the bulk of healthcare investment was left to the government, even though the private sector is a key provider of healthcare services.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Experts warn against more debt amidst dwindling revenue",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nPlan by the federal government to add N6.3tn new debts to Nigeria\u2019s current debt stock, with little or no possibility of improvement in revenue is raising concerns of possible debt distress among economic experts.\n\nThe experts are kicking against the federal governments proclivity for debt, which they have described as unsustainable, calling for increased productivity with a view to boosting revenue.\n\nLast week, the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that the federal government has incurred N950bn new domestic borrowing between January 2022 and March 11, 2022.\n\nDisclosing the fresh borrowing in the presentation of the Public Debt Data as of December 31, 2021, the Director-General of the DMO, Mrs. Patience Oniha, revealed that the federal government was considering all options to raise funds externally.\n\nAccording to the document, the federal government still plans to borrow an additional N1.6tn, while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing is N2.57tn. There is also a plan to borrow N2.57tn from foreign creditors, while N1.16tn is expected from multilateral/bilateral drawdowns.\n\nIn total, the federal government plans to add N6.3tn new debts to the current debt stock, which would push the country\u2019s total debt stock to N45.86tn by December 2022.\n\nData from the DMO showed a rise in Nigerias total public debt from N32.92 trillion in 2020 to N39.56 trillion at the close of last year.\n\nA breakdown of the debt statistics as at December 31, 2020, showed that Nigeria owes International Development Association (IDA) $11.12 billion; Eurobonds ($10. 8 billion); IMF ($3.53 billion) and Exim Bank of China ($3.26 billion), among others.\n\nThe debt stock includes new borrowings by the federal government and sub-nationals. The borrowed funds are helping in financing the budget deficit, capital projects and support economic recovery, according to authorities.\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s current debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 22.47 per cent is relatively low, giving it room to borrow, its inability to generate adequate revenue has worsened its debt problem.\n\nThe debt to GDP ratio stood at 22.47 per cent compared to 21.61 per cent in 2020. At this level, the ratio is within Nigerias self-imposed limit of 40 per cent, the World Bank/IMFs recommended limit of 55 per cent for countries within Nigeria\u2019s peer group, and 70 per cent for ECOWAS countries.\n\nNigeria\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio has remained low at nine per cent compared to countries, such as Ghana at 12.5 per cent; Kenya at 16.6 per cent; Angola at 20.9 per cent; and South Africa at 25.2 per cent.\n\nAll options for raising funds externally are being considered. These include funding from multi later so and bilateral sources, the International Capital Markets and the $3.35bn Special Drawing Rights allocated by the International Monetary Fund to the Central Bank of Nigeria, Oniha had said in her presentation.\n\nIncidentally, IMF has expressed readiness to continue to grant credit facilities to Nigeria and other emerging economies within its membership, to economies protect them from losing their financial security or derailing from long-term financial goals.\n\nSpeaking during an online media parley in Washington DC, United States on Thursday, the IMF said the facilities would come through its financial safety nets. It reiterated the importance of strengthening global financial safety net, and ensuring that countries have access to support.\n\nIn the media parley transcript posted on its website, IMF called for actions to strengthen policy frameworks and reduce vulnerabilities in monetary policy, fiscal policy, and financial support for business.\n\n\u201cWe emphasise the importance of the global financial safety net, and countries having access to that as appropriate, including, of course, support from the IMF, which we stand ready to provide as needed by our membership,\u201d it said.\n\nReacting to the situation, an economist Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the country is on the brink of debt distress.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is on the brink of debt distress because our debt profile now is not sustainable. We had a debt service to revenue ratio getting to 76 per cent as of November last year. The situation is likely to get worse because our deficit in the 2022 budget is N6.4tn, and we need to borrow to finance the deficit.\n\n\u201cAlso, the federal government has submitted a supplementary budget proposal for subsidy for N2.55tn after the budget was passed. Adding that to the deficit, we will get about N9tn.\n\nHow much is the revenue? It is just about N10.7tn, and we are not likely to get the full revenue, maybe 70 per cent. So, we are getting to a point whereby the time we service our debts, which should be around N4tn, and spend another N4tn on subsidy this year, we have consumed almost all our revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cDoes that now mean that we are going to be using debt for personnel costs?; for overhead?; for capital budget? That is where we are heading to.\u201d\n\nYusuf, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), regretted that instead of the country gaining from the increase in oil price like other oil-producing countries, the government is losing money on fuel importation and fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWith the increase in oil price, the subsidy price will have to increase beyond what the NNPC requested. While other oil-producing companies are happy, as their reserves are increasing and currency are getting stronger, we are lamenting because we are not getting the full benefit of the oil windfall,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nOn his part, a professor of Economics, Sheriffdeen Tella, criticised the federal government for the rate of increasing debt, pointing out that the money spent on debt servicing is eating deep into the governments revenue, which makes borrowing an unsustainable form of financing.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are already in debt distress if we are spending a large proportion of our revenue on debt servicing, we are in trouble and our revenue is not growing. The Minister of Finance recently said we will borrow from Eurobonds to finance subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of economics is that? The Minister of Finance deserves to be given an award for patronising the debt market. She has made Nigeria the most active debtor in the world. This is not good enough.\n\n\u201cWe are already in distress in terms of debts because we are spending our revenue, which is declining, on debt servicing and fuel importation. It is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWhat is the money borrowed used for? Every time, we hear of things being underfunded. Even the NNPC said they are underfunded which is why they were unable to meet up with the OPEC quota for oil production. So, what really is funded in this country?\u201d he wondered.\n\nHe further urged the federal government to stop borrowing and focus on how to boost revenue, especially by removing the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe federal government needs to be stopped from borrowing money. They just borrow for consumption and not production. How can you borrow for subsidy on fuel when people are using more diesel?\u201d Tella queried.\n\n\u201cIndustries, trains, and trailers use diesel. Diesel is not enjoying subsidy. So, what subsidy are they paying on petrol, which is for domestic use and not industrial use? Industries even have to use diesel steadily due to poor electric power supply. We need to get our priority right.\u201d\n\nThe IMF had in its 2021 Article IV, which was released in February, said the federal government could spend as much as 92.6 per cent of its revenue on debt servicing this year.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "summary": "The experts are kicking against the federal governments proclivity for debt, which they have described as unsustainable, calling for increased productivity with a view to boosting revenue.\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s current debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 22.47 per cent is relatively low, giving it room to borrow, its inability to generate adequate revenue has worsened its debt problem.\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is on the brink of debt distress because our debt profile now is not sustainable.\nWe had a debt service to revenue ratio getting to 76 per cent as of November last year.\nHe said, \u201cWe are already in debt distress if we are spending a large proportion of our revenue on debt servicing, we are in trouble and our revenue is not growing.",

          "title": "Buhari Absolves Adamu, Says Ex-PDP Members In APC Have Repented",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday descended verbally on those casting aspersions on the All Progressives Congress (APC) for allowing former members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) take control of the leadership of the governing party, saying the former opposition members have all repented.\n\nIn a tacit response to media reports in this regard, the president wondered whether it was no more Scriptural for sinners who repent and change their ways to be forgiven.\n\nOur sister publication, LEADERSHIP Sunday, had exclusively reported yesterday that uneasy calm had pervaded the APC, as a vast majority of former members of the opposition PDP have taken charge of the leadership of the governing party as members of the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAccording to the paper, the implications of this invasion of the APC leadership by former opposition members may not be obvious just yet, but as the party heads towards party primaries for the 2023 general elections, it could become clearer that all the president\u2019s men have lost out in the future of the party and probably future governments in the states and the federal level.\n\nBut President Buhari who returned to Eagle Square, venue of Saturday\u2019s national convention, in Abuja yesterday morning, along with the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Senate President Ahmed Lawan for the inauguration of the new NWC members of the APC accused members of the opposition who he said had taken to the newspapers and the airwaves to find alternative ways to shore up their reputations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, quoted the president as saying: \u201cWhat the (APC) Convention made clear was how the media has been peddling fake news of division, when the hard reality of unity, cohesion, and indeed personal warmth between members of the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 was evident for all to see.\n\n\u201cOf course, the blame for this mindset ought rightly to go to the opposition who in all these years had done the work to only divide the country, leading to all manner of separatist agitations. But this is not the wish, nor is it in the character of the citizens, as was clear for everyone to see at the Eagle Square.\n\n\u201cWhen their fake news of disunity was undone by the facts, some in the opposition could not help themselves but took to the newspapers and the airwaves to find another way to shore up their reputations. That some of the APC\u2019s new leadership were once in the opposition was the new line to take to the media, somehow suggesting that those who have left one party should not hold positions in another.\n\nYet, do the Scriptures not teach us of the virtue of sinners who repent and change their ways? What the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways. Given that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute. It is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari however noted that the electorate in Nigeria can see through \u201csuch acrobatics and know the facts that when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d\n\nThe president formally congratulated the Abdullahi Adamu-led 79-member NWC of the APC that emerged at Saturday\u2019s convention in Abuja, saying the unity of members put on display puts the party on a firmer footing for victory in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the smooth conduct of the election raises the prospect of a mouth-watering APC victory next year.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe APC Convention hosted this weekend sets the scene for an APC victory in the presidential and general elections next year. It is a victory over naysayers who believed the party was divided but are now disappointed,\u201d said the President.\n\nWe believe that it is equally a victory for the president who has ensured unity across all party positions; and it is a victory for the voters of Nigeria who can now be assured of a smooth succession to new leadership in 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\nNo, Former Nasarawa Governor Still Facing Trial Over N15bn Fraud \u2013 PDP\n\nBut hitting back at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) disagreed with President Buhari that has its former members in APC leadership have repented, just as it reminded the APC some of its new NWC members still have corruption cases in court.\n\nSpecifically, the main opposition party in the country lampooned the APC over what it described as \u201cimposition\u201d of Sen Abdullahi Adamu as its national chairman despite his arraignment in court on a 149-count charge of alleged fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\nThe PDP also described APC convention as a jamboree of lies, celebration of illegality, corruption and arrogance in failure, adding that any leadership birthed through such process can only be overtly corrupt, debauched and illegal.\n\nIn a statement issued by its national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the PDP said, \u201cIt is clear that with the combination of the corrupt, deceitful and rudderless Buhari-led APC government and the illegitimate Abdullahi Adamu-led party leadership, corruption, economic hardship and rudderlessness in the APC government will worsen in our country in the remaining one year of the APC in government.\n\n\u201cThe composition of the APC national leadership is a clear confirmation that President Buhari has never been committed to the fight against corruption as well as his willingness to further open our national vaults to ravenous treasury looters in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe PDP challenges members of the illegitimate APC national leadership, particularly Sen. Adamu to come clean on corruption charges against them.\n\n\u201cThe new APC Chairman should inform Nigerians why he was not courageous enough to submit himself to trial at the Federal High Court, Lafia, Nasarawa State rather than hide under technicalities. Senator Adamu should therefore come clean to Nigerians on the said case before parading himself as a saint.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore pathetic to see Sen. Adamu showboating on stage to impress his puppet master by attempting to denigrate other Nigerians and our great Party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur Party has only pity for Sen. Adamu and does not intend to confer him an undue relevance with a response. Sen. Adamu should however be conscious of the fact that time does not run against the State in criminal matters. He should therefore not have any illusion that being an APC Chairman will avail him a perpetual cover.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it was appalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievement were being made.\u201d\n\nPDP further said it was shameful that while APC leaders were \u201clying on stage in Abuja\u201d, terrorists were busy attacking the Kaduna International Airport, located in an APC controlled state.\n\nThe opposition party further cautioned aspirants intending to participate in the 2023 general elections under the APC to note that they are on a journey to nowhere with the APC.\n\nI Will Be Fair To All As National Chairman \u2013 Adamu\n\nMeanwhile, the new national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has promised to be fair in piloting the affairs of the party.\n\nHe implored members of the governing party to rekindle their faith in the party\u2019s leadership at all levels to allow for a new dawn in the party.\n\nAdamu vowed to activate processes leading to the healing of wounds and reconciliation of all aggrieved persons to unify the APC into a formidable force ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nSpeaking at Eagles Square, venue of the APC national convention, the former Nasarawa State governor told all party members, including fellow aspirants, that all hands must be on deck in steering the ship of state \u201cthrough the inclement weather of our divisive national politics to the promised land\u201d.\n\nThe newly elected APC chairman stated: \u201cWe need to renew our faith in our party and its leadership at all levels in order to herald a new dawn. We need to commit to the resolution of our crisis within the confines of our party constitution.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to blow every minor personal disagreement into a major party crisis. It is time for us to do things differently. When we quarrel, we open our flanks to our rival political parties that are only too eager to exploit them for their own benefit.\n\n\u201cI promise you here and now that we shall heal any wounds in our party; we shall effect lasting reconciliation among our members, and we shall go into the next general elections as a strong and united party.\n\n\u201d I offer my hands of friendship to all our members. I want to assure you that my colleagues and myself will run an open door policy to all members of the party\u201d.\n\nAdamu further applauded the Buhari-led APC administration for surpassing all previous administrations in addressing massive Infrastructural deficit, even as he assured that with the love and support of all Nigerians, the party will do more in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cNo Administration in the history of Nigeria has performed as much as we did in building key infrastructure and in uplifting the living conditions of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cProjects that once existed only in the dreams of Nigerians such as the Second Niger Bridge, complete rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ibadan dual carriageway, the Lagos-Ibadan express rail, the Abuja-Kaduna express light rail, the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano pipeline and many others, have either been started and completed during our Administration or have been inherited in abandoned conditions and have made rapid progress in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cNo government can satisfy everybody, however hard it works. Some work will always be left undone and every work done will continue to need maintenance, expansion and improvement. We are however satisfied that APC has fulfilled its covenant with the Nigerian people,\u201d he stated.\n\nAdamu warned that APC cannot afford to mistep if it will continue to enjoy the trust pointing out the way forward is to enhance the party\u2019s Internal Democracy.\n\nHe further urged journalists to emulate the patriotic fervour of forerunners like Nnamdi Azikiwe,Obafemi Awolowo, Malam Abubakar Imam, Alhaji Alade Odunewu and other media pioneers, saying \u201cthose great pioneers of Nigerian journalism always put the interests of Nigeria and its people above all other considerations and they always worked for the peace, progress and prosperity of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nAdamu Suitable For APC \u2013 Lawan\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, has said Senator Abdullahi Adamu is the suitable person to lead the APC.\n\nAccording to him, Adamu\u2019s victory at the just concluded national convention of the party is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media office last night, Lawan said, \u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on his emergence as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the just concluded National Convention of our great party.\n\n\u201cThe unanimous affirmation of Senator Adamu\u2019s candidature at the convention is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\n\u201cI share this common belief in his suitability for piloting the affairs of our great party from this very important juncture.\n\n\u201cSenator Adamu\u2019s antecedents as a political leader and astute administrator show that our party has made a great choice in his election as our National Chairman.\u201d\n\nLawan Also said the people of Yobe State were extremely proud of Governor Mai Mala Buni for his achievements while he was chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nIn a congratulatory message on his success as CECPC chairman, Lawan, an indigene of Yobe State, said people of the state are proud of Governor Buni\u2019s performance while he held sway as the head of CECPC.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, Governor of Yobe State, my brother, on the successful completion of his crucial assignment as the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary , Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Buni was called to the assignment in June 2020, the APC was by all appearances in dire straits.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC was principally tasked with resolving disputes that were pushing the party to the edge of the precipice in many states and at the national level, and with organizing congresses and the National Convention that would produce new leaders for the party at all levels,\u201d he stated.\n\nGovernor Inuwa Congratulates Adamu, Other NWC Members\n\nAlso, Gombe State governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya yesterday congratulated former Sen Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as national chairman of the APC at the national convention of the party.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his director-general of Press Affairs, Ismaila Uba Misilli, also felicitated with other national and zonal officers of the APC who were elected at the convention.\n\nGovernor Inuwa particularly praised the leadership direction and guidance of President Buhari, which he said facilitated the consensus arrangement that produced the new crop of leaders of the APC and further consolidated the unity of the APC.\n\n\u201cThe maturity displayed at the convention has demonstrated the spirit of unity of purpose and strong will of our members as well as indivisiblity of the force of our great party.\n\n\u201cSpecial appreciation must go to our leader and amiable President, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for providing leadership and guidance that saw to the successful and rancour- free conduct of the convention\u201d.\n\nThe Governor also eulogised the caretaker/extraordinary national convention planning committee headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State for successfully superintending over the affairs of the APC within the period of its stewardship and for strengthening unity, understanding and camaraderie among party faithful\u201d.\n\nWhile expressing confidence in the ability of the new NWC under the leadership of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu to strear the party to greatness, Governor Yahyaha charged the new leaders to bring to bear their respective wealth of experiences to consolidate on the gains recorded so far and chart a new cause that will further boost the fortunes of the party and guarantee its victory in future elections.\n\nAl-Makura, Mustapha Pledge Support For Adamu-led NWC\n\nSimilarly, former national chairmanship aspirants on the platform of the APC, Senator Tanko Al-Makura and former deputy national chairman of defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha, have pledged support for Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led national leadership of the party.\n\nWhile Al-Makura visited Adamu at his residence in Abuja, Mustapha issued a solidarity statement.\n\nSpeaking after he met with Adamu, Al-Makura said, \u201cOn behalf of my Campaign Organisation, I conveyed warm congratulations to him and the entire newly elected leadership of the APC on their emergence in the just concluded convention.\u201d\n\nHe said the party has displayed first-rate problem-solving, dispute resolution, and organisational aptitude through a rancor-free and smooth national convention, adding that APC has, once again, disappointed the naysayers and its enemies to shame.\n\n\u201cWith the national convention done and dusted, I have no doubt that our great party is now well repositioned and good to go into the 2023 elections with confidence, as I have no doubt that the new leadership has all it takes to navigate our party to victory in 2023 and beyond.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is God that gives power. Therefore, I not only throw my support behind the new party leadership, but also urge every party leader and faithful to do the same.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mustapha, through his campaign organisation extended its good wishes to the newly inaugurated Adamu-led APC NWC.\n\nIn a statement issued by its director general, Mallam Bala Usman, the organisation wished the new national executives all the best in their quest to strengthen the ruling party ahead of the task ahead.\n\n\u201cNow that the national convention has been concluded and new party executives are in place, our focus is now on the task of putting up a unified and formidable structure ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this has to be the first step to ensuring that our party counters the threat posed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and continues our winning streak at the centre which began in 2015.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari Absolves Adamu, Says Ex-PDP Members In APC Have Repented",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday descended verbally on those casting aspersions on the All Progressives Congress (APC) for allowing former members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) take control of the leadership of the governing party, saying the former opposition members have all repented.\n\nIn a tacit response to media reports in this regard, the president wondered whether it was no more Scriptural for sinners who repent and change their ways to be forgiven.\n\nOur sister publication, LEADERSHIP Sunday, had exclusively reported yesterday that uneasy calm had pervaded the APC, as a vast majority of former members of the opposition PDP have taken charge of the leadership of the governing party as members of the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAccording to the paper, the implications of this invasion of the APC leadership by former opposition members may not be obvious just yet, but as the party heads towards party primaries for the 2023 general elections, it could become clearer that all the president\u2019s men have lost out in the future of the party and probably future governments in the states and the federal level.\n\nBut President Buhari who returned to Eagle Square, venue of Saturday\u2019s national convention, in Abuja yesterday morning, along with the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Senate President Ahmed Lawan for the inauguration of the new NWC members of the APC accused members of the opposition who he said had taken to the newspapers and the airwaves to find alternative ways to shore up their reputations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, quoted the president as saying: \u201cWhat the (APC) Convention made clear was how the media has been peddling fake news of division, when the hard reality of unity, cohesion, and indeed personal warmth between members of the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 was evident for all to see.\n\n\u201cOf course, the blame for this mindset ought rightly to go to the opposition who in all these years had done the work to only divide the country, leading to all manner of separatist agitations. But this is not the wish, nor is it in the character of the citizens, as was clear for everyone to see at the Eagle Square.\n\n\u201cWhen their fake news of disunity was undone by the facts, some in the opposition could not help themselves but took to the newspapers and the airwaves to find another way to shore up their reputations. That some of the APC\u2019s new leadership were once in the opposition was the new line to take to the media, somehow suggesting that those who have left one party should not hold positions in another.\n\nYet, do the Scriptures not teach us of the virtue of sinners who repent and change their ways? What the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways. Given that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute. It is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari however noted that the electorate in Nigeria can see through \u201csuch acrobatics and know the facts that when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d\n\nThe president formally congratulated the Abdullahi Adamu-led 79-member NWC of the APC that emerged at Saturday\u2019s convention in Abuja, saying the unity of members put on display puts the party on a firmer footing for victory in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the smooth conduct of the election raises the prospect of a mouth-watering APC victory next year.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe APC Convention hosted this weekend sets the scene for an APC victory in the presidential and general elections next year. It is a victory over naysayers who believed the party was divided but are now disappointed,\u201d said the President.\n\nWe believe that it is equally a victory for the president who has ensured unity across all party positions; and it is a victory for the voters of Nigeria who can now be assured of a smooth succession to new leadership in 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\nNo, Former Nasarawa Governor Still Facing Trial Over N15bn Fraud \u2013 PDP\n\nBut hitting back at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) disagreed with President Buhari that has its former members in APC leadership have repented, just as it reminded the APC some of its new NWC members still have corruption cases in court.\n\nSpecifically, the main opposition party in the country lampooned the APC over what it described as \u201cimposition\u201d of Sen Abdullahi Adamu as its national chairman despite his arraignment in court on a 149-count charge of alleged fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\nThe PDP also described APC convention as a jamboree of lies, celebration of illegality, corruption and arrogance in failure, adding that any leadership birthed through such process can only be overtly corrupt, debauched and illegal.\n\nIn a statement issued by its national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the PDP said, \u201cIt is clear that with the combination of the corrupt, deceitful and rudderless Buhari-led APC government and the illegitimate Abdullahi Adamu-led party leadership, corruption, economic hardship and rudderlessness in the APC government will worsen in our country in the remaining one year of the APC in government.\n\n\u201cThe composition of the APC national leadership is a clear confirmation that President Buhari has never been committed to the fight against corruption as well as his willingness to further open our national vaults to ravenous treasury looters in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe PDP challenges members of the illegitimate APC national leadership, particularly Sen. Adamu to come clean on corruption charges against them.\n\n\u201cThe new APC Chairman should inform Nigerians why he was not courageous enough to submit himself to trial at the Federal High Court, Lafia, Nasarawa State rather than hide under technicalities. Senator Adamu should therefore come clean to Nigerians on the said case before parading himself as a saint.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore pathetic to see Sen. Adamu showboating on stage to impress his puppet master by attempting to denigrate other Nigerians and our great Party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur Party has only pity for Sen. Adamu and does not intend to confer him an undue relevance with a response. Sen. Adamu should however be conscious of the fact that time does not run against the State in criminal matters. He should therefore not have any illusion that being an APC Chairman will avail him a perpetual cover.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it was appalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievement were being made.\u201d\n\nPDP further said it was shameful that while APC leaders were \u201clying on stage in Abuja\u201d, terrorists were busy attacking the Kaduna International Airport, located in an APC controlled state.\n\nThe opposition party further cautioned aspirants intending to participate in the 2023 general elections under the APC to note that they are on a journey to nowhere with the APC.\n\nI Will Be Fair To All As National Chairman \u2013 Adamu\n\nMeanwhile, the new national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has promised to be fair in piloting the affairs of the party.\n\nHe implored members of the governing party to rekindle their faith in the party\u2019s leadership at all levels to allow for a new dawn in the party.\n\nAdamu vowed to activate processes leading to the healing of wounds and reconciliation of all aggrieved persons to unify the APC into a formidable force ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nSpeaking at Eagles Square, venue of the APC national convention, the former Nasarawa State governor told all party members, including fellow aspirants, that all hands must be on deck in steering the ship of state \u201cthrough the inclement weather of our divisive national politics to the promised land\u201d.\n\nThe newly elected APC chairman stated: \u201cWe need to renew our faith in our party and its leadership at all levels in order to herald a new dawn. We need to commit to the resolution of our crisis within the confines of our party constitution.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to blow every minor personal disagreement into a major party crisis. It is time for us to do things differently. When we quarrel, we open our flanks to our rival political parties that are only too eager to exploit them for their own benefit.\n\n\u201cI promise you here and now that we shall heal any wounds in our party; we shall effect lasting reconciliation among our members, and we shall go into the next general elections as a strong and united party.\n\n\u201d I offer my hands of friendship to all our members. I want to assure you that my colleagues and myself will run an open door policy to all members of the party\u201d.\n\nAdamu further applauded the Buhari-led APC administration for surpassing all previous administrations in addressing massive Infrastructural deficit, even as he assured that with the love and support of all Nigerians, the party will do more in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cNo Administration in the history of Nigeria has performed as much as we did in building key infrastructure and in uplifting the living conditions of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cProjects that once existed only in the dreams of Nigerians such as the Second Niger Bridge, complete rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ibadan dual carriageway, the Lagos-Ibadan express rail, the Abuja-Kaduna express light rail, the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano pipeline and many others, have either been started and completed during our Administration or have been inherited in abandoned conditions and have made rapid progress in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cNo government can satisfy everybody, however hard it works. Some work will always be left undone and every work done will continue to need maintenance, expansion and improvement. We are however satisfied that APC has fulfilled its covenant with the Nigerian people,\u201d he stated.\n\nAdamu warned that APC cannot afford to mistep if it will continue to enjoy the trust pointing out the way forward is to enhance the party\u2019s Internal Democracy.\n\nHe further urged journalists to emulate the patriotic fervour of forerunners like Nnamdi Azikiwe,Obafemi Awolowo, Malam Abubakar Imam, Alhaji Alade Odunewu and other media pioneers, saying \u201cthose great pioneers of Nigerian journalism always put the interests of Nigeria and its people above all other considerations and they always worked for the peace, progress and prosperity of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nAdamu Suitable For APC \u2013 Lawan\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, has said Senator Abdullahi Adamu is the suitable person to lead the APC.\n\nAccording to him, Adamu\u2019s victory at the just concluded national convention of the party is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media office last night, Lawan said, \u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on his emergence as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the just concluded National Convention of our great party.\n\n\u201cThe unanimous affirmation of Senator Adamu\u2019s candidature at the convention is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\n\u201cI share this common belief in his suitability for piloting the affairs of our great party from this very important juncture.\n\n\u201cSenator Adamu\u2019s antecedents as a political leader and astute administrator show that our party has made a great choice in his election as our National Chairman.\u201d\n\nLawan Also said the people of Yobe State were extremely proud of Governor Mai Mala Buni for his achievements while he was chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nIn a congratulatory message on his success as CECPC chairman, Lawan, an indigene of Yobe State, said people of the state are proud of Governor Buni\u2019s performance while he held sway as the head of CECPC.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, Governor of Yobe State, my brother, on the successful completion of his crucial assignment as the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary , Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Buni was called to the assignment in June 2020, the APC was by all appearances in dire straits.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC was principally tasked with resolving disputes that were pushing the party to the edge of the precipice in many states and at the national level, and with organizing congresses and the National Convention that would produce new leaders for the party at all levels,\u201d he stated.\n\nGovernor Inuwa Congratulates Adamu, Other NWC Members\n\nAlso, Gombe State governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya yesterday congratulated former Sen Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as national chairman of the APC at the national convention of the party.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his director-general of Press Affairs, Ismaila Uba Misilli, also felicitated with other national and zonal officers of the APC who were elected at the convention.\n\nGovernor Inuwa particularly praised the leadership direction and guidance of President Buhari, which he said facilitated the consensus arrangement that produced the new crop of leaders of the APC and further consolidated the unity of the APC.\n\n\u201cThe maturity displayed at the convention has demonstrated the spirit of unity of purpose and strong will of our members as well as indivisiblity of the force of our great party.\n\n\u201cSpecial appreciation must go to our leader and amiable President, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for providing leadership and guidance that saw to the successful and rancour- free conduct of the convention\u201d.\n\nThe Governor also eulogised the caretaker/extraordinary national convention planning committee headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State for successfully superintending over the affairs of the APC within the period of its stewardship and for strengthening unity, understanding and camaraderie among party faithful\u201d.\n\nWhile expressing confidence in the ability of the new NWC under the leadership of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu to strear the party to greatness, Governor Yahyaha charged the new leaders to bring to bear their respective wealth of experiences to consolidate on the gains recorded so far and chart a new cause that will further boost the fortunes of the party and guarantee its victory in future elections.\n\nAl-Makura, Mustapha Pledge Support For Adamu-led NWC\n\nSimilarly, former national chairmanship aspirants on the platform of the APC, Senator Tanko Al-Makura and former deputy national chairman of defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha, have pledged support for Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led national leadership of the party.\n\nWhile Al-Makura visited Adamu at his residence in Abuja, Mustapha issued a solidarity statement.\n\nSpeaking after he met with Adamu, Al-Makura said, \u201cOn behalf of my Campaign Organisation, I conveyed warm congratulations to him and the entire newly elected leadership of the APC on their emergence in the just concluded convention.\u201d\n\nHe said the party has displayed first-rate problem-solving, dispute resolution, and organisational aptitude through a rancor-free and smooth national convention, adding that APC has, once again, disappointed the naysayers and its enemies to shame.\n\n\u201cWith the national convention done and dusted, I have no doubt that our great party is now well repositioned and good to go into the 2023 elections with confidence, as I have no doubt that the new leadership has all it takes to navigate our party to victory in 2023 and beyond.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is God that gives power. Therefore, I not only throw my support behind the new party leadership, but also urge every party leader and faithful to do the same.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mustapha, through his campaign organisation extended its good wishes to the newly inaugurated Adamu-led APC NWC.\n\nIn a statement issued by its director general, Mallam Bala Usman, the organisation wished the new national executives all the best in their quest to strengthen the ruling party ahead of the task ahead.\n\n\u201cNow that the national convention has been concluded and new party executives are in place, our focus is now on the task of putting up a unified and formidable structure ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this has to be the first step to ensuring that our party counters the threat posed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and continues our winning streak at the centre which began in 2015.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe days of hunger in the land are numbered as Nigerians will soon begin to feel the impact of the Federal Government\u2019s effort to revamp the agricultural sector, even on their dining tables.\n\nMr Lai Mohammed, who is the Minister of Information and Culture, gave the assurance on Monday while briefing reporters in Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn fact, no government has invested in an agricultural revolution like the Buhari administration,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey (critics) say \u2018oh, but Nigerians are still hungry, and the price of the staples is still high\u2019. Our response is that the impact of our agriculture revolution will soon be felt on dining tables across the country.\u201d\n\nThe minister urged farmers to support the government\u2019s drive in ensuring food sufficiency by shunning unnecessary export of farm produce in illegal manners.\n\nHe informed Nigerians that the government was not unmindful of the challenges in the various sectors of the country, including the economy, security, and power, among others.\n\nNew Nigeria\n\nMohammed, however, assured them that the government has risen stoutly to these problems by judiciously utilising the scarce resources at its disposal to make an impact.\n\n\u201cNigerians are making great sacrifices because they know that today\u2019s difficulties are like the pangs heralding the birth of a new baby,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s pains won\u2019t endure, but the new Nigeria that will emerge will surely do!\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to our farmers to be more patriotic by not allowing foreigners to buy their commodities at farm gates. They should reciprocate the support being given to them by the Federal Government by slowing down on exports in order to increase the supply of local staples and also reduce prices.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018A New Nigeria Will Surely Emerge\u2019: Full Text Of Lai Mohammed\u2019s Briefing\n\nThe minister accused the opposition of frittering away the nation\u2019s resources to import rice and other staples. He, however, said the present administration has worked progressively to ensure food security as a nation.\n\nRice production in Nigeria, according to him, has increased to over 7.5 million metric tons annually, thanks to the Anchor Borrowers Programme of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nNigerian Problem\n\nMohammed explained that before the programme, the average production in Nigeria between 1999 to 2015 was less than four million metric tons annually, and there were 15 standard rice mills before the programme was launched as against the 50 mills now spread across the country.\n\nHe added that more than 4.8 million smallholder farmers have so far been supported, with a resultant increase in the production of 23 agricultural commodities including maize, rice, oil palm, cocoa, cotton, cassava, tomato and livestock.\n\nThe minister also spoke about the increase in the prices of food items and fuel experienced in Nigeria, stressing that the situation was the same even in some developed countries.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe figures being bandied around by the folks on the other side and a section of the press, comparing the prices of some foodstuffs, petrol, diesel, etc pre-2015 and now; this misuse of statistics is clear mischief. Those who bandy around these figures without putting them in context are being clever by half.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take the price of foodstuffs and petrol. Google the price of foodstuffs in other countries, especially the UK and the US, and you will discover a steep rise. Ditto for the price of gas or petrol. What we are saying is that this increase is a global trend, and it\u2019s not limited to any country.\n\n\u201cTherefore, presenting it as a Nigerian problem is mischievous, disingenuous and a clear act of misinformation. Let me add that the crippling fuel shortage experienced across the country in recent times has started easing, as the measures put in place by the government begin to work.\u201d",

The option of consensus in selecting the majority of the party leaders was clearly in line with legal standing although positions where there was no agreed consensus, contestants went through the polls,\u201d the Kogi Governor said.\n\nHe assured that in the forthcoming primaries, the party would go through a democratic process that would be accepted generally by all stakeholders, adding that he was not afraid of any mode chosen by the party.\n\nGovernor Bello, while fielding questions on women\u2019s inclusion in governance, revealed that he would not require legislative backing to include women in government, stressing that Kogi State, under his leadership, had performed tremendously well.\n\n\u201cThis is why women across the nation have been calling on me to run for president, considering the robust track record of giving women high-level inclusion in my administration,\u201d he noted.",
