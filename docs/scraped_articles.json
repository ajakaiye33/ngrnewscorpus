          "title": "Why proposed census is a misplaced priority \u2013 Yoruba group",
          "text": "A group, the Yoruba Global Alliance, has faulted the proposed population census across the country by the Federal Government despite the prevailing security challenges in Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Government had on Thursday in Abuja revealed plans to hold the national population census in April 2023. This is the first time such exercise will be holding in 17 years.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the government had planned to conduct the exercise in 2021 but it was later put off largely due to insecurity in parts of the country. The last time Nigeria conducted the exercise was in 2006. That exercise put the country\u2019s population at 140.43 million \u2013 71.3 million males and 69.0 million females.\n\nBut, briefing State House correspondents at the end of a meeting of the Council of State presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, the Director-General of Nigeria Population Commission, Nasir Isa-Kwarra, disclosed the plan to conduct census in 2023.\n\nWhile noting that the NPC would hold a pilot census in June (this year) after the political primaries, Isa-Kwarra said the commission would deploy high-grade technology during the exercise.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Sunday titled, \u2018Census, which census?\u2019 and signed by its President and Chairman of Council, Dr. Amos Akingba and Chief Tola Adeniyi respectively, the Yoruba group argued that considering its timing, the proposed census remained a misplaced priority.\n\nThe group described the proposed headcount as \u201cinvidious and obviously self-serving political miscalculation and mis-adventure\u201d.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is inconceivable that any serious-minded government should ever consider human population enumeration amidst an atmosphere of unprecedented insecurity, mistrust, unbridled corruption, and pervasive economic woes. It would be like a similar exercise conducted in 1974 which the subsequent Murtala Muhammed Military junta immediately jettisoned on assumption of office in 1975.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth could be the rationale for seeking to do a national headcount at this point in time, especially amidst rumours and permutations that the Unitary government in Abuja may have other tricks up its sleeves regarding holding national elections slated for March next year?\n\n\u201cHuman population census requires meticulous planning, including but not limited to cartographic capturing, enumeration of houses and other dwelling places, comprehensive physical counting of human heads all over the country and, of course, a huge man-power outlay.\n\n\u201cIn a situation where guardians and parents have stopped allowing their children and wards to proceed to mandatory Youths Service Corps outside their immediate environment, and hundreds of thousands have fled their homesteads because of pampered marauding human butchers, euphemistically tagged bandits, where will the government import enumerators from?\n\n\u201cWe should admit the obvious fact that Nigeria is at war with itself. Census exercises are never conducted in a war situation.\n\n\u201cMore than 4 million Nigerians are scattered in Internally Displaced Persons camps all over the country most especially in the far Northern states of the country and Niger state. Who is going to count people who have been sentenced to humongous suffering by their own people in a country where suspicious terrorism holds sway?\n\n\u201cThere can only be one reason for this unreasonable scheming: come up with terribly skewed census figures and plunge the uneasy country to further confusion, infighting, insurrection and catastrophic implosion and ultimately full-blown Civil War.\n\n\u201cWe call on well-meaning Nigerians most especially respectable elders who knew Nigeria when it enjoyed a good measure of civilization and civility, to urge President Muhammadu Buhari to halt this unwarranted assault.\n\n\u201cWe equally urge the National Assembly to deploy whatever balls they have to stop this open invitation to anarchy.\n\n\u201cStudent Organizations, Nigeria Bar Association, the entire Media Outlets, Labour and Trade Organizations and all the Civil Society Platforms must rise up in unison to out-rightly condemn and reject this odious and obnoxious fraudulent scheming.\n\n\u201cFinally, we warn those who are the puppeteers, the faceless advisers and mis-advisers to keep off, and stop leading the government to a certain ruinous end.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, John Tsoho has reversed himself in an earlier rejection of a request by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi for the transfer of a pending case against him to a new judge for hearing during the Easter vacation.\n\nJustice Tsoho had in a letter dated April 7, 2022, written by his Special Assistant (SA), Ambrose Unaeze rejected Amaechi\u2019s request for a suit transfer which he made through his lawyer, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) on March 31, 2022\n\nBut in a fresh letter dated April 14, 2022, Justice Tsoho overruled himself and agreed to transfer part of the case marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1587/2021 to a new Judge.\n\nThe suit is challenging Amaechi\u2019s handling of the process for the award of the contract for operators of Nigeria\u2019s International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) to a new judge.\n\nA civil group, the Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER) instituted the suit against Amaechi, accusing him of manipulating the contract process in favour of two local and inexperienced firms \u2013 Medtech Scientific Limited and Rozi International Nigeria Limited.\n\nOn December 17, 2021, following an ex parte application by CASER, the court restrained parties from taking any further steps in relation to the appointment of operators of the ICTN (an electronic cargo verification system that monitors the shipments of seaborne cargoes and enables a real-time generation of vital data on ships and cargo traffic in and out of Nigeria).\n\nBut on March 23, 2022, CASER\u2019s lawyer, Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN) reported to the court presided by Justice Donatus Okorowo that Amaechi had allegedly violated the court\u2019s order of December 17, prompting the judge to endorse the filing of contempt charges against the minister.\n\nJustice Okorowo also directed the suspension of proceedings in the substantive suit to give way to the hearing of contempt charges against Amaechi and fixed May 9 for ruling in a joinder application and commencement of contempt proceedings.\n\nRather than wait till May 9, Amaechi, through his lawyer, wrote the March 31 letter, claiming utmost urgency, among others and requested that the case against him be reassigned to the court\u2019s vacation judge for urgent hearing.\n\nResponding, Justice Tsoho in the April 7 letter, declined the request, stating, \u201cI am to inform you that there have been counter posturing regarding the re-assignment or otherwise of this matter.\n\n\u201cIt is discerned that arguments were heard by Justice D.U Okorowo on 23rd March 2022 in respect of alleged contempt and ruling scheduled for 9th May 2022. It will hence be disruptive to contemplate a re-assignment of this case.\n\n\u201cBesides, the Easter vacation is for two weeks and there is no guarantee that the vacation Judge can gain any appreciable ground as to convey an advantage over the regular Court in terms of hearing of the suit. In the circumstance, the Hon. Chief Judge declined the application.\u201d\n\nBut following another letter by Ameachi\u2019s lawyer, dated April 13, 2022, Justice Tsoho changed his mind and agreed that a portion of the suit be reassigned to the court\u2019s vacation judge.\n\nJustice Tsoho\u2019s fresh letter, dated: April 14, written by his SA (Unaeze) in response to Amaechi\u2019s new letter, reads: \u201cI am directed by the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to refer to your letter of 13th April 2022 in respect of the above subject matter.\n\n\u201cHaving considered the responses as per your letters dated 13th April 2022, 1st April 2022 respectively, it is noted as follows: that there is presently no indication of any proper or formal application for contempt proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe filing of Form 48 per se does not amount to a contempt application or committal proceedings, in the absence of Form 49 with evidence of the alleged contemnor\u2019s disobedience obtained after service of Form 48.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in view of the extreme urgency emphasised with regard to the matter, there is a good basis for referring the pending applications to be heard during the Easter vacation.\n\n\u201cConsequently, our letter dated 7 April 2022 is cancelled. The pending notice of preliminary objection and the application for joinder in the suit (but not the suit itself) are reassigned to the vacation court for determination. Please accept the assurances of His Lordship, the Hon. Chief Judge.\u201d\n\nCASER, the plaintiff in the suit has expressed reservation about Justice Tsoho\u2019s latest decision to have the case partially transferred to a new judge.\n\nIn a statement by its Executive Director, Frank Tietie, CASER argued that it was impossible for Justice Tsoho\u2019s decision to ensure justice in the case.\n\nIt said: \u201cThus, the directive that only the preliminary objection be heard by a vacation court leaving the main suit is aimed, in our opinion, at terminating the suit without the court adjudicating on the real issues of corruption and incompetence of the companies, as it should be.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the latest directive of the Chief Judge to transfer the suit as impressed on him by counsel to the Honourable Minister of Transportation, when there is no real urgency, is but just a self-serving one that is not in any way in the interest of Nigeria\u2019s national security, thereby endangering the peace and welfare of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the course of the administration of justice should run smoothly without any undue pressure.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we are very uncomfortable with the latest directive of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court that a suit that is due to be heard in less than one month be transferred to a vacation judge for reasons which he had earlier considered to be highly untenable.\u201d",
          "summary": "Chief Judge declined the application.\u201dBut following another letter by Ameachi\u2019s lawyer, dated April 13, 2022, Justice Tsoho changed his mind and agreed that a portion of the suit be reassigned to the court\u2019s vacation judge.\nJustice Tsoho\u2019s fresh letter, dated: April 14, written by his SA (Unaeze) in response to Amaechi\u2019s new letter, reads: \u201cI am directed by the Hon.\nChief Judge of the Federal High Court to refer to your letter of 13th April 2022 in respect of the above subject matter.\n\u201cConsequently, our letter dated 7 April 2022 is cancelled.\nThe pending notice of preliminary objection and the application for joinder in the suit (but not the suit itself) are reassigned to the vacation court for determination.",

          "title": "Pat Utomi exclusive: Why Nigerians should reject APC, PDP in 2023",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nPat Utomi is Professor of Political Economy and teacher at the Lagos Business School.\n\nHe is the founder, Centre for Value in Leadership (CVL), as well as former presidential adviser, ex-presidential candidate, and co-convener of the National Consultative Forum of Leaders of Conscience.\n\nIn this no-holds-barred interview with Sunday Sun, he raised the alarm on the need for Nigerians to look for an alternative government in the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have failed in the rescue mission.\n\nHe spoke on other critical national issues, including zoning, failure of leadership, and pointed the way forward. Excerpt:\n\nContrary to the expectation that the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will zone its presidency to the South, the party has decided to throw it open to all zones. What is the implication?\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nI don\u2019t think that they have announced any conclusion as such; I think we are all still speculating or have they formally said anything?\n\nThe signs are there from their body language that it can go anywhere\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) This is really the fundamental problem with Nigerian politics, it has never been generally governed by principles, it is often been a function of the convenience of those who have money, that is precisely why Nigeria is lying prostrate right now. Nigeria suffers from a collapse of culture, character means nothing, and your word means nothing. In fact, in the Nigerian language when your behaviour is ugly and unredeemable, all you have to do to give it a semblance of decency or whatever is to say, \u2018haba, na politics naa\u2019. I am just being political, that means, if it is politics, it does not have to be decent, and because of this cold-blooded slaughter of decency in the name of politics, Nigeria does not manage to do things that are trustworthy and so the world stopped trusting Nigeria. And this affects Nigeria in business, it affects Nigeria in terms of its reputation generally and how Nigerians are treated around the world. So, when we say that values shape human progress, there is no argument about that. There is low-value content in Nigerian character and how people make and break promises. I am giving you a general analysis of human nature and to come to the specifics of the PDP, nobody forced PDP to put that (zoning) in their constitution and they have not reviewed their constitution but they have reviewed the act because some people, somehow, think that it is not convenient for them, but you see we have principles. We play politics with everything; the two past presidents are both from Katsina and so it\u2019s North, it was okay, but they say okay it should be coming to South and then the people from the Southeast say it\u2019s Southeast, it\u2019s Southeast, then any Igboman who is from Rivers is not involved because they are just bad candidates, they know that they cannot compete so they begin to narrow it so that it can reach them without their having the competence. So, how will you have the moral courage to speak up when you are being driven without principle? And the people who are making this noise don\u2019t know how much closer we all are. In December or November of 1983, when the F28 plane crash in Enugu took place, President Shehu Shagari when he came back went to Enugu for a condolence visit with the vice president and the delegation and when his visit was over and President Shagari flew back to Lagos, Dr Alex Ekwueme, the VP, flew in the same plane (Ministry of Transport Jet) with Umaru Dikko and myself and a couple of other people into Ibadan, the NPN convention was taking place in Ibadan. When we got to the stadium in Ibadan, Ekwueme, the great man, brought out his symbol of office and asked me to hold it. That singular act was a symbolism of something. Let me not go further with this story, it is a story for another day. We just went in briefly, took salutations and all that and we returned to the airport. Ekwueme went into that place to symbolically claim his turn as president of Nigeria and it was a done deal. In 1987 Ekwueme would have become president of Nigeria. If that had happened we won\u2019t be talking about this nonsense we are still talking about today. Zoning and all that would have been long forgotten, because the point of it is to really make everybody feel belonged, feel that we all are together then when it\u2019s zoning you focus on who is the best person since everybody feels symbolically part of the project. The symbolism of what Ekwueme handed to me on that trip to Ibadan was spiritual, it was a spiritual moment, Ekwueme was simply saying to me: you are the next generation, and you, I hand the baton to. You see, Dr Alex Ekwueme was not thinking Southeast. Ekwueme in 1983 picked a group of very fine, highly intelligent Igbo boys, brought them back from America, from all other places, and put them in government to help replace older men like my former teacher who I replaced as political adviser to the president. Those were the kind of leaders who had a pan-Nigeria, pan-Igbo view, and what Ekwueme was trying to do was find competent people to supply into the pipeline of who next it will be their turn. By general calculation, Ekwueme would have been president by 1987, I probably would have been Chief of Staff to the President by 1987, it would have gone round to North, to whatever zones, probably come back. By now I would have been even the president of Nigeria and perhaps retired (laughs). I am telling you this story to show the foresight of someone like Dr Alex Ekwueme. Today, you get all these upstarts who are looking for power, they don\u2019t even know what to do with power, they don\u2019t train themselves to be competent with it, but they just want power, that is why Nigeria is prostrate, nothing is happening. They paid so little attention to how to govern and the results have come in. The chicken has come home to roost. Nigeria is not making progress; the country is on the floor. You can\u2019t see competence in people who want power; you can\u2019t see a heart for the people, a heart of service for the people.\n\nWhat is the way forward from where we are today?\n\nWe are in a very unsustainable situation right now and that is the truth of the matter. If they get away with playing this game it is somehow communicated clearly that what this game is about is to exclude the Igbo man, then you will not be able to stop the irredentism and I can tell you that there may be no Nigeria sooner than we think. I have said on different platforms that the APC and PDP should be shunned in 2023. Both parties have failed Nigeria and should not be allowed to continue to rule. When you listen to them (APC and PDP) it seems they are just competing on who has done more damage to Nigeria. I think Nigerians should just discard the two parties so that we start afresh. Nigerians have spoken in despair about the politicians of APC and PDP and their actions even now show that they can do nothing about the Nigerian condition. Let me repeat some of the things I said in our last press briefing. We must now forge a consensus and the national unity team an approach to governing during this season of a yet-to-be declared national emergency which poses an existential threat to all the parties notwithstanding. It is clear now that the democratisation of misery from the spread of insecurity, poverty, and disease has become evident to both those who think they have cornered power and those who consider themselves victims of power. There is the need for Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Niger Delta People Congress and the Middle Belt Forum to be consulted to nominate people into this unity government forum that can walk us through the evil forest of now. The long-drawn painstaking efforts to construct an alternative political track are to avoid the errors of the APC and PDP and socialise interest into clearly values and ethics of the party and train all on the basic policy planks from the vision and grand and human development ideas of the platform party of the Third Force. Our group is calling on Faith groups, and community leaders, alumni associations to seek out the members of their community and bring them forward with a suggested position they should contest.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHow would you react to the spate of insecurity that has continued to exacerbate taking into consideration the Abuja-Kaduna terrorist attack?\n\nThere is nothing surprising again to me in all of these things, I predicted, 20 years ago that these things will happen. I wasn\u2019t the one who did the analysis, it was an American called Robert Kaplan. He wrote the book: \u201cThe coming anarchy\u201d, in which he looked at the progression of ethnic, religious, and economic cleavages in West Africa and predicted a systematic descend into anarchy. And the only antidote to it is good government and the one thing we have been denied is good government. So, we have not invested in our young people to get a demographic dividend out of them and so we have created a time-bomb that has been mobilised by discontent. The more we govern badly the more the discontent in society, the easier it is to recruit people towards anarchy.\n\nWhen the government says they are on top of the security situation, how do you react to such statements?\n\n(Laughs) If they are on top of it and it is like this what will happen when they are underneath. What we are witnessing is a sad commentary.\n\nAnambra state governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, set up a reconciliation committee recently\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) I think it\u2019s a good idea, I think the more people can talk about what is hurting them the easier to heal. Nigeria needs a lot of healing and Igbo land needs plenty of healing and I have spent a lot of time the last couple of years, I operate fairly quietly. There is certainly no governor in the Southeast I haven\u2019t spent time with physically, personally, trying to persuade a certain kind of behaviour and I am hoping that the Soludo season will probably help push those efforts. I only pray for the best.\n\nCritics say that Nigeria cannot move forward, even with a good leader without restructuring? Do you share in this view?\n\nRestructuring is automatic, it is just happening whether you like it or not, Nigeria has already begun to restructure itself. There is no way you can contain the current security problem until you go to policing and when I say policing it doesn\u2019t have to be formal. The only people who can stop 300 men riding on motorcycles carrying AK47 are the local people who will prevent the people from entering into their community in the first place. We cannot but restructure, that is a natural thing that will come on its own.\n\nAre you talking about community policing?\n\nYou know that there are two different views on community policing, community policing in the classic sense of it, as police and community talking, but community policing with the community as police, a vigilante kind of it, but now designed, like in a way India organizes policing. It is a local function, funding, everything is local, but the standard, operational mode is central from the top they set all those standards and people can be promoted from the local state police into federal police service. And if things locally overwhelm local policing the federal police will come in. They are well organised.\n\nWhat type of leader can tackle the Nigerian problem?\n\nFormer President Ibrahim Babangida prescribed that type of leader a few months ago when he spoke.

He is a citizen too. So calling for his resignation from office is unnecessary.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Any attempt to use any trick and subterfuge to undermine the 2023 general polls through such dubious calls does not have our backing\u201d.",

He said the essence of humanity is love of God and love of neighbour as exemplified by the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn his Easter message to Nigerians and Imo people, Uzodinma said: \u201cAs clearly defined by Christ, the essence of our humanity is to love God and one another and be ready and willing to make sacrifices for the love of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe governor regretted that some politicians had allowed the quest for power and wealth to rob them of their humanity.

He said Christians should reflect on the purpose of Easter celebration with a renewed hope for a better Nigeria, and be a part of the process of rebuilding the country.\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential and former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim in his Easter message urged Nigerians to strengthen their commitment to love, and sacrifice for each other and Nigeria, stressing that Easter marks the greatest sacrifice ever made for the betterment of mankind when Jesus Christ offered himself to be crucified for the redemption of world.\n\nThe PDP chieftain lamented the difficulties Nigerians are passing through as a result of bad economy and worsening insecurity in the country, but expressed the hope that will God hearken to the cries of Nigerians by giving them a new set of good leaders that will lead the country from 2023.\n\nSimilarly, Chairman of the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Col.

Alfred Adewale, called on all Nigerians to embrace the wonderful message of Easter exemplified in the selfless sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered himself willingly to die on the cross of Calvary in order to redeem mankind from sin and eternal damnation, stressing that such a measure of self-sacrifice for the common good is expected of everyone, particularly those in leadership positions in the country, in order to bring about genuine progress, peace and hope for the nation at this period of excruciating pain brought about by failure of leadership over the years and the dwindling economy.\n\nOn the reality of the current desperate situation in the country, he said: \u201cThe high level of insecurity is very real in our time. The brutal killings that are reported almost on a day-to-day basis create fear and panic. The most recent are the massacres in Plateau and Benue states even as violence is reported in other parts of the country. Our government must rise up to its responsibility. The hardship that our people are facing today arise from the fact that over the years, the leadership of our country has often been concerned about parochial ethnic, religious and narrow interests instead of the common good. We must realise that individual personal good, security etc. can be assured only if the good of every individual person is attained. Both leaders and people must renounce the path of selfishness and greed that we are pursuing now. If we learn to love one another as Christ loves us, then we can build a better society where all would be able to develop and grow at their own pace and actualise their God-given visions and dreams as children of God.\u201d\n\nGeneral Overseer of The Lord\u2019s Chosen Charismatic Revival Movement, Pastor Lazarus Muoka, in his message reassured Christian faithful that by the \u201cpower of Jesus Christ\u2019s resurrection today, the challenges of humanity including physical, spiritual, political and economic challenges that are distorting the progress of man shall become eradicated.\u201d\n\nThe Bishop on the Niger, Rt Reverend Dr Owen Nwokolo advised the Federal Government to tackle insecurity frontally with the creation of job opportunities for the teeming youth population who are unemployed.\n\nBishop Nwokolo argued that since the youth constituted the vibrant segment of the population, governments at all levels should double their efforts to ensure that adequate provision was made for gainful employment, skill acquisition and also enabling environment for self-employment to properly keep the youth busy.\n\nThe Bishop said with this done, the rate of security challenges would reduce drastically across the country, adding that any government that had no clear-cut, genuine and sustainable empowerment programmes for its teeming youth would always be grappling with security challenges.\n\nIn the spirit of Easter, New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP), felicitated with Christians and appealed to Nigerians to show love and remain peaceful.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Ambassador Agbo Major, in a statement yesterday urged citizens not to give up on the country because of the economic hardship and insecurity. He said Nigerians should be willing to contribute to national development.\n\nPrimate of the Church of the Lord (Aladura) Worldwide, Most Rev. Rufus Ositelu, urged all politicians and stakeholders to let patriotism and selfless service be their watchwords throughout the electioneering campaign, during and after the forthcoming elections.\n\nOsitelu gave this advice to politicians and stakeholders in his Easter message and also urged believers to emulate Jesus Christ by living a selfless life of sacrifice and love for one another.\n\nDeputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Toby Okechukwu, opined Easter renewed the hope that Nigeria could still overcome her challenges and emerge greater and stronger through the faith, prayers, and unity of citizens, noting that the nation\u2019s woes were mainly those of misgovernance and mismanagement of her diversity.",

          "text": "\n\n* Says Nigerians tired of excuses, lamentations\n\n*We\u2019re not overwhelmed by Plateau killings, Lalong reassures\n\n*Blames crises on porous interstate borders\n\n*Terrorists have formed parallel govt, MBF laments\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nAs the country battles multiple security challenges, a frontline presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, has promised that he will deliver a united and banditry-free Nigeria if elected president.\n\n\n\nThis is as the Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\nBut the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, has stated that terrorists have formed a parallel government in Nigeria, describing the country\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\n\nSpeaking yesterday at a grand rally by the youths under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West who declared their support for his presidential aspiration at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Onikan in Lagos, the former Lagos State governor stated that Nigerians are tired of excuses and lamentations of the past.\n\n\n\nThe youths from different states in the South-west, converged on Lagos in large numbers to drum up support for the aspiration of the national leader of the party.\n\nTinubu urged them to team up with him in his bid to change the story of Nigeria for the youths of today and tomorrow, which they represent.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAll you need is courage, determination and perseverance, if the YouTube alone has 2.9 billion people following it, including you all standing here, then Nigeria can excel, we can do it, you must develop the can-do-attitude, you must believe that this country is yours and you want to change the story. You must change the story of potential, the story of banditry, you must change the story of tribalism.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed, anybody who says we cannot, they can get out because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past. We cannot continue with excuses of power failure, no nation made rapid development without electricity. Give us light and if we cannot be successful then you can abuse us, you cannot give us erratic light that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria, it is about time we have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money, long term from it. You know it. We don\u2019t want to bore you with it, when I started we used to pick dead bodies on the streets, but today Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe urged the youths to revalidate their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards and be ready to vote in the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nIn his keynote address, Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who appreciated the grand support for Tinubu, noted that youths would continue to be identified as critical stakeholders, just as he enjoined all delegates to the APC primary to exercise their franchise wisely.\n\nThe South-west youth leaders at the event took their turns to speak on why they are promoting Tinubu to become the next president of Nigeria, come 2023.\n\n\n\nSpeaking, Dr Muritala Seriki, Dayo Israel, Muhammed Sulaiman, among others applauded the achievements of Tinubu in infrastructure, education, and raising the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Lagos, while he was governor of the state, saying some of them were his products having brought them to the level they had attained presently.\n\nThis was just as they described the APC national leader as a detribalised Nigeria.\n\nWe are Not Overwhelmed by Plateau Killings, Lalong Reassures\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau State Governor, Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in the Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nLalong lamented that a planned military raid of the locations of the terrorists at the state borders may have been leaked to the terrorists who attacked the state a day earlier than the planned military operations.\n\nThe Plateau State governor, who was featured on ARISE NEWS Channel on Friday night, blamed the persistent attacks in the state on porous interstate borders, pointing out that the state government was not overwhelmed by the state of insecurity in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not say I am overwhelmed because I have been working with the security agents. But for this reason (Kanam attacks), we may say we are overwhelmed, but not overwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said one of the challenges facing the state was the long stretch of borders it has with Kaduna, Taraba, and Bauchi, saying \u201cyou may work out measures to protect your border, but some people will enter from other states, especially if the states are not doing same.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that was the reason the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) was working out a synergy \u201cso that as one state protects its borders, others do same, if not, just when you think you have done well, you will see an influx of bandits from other states.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that with the heavy military bombardments in the North-west, the terrorists are now looking for hideouts, and migrating towards states in the North-central, and vowed that Plateau will not harbour them.\n\nHe said he was not only worried about Plateau State, adding that as Chairman of NGF, but he was also worried about a region devastated by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHe added that there must be some informants that leaked the planned military operations to terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe had started having meetings on synergy to prepare to secure our borders against the terrorists, but it was like someone leaked the information. This is because the military was planning a raid on the border areas, but before we carried out the raid, they were very fast and had attacked a day earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut some of these terrorists move like thieves \u2013 thieves won\u2019t inform you before they come. They come when they know you\u2019re not awake,\u201d Lalong lamented, adding that \u201cwhen our attention was on other places, they sneaked into where we had relative peace, caused havoc and ran away.\u201d\n\nThe governor also insinuated that the terrorists may have used mining activities in the area as a cover for their sinister motives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are massive mineral deposits in the area; they may have pretended that they are there for mining activities and wreak havoc on the people. \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s where we also planned our pilot scheme on ranching; all these may have been the attraction.\u201d\n\nHe said that at a recent meeting, he reminded the Council of State that the governors had enumerated certain challenges in addressing some of the security issues in some states that were identified as frontline states in the North.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr President had directed sometimes ago that we have a meeting with the security chiefs, which we did. But shortly after that, the then Chief of Army Staff died in an accident. After his death, it took a while to come back to the issues. So, at the Council of State, I had to ask what had happened to the measures that were being put in place,\u201d Lalong explained.\n\n\n\nHe said that as a followed-up to the issues he raised at the Council of State, President Muhammadu Buhari had called for a Security Council meeting. \u201cThis is particularly because it\u2019s now farming season, and farmers need to feel secure to go back to their farms,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe governor who was in Kanam five days after the attacks, said: \u201cI drove there immediately\u201d to commiserate with the people, and to show them that the state cared much for them.\n\n\n\nPriding himself as one that has brought a measure of peace to the state in the last two decades, Lalong said he has done much in this regard. He said that on the assumption of office, he had set up an inter-religion council, established Plateau Peace Agency, mediated between Fulani and Berom, and now mediating between the Fulani and Irigwe, all of which he said had paid off by the measure of peace that was witnessed in the state before the recent attacks. He added that it\u2019s no longer the issue of farmers and herders crisis, but terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\nHe said that the white papers from the various commissions set up to address crises in the state revealed that injustice and unfairness were a major cause of the crisis, which he said has largely been addressed, and has nothing to do with the current attacks by terrorists.\n\n\n\nIn another development, the President of MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu stated that terrorists have formed parallel government in the country and described Nigeria\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\u201cWe have a parallel government out there that seems to do what it feels like, while the constituted government seems to be incapacitated. So terrorists continue to do what they want to do and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, Pogu said: \u201cConfidently I can tell you that these people are not more powerful than our military, but political forces are stopping our military from doing what are supposed to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has gone beyond the acceptable level. The unfortunate thing is that this government, because of its attitude, has pushed people into hating Fulani, because everybody now thinks Fulani are a nuisance; a people that will come and kill others in their sleep for whatever reason. But we can say that it is for displacement and taking over of ancestral lands and to change democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this thing has to stop, because if, and when it gets to a level, the innocent Fulani who may not be part of these whole attacks will pay for it. How many Fulani are there across this country; if their attack is triggered from somewhere, it will spread like wildfire and they will be wiped out. So, this government has to change its attitude and deal with these criminals, otherwise, we are heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The aspiration is to build a Trust of at least $45 billion in resources.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe RST will serve as a third pillar of the IMF\u2019s lending toolkit, in addition to the General Resources Account and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The RST will provide policy support and affordable longer maturity financing \u2013 with a 20-year maturity and a 10\u00bd -year grace period \u2013 to help build resilience against long-term risks to balance of payments stability.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added that about three-quarters of IMF\u2019s country members will be eligible for RST financing.\n\n\u201cAbout three-quarters of the IMF\u2019s country members will be eligible for RST financing, including low-income members as well as most middle-income countries and all small developing states. We have worked extensively with our members and other stakeholders to design the RST, to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowers,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have worked extensively with our members and other stakeholders to design the RST, to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowers.

          "text": "Our reporters\n\nAs Christians in Nigeria join their counterparts all over the world to celebrate Easter, governors across the country and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday have urged them to pray against insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his Easter message, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi called on Nigerians to always embrace unity and love as well as be hopeful for a better Nigeria after the current parlous state.\n\n\n\nFayemi, in the message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode, urged Christians to emulate the sacrificial lifestyle of Jesus Christ who gave His life to save mankind.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, charged Christians to use the occasion of the celebration of Easter to pray for an end to insurgency in the state.\n\nBello said fervent prayers, coupled with the efforts being made by the government would lead to the restoration of peace in areas bedevilled by insurgency.\n\n\n\nIn the message signed on his behalf by the Chief Press Secretary, Mrs Mary Noel Berje, Governor Bello said the state was witnessing trying moments, adding that \u201cwe need to strengthen our resolve to collectively confront the challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has also urged the Christian faithful to emulate Jesus Christ by making sacrifices that would engender development and ensure lasting peace and unity in the country.\n\n\n\nObaseki, in his Easter message, urged Christians to reflect on the purpose of the Easter celebration with a renewed hope for a better Nigeria, and be a part of the process of rebuilding the country.\n\n\n\nOyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, urged Christians to imbibe the lessons of love, sacrificial living and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\n\nThe governor, in an Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, stated that prayers of God\u2019s people remained an important ingredient to sustaining the peace and prosperity being witnessed in the state.\n\n\n\nKwara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq also urged the Christian community in the state to use the Easter festivities as a period of reunion, self-discipline, sacrifice, forgiveness, and commitment to God.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued in Ilorin by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor also called on Nigerians to take advantage of the period to seek God\u2019s favour for the country and to reunite against all forces of evil who seek to tear the country apart and terrorise its people with violence and economic sabotage.\n\n\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has also called on Christians to pray for socio-economic and political rejuvenation of Nigeria to stem insecurity, and political and economic challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\n\nOkowa made the call in his Easter message contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika.\n\nHe asserted that the turbulence in the polity could only be surmounted through dedicated prayers by Nigerians, adding that with prayer at Easter, challenges bedevilling the country would be overcome.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has called on the people of the state and indeed all Nigerians to take advantage of the historic event to advance peace, intensify prayers and commit themselves to God.\n\n\n\nIn his Easter message, Ugwuanyi applauded Christians for the successful conclusion of the forty-day long Lenten season.\n\n\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has also stated that the Easter celebration offers Nigerians the opportunity to rethink the essence of their humanity in true reflection of love, forgiveness, peace, reconciliation, brotherliness and sacrifice, all of which Jesus Christ symbolises.\n\n\n\nOn its part, PDP has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of Easter to rekindle their hope for a brighter future and a national rebirth under a coming democratic and people-oriented government. Easter, the PDP said is the celebration of the victory of life over death, that offers the opportunity to further strengthen the resolve to rescue the nation from the forces of death, suffering and misrule that have held her hostage in the last seven years.\n\n\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, \u201cSuch forces have in the last seven years divided and suppressed Nigerians, arrogantly instituted lies, propaganda, deceit, disregard for the rule of law, intimidation and violation of human rights as official policies of State; brought untold economic hardship and acute poverty as a weapon of suppression and mass destruction, pillaged our national treasury with impunity, opened our nation to terrorists and look the other way as outlaws take over territories and daily massacre our citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Pardon All Thieves in Prison, SANs Tell Buhari, Knock President over Dariye, Nyame",
          "text": "\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThree Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs), Chief Mike Ozekhome, Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Jibrin Okutepa, have faulted the state pardon granted to former Governors Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to pardon other thieves in prison.\n\n\n\nThe former governors, who were jailed for corruption, were pardoned alongside 157 others at the Council of State meeting presided over by President Buhari on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe action by the government, has however come under strong criticisms by many Nigerians, including Ozekhome.\n\nOzekhome, in faulting the action of the president queried the basis for granting the pardon when the charge of corruption upon which they were convicted is not only a bane in the country but \u201cstruts around imperiously like a peacock\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn a statement titled: \u2018Legal and Moral Implications of Granting Pardon to Ex-convicts and Serving Prisoners,\u2019 the senior lawyer was of the opinion that the decision to free the two governors who are still serving their jail terms was not in the interest of the people and capable of dampening the confidence of the citizenry in the national moral fabric, and in the fight against corruption.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cBy granting pardon to these treasury looters, Buhari is reviving, nurturing and watering corruption with state powers\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, when the Council of State recently authorised the pardon of 159 convicts, including Senator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and ex-Governor Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were both imprisoned for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, many Nigerians justifiably showed anger, because these two political leaders had been duly tried and convicted for stealing money belonging to their respective states\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\nThe senior lawyer maintained that the purpose of criminal prosecution is to secure justice, not only for the accused, but also for the victims of crimes and the state; and to some extent get reparation and restitution for the victims, while deterring others from going the same route.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere lies the justice for the impoverished people of Plateau and Taraba States who will now watch their tormentors stroll out with red carpet treatment?\n\n\u201cThe government budgets huge sums of money for the prosecution of such accused persons from the tax players\u2019 sweat; and if after the rigorous period of trial and subsequent conviction, the guilty are simply let off the hook in such a brazen manner, the little remaining lean hope the citizens have in the system is further diminished\u201d, he added.\n\n\n\nWhile stating that both the president and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges, Ozekhome explained that a constitutional issue as volatile as this could have been better managed if the minders of the president had told him the embarrassment this could cause the government in the estimation of the comity of nations.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Falana, speaking during the one year remembrance programme for the late Publicity Secretary of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Yinka Odumakin, described the release of the former governors as discriminatory.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that it was wrong to grant state pardon to the two of them who were convicted for stealing state funds.\n\n\n\nFalana said under the 1999 constitution, there is equality for all citizens, adding that the state pardon has to be extended to all thieves and criminals serving jail terms in various prisons.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy reaction is that all criminals, all thieves and criminals in our prisons should be released.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause Section 17 of the Constitution says there shall be equality, equal rights for all citizens and section 42 said there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class, gender, whatever, so you can\u2019t take out two people and leave the rest there. It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he might be forced to ask lawyers whose clients are still in prison to go to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment.\n\nFalana suggested that the 1999 constitution should be referred to as decree 24 on 1999 as \u201cit was not duly signed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat the National Assembly has continued to do is to amend illegality. The so-called 1999 constitution is really decree 24 of 1999. When you see the so-called constitution, you will not the signature of the man who signed the law, that\u2019s the fraud.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you see a law, the name of the person who signed it should be there with the date.\n\n\u201cDecree 24 of 1999 was promulgated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar on the 5th of May 1999 but today you will not see his name on it. It\u2019s a fraudulent document.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe decree was imposed on us the last set of military dictators in Nigeria headed by Gen. Abubakar and because that document is okay for members of the ruling class regardless of their political parties, ethic regional or religious inclination, they are all comfortable with the document so they can\u2019t do anything about it including all those we are campaigning today to be President.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is to retain the status quo and perhaps adjust it here and there, that is the only thing they are saying, so those who are contesting particularly on the platform of the ruling party are saying we are going to continue the programme of the Buhari administration that has put our country in problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria has become a huge joke in the committee of nations and so for any set of people to say they want to package his rickety vehicle and begin to panel beat it, it\u2019s not going to move.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okutepa faulted the presidential pardon granted to Dariye and Nyame.\n\nHe wondered why president Buhari granted the pardon despite his lamentations that corruption is affecting Nigeria\u2019s growth.\n\n\n\nWhile speaking during an interview, he said: \u201cWe are all aware of the reasons they were arraigned and found guilty by the Supreme Court. They are politically exposed people in our society.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things that has retarded the growth of Nigeria today is corruption. It is the best enterprise in Nigeria today. So, when I heard that Buhari agreed to pardon the ex-governors, I weep for this country. The reason is that the mantra for which this person came to power is that of corruption.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe duty of the Nigerian government is to fight and eradicate corruption. Corruption has become so cancerous and all hands must be on deck to fight it. I am so upset by the decision because the ex-governor of Plateau State has his appeal dismissed in March 2021 by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this country, the executive had on a series of occasions said that one of the things affecting the fight against corruption is the judiciary, so if the judiciary, therefore, enforces the provisions of the law and sends the ex-governors to prison, why does the executive sabotage its own law.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Withdraw Pardon For Thieving Ex-Governors Dariye, Nyame Now, SERAP Tells Buhari",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon recently granted to former governors of Plateau and Taraba states, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame respectively, serving jail terms for corruption.\n\n\n\nSERAP urged Buhari to use his \u201cgood offices to urgently review and withdraw the pardon granted to former governors of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye, and Taraba State, Rev Jolly Nyame who are serving jail terms for corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe group in a letter dated April 16, 2022, and signed by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare also urged the President to \u201cpropose constitutional amendment to the National Assembly to reform the provisions on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy to make the provisions more transparent, and consistent and compatible with Nigeria\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\nMr Dariye and Mr Nyame were jailed for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion respectively. However, the National Council of State last week endorsed the pardon of Mr Dariye, Mr Nyame and 157 others serving jail terms following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.\n\nIn the letter, SERAP said: \u201cImpunity for corruption will continue as long as influential politicians escape justice for their crimes. The constitutional power of prerogative of mercy ought not to be an instrument of impunity.\n\n\u201cThe pardon power ought to be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], particularly the provisions on oath of office by public officers, and section 15[5] which requires your government to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the presidential pardon power must be exercised in good faith, and in line with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution on fundamental rights.\n\n\u201cWe would like your government to clarify if the pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame would entitle them to the return of the stolen assets already forfeited to the government.\n\n\u201cThe pardon also constitutes an interference in the exercise of judicial power. Because the pardon appears to be arbitrary, it undermines the authority and independence of the judiciary, and access to justice for victims of corruption.\"\n\nThe letter, copied to the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, also read in part: \u201cThe pardon is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution, and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption.\n\n\u201cPresidential pardon for corruption cases is inconsistent with the rule of law, and the public interest, as it undermines the principle of equality before the law. It will undermine public confidence in your government\u2019s fight against corruption, and the justice system.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that while the pardon power is routinely exercised to shield influential politicians and politically exposed persons from justice and accountability, ordinary people who have committed petty offences but with no money or influential politicians to speak for them, languish in prisons and are rarely considered for pardon.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no doubt that Section 175 of the Constitution vests wide discretionary power in the Nigerian president to grant pardon, it does not stipulate the conditions under which such power should be exercised.\n\n\u201cHowever, when section 15(5) of the Constitution is read together with the oath, it would seem to impose some ethical conditions on you to ensure that the exercise of the discretionary power of prerogative of mercy is not such that it will encourage corruption or impunity of perpetrators.\u201d\n\nAccording to the organisation, Dariye and Nyame should have been allowed to complete their jail terms.\n\nIt described the presidential pardon as \"unfair and undeserving.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt further said, \u201cThe investigation and prosecution of the corruption cases involving the pardoned former governors Dariye and Nyame reportedly cost over N300 million of taxpayers\u2019 money. The cases went from the High Court to the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cSection 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018The State shall abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u2019 Similarly, article 26 of the UN Convention against Corruption requires your government to ensure \u2018effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions\u2019 in cases of grand corruption.\n\n\u201cArticle 26 of the convention complements the more general requirement of article 30, paragraph 1, that sanctions must take into account the gravity of the corruption offences.\n\n\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that in your inaugural speech on May 29, 2015, you stated that, \u2018We are going to tackle pervasive corruption head-on. Nigerians will not regret that they have entrusted national responsibility to us.'\n\n\u201cHowever, the latest Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index shows that Nigeria scored 24 out of 100 points, and ranked 154 out of 180 countries surveyed, falling back five places from the rank of 149 in 2020. This places Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in West Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pardon power, if properly exercised, can help to protect citizens against possible miscarriage of justice.\n\n\u201cSERAP, therefore, urges you to urgently withdraw the presidential pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame, and to propose an amendment to section 175 of the Nigerian Constitution that will make the exercise of the power to pardon more transparent and consistent and compatible with the country\u2019s international obligations.\n\n\u201cAny proposed amendment should also empower the citizens to challenge the legality of any arbitrary exercise of the power of prerogative of mercy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian Lady Shares Sexual Assault Experience At Tanzanian Hotel During Vacation",
          "text": "A young lady, Zainab Oladehinde, has shared her horrific experience at the Beach Hotel Nungwi, Zanzibar, Tanzania.\n\nIn a Twitter thread on Saturday, Oladehinde said she was sexually assaulted by a stranger despite having locked the door to her hotel room.\n\n\n\nThe young lady said she was almost raped by the stranger but lied she was HIV positive, a move that stopped the attacker from penetrating.\n\nWhile making efforts to nab the culprit, Oladehinde said she reported to the police but the complain was dismissed after a medical report established that there was no penetration.\n\nShe also said that owner of the hotel put the blame on her and claimed that she was lying.\n\nShe wrote, \"This incident happened a year ago in April of 2021. I haven\u2019t been able to talk about it cause I\u2019ve been in therapy for a year to heal from the psychological trauma.\n\n\"This experience has been the most painful and traumatic I\u2019ve ever faced in my entire life.\n\n\"On the 15th of April 2021, I flew from Lagos, Nigeria to Zanzibar, Tanzania, for my 23rd birthday and I was extremely excited about it. I had my reservations about going to a foreign country as a solo female traveller but none of my thoughts would have prepared me for what I eventually witnessed and experienced in Tanzania.\n\n\n\n\"It was a two-day flight as we had a one-day transit time in Adis Ababa, Ethiopia. I arrived at my hotel, Warere Beach Hotel in Nungwi, Zanzibar, on the 16th of April, 2021 in the afternoon around 4pm.\n\n\"I had booked a night (of) accommodation. On getting to the hotel, I was welcomed by the staff and they showed me my room which had a pool and sea view.\n\n\"Now, this looked like heaven to me and I can remember being so excited as this was going to be my dream birthday holiday. I couldn\u2019t do much except eat dinner as I was tired from my flight and I just wanted to sleep. My itinerary the next day was to spend some time exploring the hotel whilst I settle fully into vacation mode before I\u2019d start my tourist activities which I never got the time to do\n\n\"I had breakfast and went to the pool and the beach which were very nice. I mingled with some Russian couples who were also lodged at the hotel and, by evening time, I was already in full birthday mode as it was just a few hours to my birthday.\n\n\"At around 12:00am, a few friends and family called to wish me a happy birthday and then I went back to my room to sleep. A few hours into my sleep, I started to feel a strange hand touching my breast.\n\n\u201cNow, this was me sleeping naked on my bed in my hotel room with my doors locked so this was definitely a dream.\n\n\"I told myself and went back to sleep a few minutes afterwards.\n\n\"I started to feel my hands stroking someone\u2019s penis. At this moment, I opened my eyes to confirm if It was actually a dream or if I was in real danger.\n\n\"Lo and behold, it wasn\u2019t a dream. There was a naked man lying on my bed and touching me at 2:00am in my hotel room!\n\n\"He started calling me \u201cbab\u201d and then I became scared cause the room was dark as I had switched off the lights before I went to bed. Now, I was extremely scared.\n\n\"I asked the man \u201cwho are you?\u201d But all he kept saying was \u201cbaby, baby\u201d. I asked in a louder tone this time around cause I was getting angry and then he quickly stuffed his hands over my mouth in an attempt to stop me from shouting.\n\n\"At this moment, I became very scared as I didn\u2019t know who this was and why this person was in my room.\n\n\"A lot of things were going through my head at the same time. Who is this? Does he have a weapon? Will I get raped and killed on my birthday in a strange land?\n\n\"How did this man get into my room? Should I struggle for my life? Will he rape me and throw me into the ocean directly opposite my room? Should I let him rape me so he may spare my life? Should I run? Will he chase me?\n\n\"Who else is outside my door? Is he the only one? Does he have a knife? Will he stab me? While all this was going through my head, this man tried to climb on top of me in an attempt to force his penis inside of me.\n\n\"At this point, I became scared cause he was stinking so badly and that was the only thing I could smell.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t see his face so I started touching his body so I\u2019d get some clarity on how to identify him if I ever get out of my room alive.\n\n\"I was crying profusely now and needed to find a quick way to distract him so I started begging him not to rape me but he didn\u2019t understand English as he kept on speaking Swahili to me. I then lied to him that I have HIV and he\u2019d need to get a condom before sleeping with me.\n\n\"He didn\u2019t understand a word I said but immediately he heard HIV, he paused for a while.\n\n\"I quickly wanted to use the opportunity to run but then he started strangling my neck. I became very scared for my life as I saw my life flash right before me in an instant.\n\n\"So I continued begging him and telling him I\u2019d allow him to have sex with me but he\u2019d need to go get a condom so as not to get HIV.\n\n\"I saw that he reacted to the word \u201cHIV\u201d so I kept on saying HIV whilst crying profusely at this point.\n\n\"His belt fell off the bed so I got an instant feeling that this man came into my room fully clothed before removing his clothes right on my bed. He wore his shoes and came back to press my neck against the bed.\n\n\"As I struggled to not let him strangle me, he left the room and told me he\u2019d be back with a condom.\n\n\"Immediately he left, I switched on the light, tried to call hotel reception but to my surprise there were no intercom or phone lines to reach the hotel reception through the room.\n\n\"How can there be no phones in the room in a hotel that was supposedly a 4.5-star hotel in Zanzibar?\n\n\"I immediately locked my doors, ran to the bathroom, and called my friend. I couldn\u2019t talk well cause I was just crying but finally I could speak and then we decided I couldn\u2019t stay back in the room and wait for the rapist to come back. Hell!\n\n\"Who knows what would happen to me this time around when he comes back to my room. Should I leave my room? I don\u2019t know who or what is outside my hotel room either!\n\n\"All these thoughts I had while I tried to call the police but no one was responding to their calls. Then I sent a message to the hotel\u2019s owner whom I had been speaking with weeks before my trip.\n\n\"I decided it was very unsafe for me to remain in the room. If I\u2019d die, I\u2019d rather die trying to escape rather than let the man come back to attack me a second time in my room.\n\n\"I quickly put some clothes on and left my room barefooted so as not to make noise when I get out.\n\n\"On getting outside the room, I wanted to make my way to the reception but then I saw two men who happened to be security men standing outside by the poolside having a conversation.\n\n\"I wanted to go meet them to tell them I had just been attacked by a stranger in my room but I thought to myself, \u201cwhat if this was the person (s) who actually attacked me? \u201d\n\n\"I became extremely scared cause I\u2019d have to find a way to get to the reception without those men seeing me.\n\n\"Then I started to crawl on my knees chest around the leaves so no one could see me. When I got to the hotel reception, I knocked on every door but no one answered me. I was crying profusely at this point cause I thought I wouldn\u2019t survive this night.\n\n\"How could it be that there was no one in all these rooms at the reception? Almost immediately, I remembered the Russian couple I had spent some time with the day before and I could go to their room to seek refuge.\n\n\"The only issue was that the security men were directly opposite their room and I might get noticed if I go there. At this point, I put my phone on silence and started crawling on my chest till I got to their room\n\n\"I hoped their room wouldn\u2019t be locked so, in case I get noticed, I would be able to call for help before anything happens to me.\n\n\"Fortunately for me, the room was opened and I ran inside. They woke up almost immediately and I told the guy \u2018Alex \u2018 how I was strangled and almost got raped in my room.\n\n\"He advised that I stay in his room till we sort out the issue by daybreak. I called my friend to tell him I was in another room where I felt safe and he told me had called the hotel owner. This was around 4:00am in the morning.\n\n\"At 6:00am in the morning, I left Alex\u2019s room and went back to the reception. Still didn\u2019t find anyone there. I called my taxi driver, Mr Suley, to come to pick me up and take me to the police station as I waited at the hotel reception/restaurant.\n\n\"I waited there for over two hours before I was attended to by the hotel manager, Mussa. He claimed to have received a phone call around 4:00am by the hotel\u2019s owner to go check for me in my room after my friend had called them. He said he didn\u2019t find me in the room so he went back to bed.\n\n\"My phone battery was low at this point, so I had to go back to my room to pick up my charger. On getting to my room, I checked my bag where I had kept my money and then I realised my money was missing!\n\n\"I was super livid at this point. Not only did these people try to rape and kill me, but they also stole my $1,100. I had one thousand, one hundred dollars in my bag and it was gone also.\n\n\"I told Mussa to call out all the security personnel that was on duty the night before so we\u2019d get the hang of who the culprit was. They all came out. I couldn\u2019t recognise any of them but I could smell the man that was in my room that midnight.\n\n\"The taxi driver arrived and we all left for the police station. The hotel manager and owner still hadn\u2019t reached out to me yet. When I was talking and telling the staff that I was sexually assaulted and strangled that midnight, they all acted nonchalant about my story.\n\n\"When we got to the police station, I was asked to write my statement which I did. The policemen asked me to narrate the incident to them and they advised that I go to the hospital to do a check-up to see if I was raped or not.\n\n\"They were all speaking Swahili and were asking me questions instead of interrogating the suspects.\n\n\"When I decided to take a picture of the police station and the statement I had written, the policemen started shouting at me and threatening me to delete the pictures I have.\n\n\"I stood my ground and said I wouldn\u2019t delete any pictures. The police chief at the Nungwi Police Station then said he wouldn\u2019t let them take me to the hospital for a checkup if I don\u2019t delete my pictures and videos.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t delete my pictures and videos. Instead, I took more because this was the only weapon I had against them. I started to google Nigerian embassies in Tanzania. I called all of them but no one answered.\n\n\"They finally let me go to the hospital for a checkup.\n\n\"When we got to the hospital, the nurse confirmed that there was no penetration.\n\n\"I got back to the police station and the policemen said they have no issue with the sexual assault since I wasn\u2019t raped. That the only issue here was my stolen money.\n\n\"The policemen at the Nungwi Police Station in Zanzibar kept on bullying and harassing me. They told me to leave their police station that I wasn\u2019t raped and they had confirmed there was no penetration from the nurses.\n\n\"This was 3:00pm already. This day was my birthday.\n\n\"My friends and family back in Lagos didn\u2019t know all that was happening to me in Zanzibar. I was so frustrated, sad, and scared. How could the police do this to me? How could the hotel do this to me?\n\n\"One of the Russian couples narrates how I ran into their room to seek refuge in the middle of the night when the security men at Warere Beach Hotel Nungwi Zanzibar Tanzania busted into my room.\n\n\"The hotel has closed off its comment section on Instagram but I won\u2019t stop till everyone boycotts this crazy hotel.\n\n\"The owner and manager said I lied about my experience.\"\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "In the wake of explosive accusations against Africa\u2019s most valuable startup, Flutterwave co-founder speaks",
          "text": "Former CEO of Africa\u2019s most valuable startup Flutterwave, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, has responded to the recent allegations of fraud and insider trading levelled against the company\u2019s management and current CEO and co-founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nThe accusations were laid out in an article by David Hundeyin, and a Medium post by Clara Wanjiku.\n\nWhile both Wanjiku and Hundeyin\u2019s articles raised important questions about the culture, ethics, and governance at Flutterwave, Aboyeji claims no privileged insight into the company after his time there. He however addressed concerns raised about things that happened while he was CEO of the payment giant.\n\nOne of the many actions Agboola was accused of was creating a ghost \u201cco-founder\u201d identity, who went by the name Greg, to give himself more shares, in the company\u2019s early days. To this, Aboyeji told TechCabal that the agreement between the co-founders was that Agboola would hold some shares in trust for the fictitious Greg.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, I was told there\u2019s a chief technology officer named Greg, who\u2019s from MIT, whom I\u2019d meet someday. It never happened,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cAfter a while, it became clear what had happened. By that time it didn\u2019t matter. We [Aboyeji and third co-founder Adeleke Adekoya] had already signed agreements, and I decided to just move on.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, on Wednesday, April 13, Aboyeji had put out a series of tweets, aimed at distancing himself from any involvement in the allegations levelled at Agboola and Flutterwave. He said, in one of them, that some of the allegations made could prevent him from being a company director, and thus affect his livelihood.\n\nHe also said that Hundeyin, the article\u2019s author, didn\u2019t reach out to him for comment.\n\nThe article alleged that Agboola did not resign from his job as Head of Digital Factory and Innovation at Access Bank before working at Flutterwave. It said Aboyeji had been a co-conspirator who had testified, alongside Agboola and Access Bank CEO Herbert Wigwe, before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under oath, that Agboola never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank.\n\nAboyeji\u2019s time as CEO\n\nLaunched in 2016 as a Nigerian and US-based payments company, with offices in Lagos and San Francisco, Flutterwave was co-founded by Agboola, Adekoya, and Aboyeji, who had earlier co-founded Andela. TechCabal obtained a copy of Flutterwave\u2019s US certificate of incorporation, prepared by Aboyeji on May 2, 2016.\n\nFlutterwave started when Aboyeji met the other co-founders Agboola and Adekoya while still at Andela.\n\nAccess Bank had hired an engineer from Andela to work on a product that later turned out to be PayWithCapture, a mobile payment solution that permitted customers to make payments by scanning a merchant\u2019s pre-generated QR code using their phone cameras.\n\nAfter a series of conversations about the African payment landscape, Aboyeji, Agboola, and Adekoya teamed up to start Flutterwave, to solve the challenges with African payment. Agboola and Adekoya had the ideas; Aboyeji came on board to execute.\n\nIn the early days of Flutterwave, the co-founders were still working at their previous jobs. Aboyeji explained that although the trio had agreed to a transition timeline towards working on Flutterwave full-time, there were challenges with adhering to that timeline. Flutterwave investors were made aware that Agboola and Adekoya had transitioned from working for the bank to consulting for the Africa Fintech Foundry through an investor update.\n\n\u201cMy co-founders informed me that they\u2019ve resigned from Access Bank, but they had to give some notice to the bank, and since they were handling sensitive positions at Access Bank, what ended up happening was they became consultants to Africa Fintech Foundry,\u201d Aboyeji said. Africa Fintech Foundry is an initiative by Access Bank that nurtures and accelerates the growth of fintech startups in Africa.\n\nAboyeji described the relationship between Access Bank and Flutterwave as a mutually beneficial one. Access Bank was the budding fintech\u2019s banking partner and Flutterwave helped introduce the bank to its Silicon Valley network.\n\nHe also disclosed that, early on, when the company started, there were ongoing conversations with Access Bank to invest in Flutterwave, but due to Nigerian banking regulations that prohibited banks from getting involved in non-banking activities, the deal couldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of Flutterwave was as a result of the collaboration between a bank and the local tech ecosystem. I think that\u2019s an incredible learning opportunity,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to Access Bank to comment on their relationship with Flutterwave\u2019s founders but hasn\u2019t gotten a response as of press time.\n\nSEC investigation\n\nIn an investor update obtained by TechCabal, covering Flutterwave\u2019s activities from May 2016 to June 2017, Flutterwave\u2019s investors were informed that the SEC had opened an investigation into the company and its investors.\n\nAs seen in a legal brief by Orrick, a US law firm, Flutterwave had 85 investors, and there was concern that some of them were not qualified to be investors under US law.\n\n\u201cTo invest in a startup in the US, you have to be a US resident, an international investor who can claim to be a Reg S investor or a close family, friend, or employee of founders,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cThe SEC were concerned about whether we had followed the right process in making sure the investors were accredited. We proved that every investor was profiled and qualified under the required exemptions.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s initial enquiries, further investigation on Flutterwave, as related to this matter was closed, according to a letter from the SEC dated September 28, 2017. There was no other investigation made by the SEC outside of this incident during his tenure as CEO, according to Aboyeji.\n\nChange of name\n\nAfter the initial fictitious Greg co-founder incident, there were accusations of instances where Agboola often changed his first name to Greg when communicating with external parties.\n\nAboyeji acknowledged being aware of this happening on a few occasions, stating that it sometimes happened when Agboola, who was already well known as an Access Bank employee\u2014but now with Flutterwave\u2014needed to engage with other banks.\n\n\u201cThat was the context to which I understood him using Greg. Otherwise, as a result of the hostility among banks, other banks can just say, \u2018You\u2019re from Access Bank, we will not use you.\u2019 While we\u2019re not Access Bank. We\u2019re Flutterwave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nExiting Flutterwave\n\nIn October 2018, when the news broke out that Aboyeji was stepping down from his role as Flutterwave CEO, there were rumours that all wasn\u2019t well, and that he had been fired. Aboyeji explained to TechCabal that his departure was due to differing opinions with Agboola on how the company should be run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. GB [Agboola] and I started butting heads,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cHe wanted input on things that I felt were my responsibilities, and he didn\u2019t want input on things he felt were his responsibilities. And I said there can\u2019t be two captains of this ship.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September 2018, during a board meeting, Aboyeji stated that he wanted to leave the company and suggested that Agboola, who was then Chief Product Officer, be brought in as a product-focused CEO.\n\nAboyeji offered to leave Flutterwave within 6 months, to allow for a smooth transition. But the board said that there was no need for that, suggesting he could hand over immediately.\n\n\u201cI thought it was rather sudden, but I agreed because I already wanted to leave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nAfter a few weeks of negotiating the terms of his exit, on October 12, 2018, Aboyeji sent an email announcing his decision to resign as CEO and board member at Flutterwave. A copy of this email was shared with TechCabal.\n\nAboyeji maintains that his exit followed due process and that he currently doesn\u2019t own a stake in the company; he also insists he wasn\u2019t forced to sell his shares at a lower price.\n\n\u201cHow can someone force me to do that? I didn\u2019t sell my shares to GB [Agboola]. I sold my shares to a third party. I fully exited Flutterwave at the $1 billion valuation round last year.\u201d\n\nAboyeji also shared his thoughts on past Flutterwave employee Clara Wanjiku\u2019s recent account of Flutterwave neglecting to remove her as the contact person on their M-Pesa account, resulting in the police hounding Wanjiku and her family after the account recorded a fraudulent transaction.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think it was intentional. Based on his experience, the company\u2019s negligence was due to not having a process to properly off-board employees when they leave.\n\n\u201cI kept getting Flutterwave bank alerts for over a year after I left,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cI\u2019ve run into trouble with the authorities because Flutterwave still had me listed as a point of contact, long after I left.\u201d\n\nThese allegations come 2 months after Flutterwave raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion in just 12 months.\n\nCommenting on the allegations raised in Hundeyin\u2019s article, Flutterwave shared this response with TechCabal:\n\n\u201cThe blog post in question is based on recycled and previously addressed claims, and several others that are false. As part of our commitment to operating an ethically responsible company in compliance with all applicable laws, we take all claims of this nature seriously, and are conducting a thorough review. We will take action as and when appropriate. This enables us to maintain the highest workplace standards and remain focused on our mission to create financial possibilities for companies and consumers across Africa.\u201d\n\nLed by Agboola, Flutterwave has grown to become a beacon of success in the African tech ecosystem, with Agboola seen as not just a successful entrepreneur but a notable investor in the African startup space.\n\nIn its last fundraising announcement in February, the company revealed that 900,000 businesses globally use Flutterwave to process payments, in 150 currencies, up from 290,000 businesses, as at March 2021. This threefold increase means that the African payment giant has now processed 140 million transactions worth more than $9 billion since its inception.\n\nUpdates: Flutterwave\u2019s response to the allegations were added to this story by 11:00 PM GMT+1 on April 16, 2022\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is an advertiser with and sponsor of several TechCabal properties.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

But, it hasn\u2019t been easy! And honestly, I\u2019ve been looking forward to today.\n\nSo, aside from the fact that it\u2019s Good Friday, I must say that it will be a good one for me because I\u2019ll get plenty of rest and possibly watch some Netflix and chill.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m available for enjoyment this weekend!

I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Global financial institution, the World Bank has warned in its latest \u2018Africa\u2019s Pulse\u2019 report, a biannual analysis of the near-term regional macroeconomic outlook, that Nigeria\u2019s increasing fuel subsidy could pose debt sustainability concerns for the country.\n\nThe warning comes on the heels of the national assembly approval of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request to earmark N4 trillion for petrol subsidy.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution noted that the rising cost of subsidies could also weaken the country\u2019s public finance.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cRisk remains high on increasing fuel subsidies, which could weigh heavily on public finance and pose debt sustainability concerns.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, public debt as a percentage of GDP is currently moderate.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution added that the country\u2019s soaring military spending and debt servicing costs could prey on the country\u2019s debt sustainability level.\n\n\u201cPersistent fuel subsidies, increasing military spending for security purposes, and rising debt servicing costs weigh heavily on public finance to keep public debt at a sustainable level in Nigeria,\u201d the report added.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal balance deteriorated considerably in several Sub-Saharan African countries as governments scaled-up spending to mitigate the prolonged effects of the pandemic on firms and vulnerable households.\u201d\n\nOn sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s recovery, the bank noted that it is multi-speed, with wide variation across countries.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of the three largest economies in the region \u2014 Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola \u2014 will continue to be sluggish,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cHigh oil prices will support growth in Nigeria and Angola.\n\n\u201cExcluding Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, growth is projected at 4.1 per cent in 2022\u2014higher than the growth of the region as a whole.\n\n\u201cNon-resource-rich countries are projected to be adversely affected by rising commodity prices, dragging down growth in the region.\n\n\u201cThe opposite occurs with resource-rich countries whose growth would be propelled by favourable terms of trade.\u201d\n\nThe bank further said the war in Ukraine would further improve the economic performance of resource-rich countries (especially their extractive sector) and decelerate the economic activity of non-resource-rich countries as their import bills soar.\n\n\u201cGiven limited trade exposure, the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are expected to be negligible,\u201d the bank added.\n\nIt projected a 2.7 per cent growth for Nigeria in 2022.\n\n\u201cOf the region\u2019s three largest economies, South Africa\u2019s growth is expected to decline by 2.8 percentage points in 2022, dragged by persistent structural constraints, while Angola and Nigeria are projected to continue with the momentum of 2021, up by 2.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, thanks partly to elevated oil prices and good performance of the non-oil sector,\u201d the bank said.\n\nAccording to World Bank, growth in Nigeria is forecast to increase to 3.8 per cent in 2022 and stabilise at 4 per cent from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\u201cReal GDP growth was revised up by 1.2 percentage points for both periods compared with the previous forecast. Nigeria\u2019s economy is still dependent on the oil sector,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOil-related revenue contributes 40 to 60 per cent of fiscal revenue, while oil and gas account for 80 to 90 per cent of total exports. Weak oil production, below the OPEC quota, held back the recovery process.\n\n\u201cAlthough at a slower pace than the average 7 per cent during the boom period, growth prospects for the Nigerian economy are somewhat bright thanks to high oil prices coupled with reforms initiated by the passing of the Petroleum Industry Act and the completion of the Dangote refinery expected in 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "Electoral Act 2022: Loopholes Allow Aspirants To Run For President, Senate At Same Time",
          "text": "State governors relying on loopholes in the electoral law allowing them to run for president and at the same time forging a backup plan to snatch their party\u2019s senatorial tickets or, in some cases, re-election tickets may be in for a rude shock.\n\nThe ambiguity which Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, successfully took advantage of under the 2010 Electoral Act might be a hard nut to crack under the new Act signed by President Muhammadu Buhari recently.\n\nYet feelers from states like Bauchi, Sokoto, Rivers, Ebonyi, Cross Rivers and Akwa Ibom suggest some governors believe the feat could still be achieved.\n\nThe 2022 Electoral Act may have sealed the fate of some of these governors who already jumped into the presidential race and can no longer participate in party primaries for either governor of senator.\n\nSection 29(1) of the 2022 Electoral Act reads: \u201cEvery political party shall, not less than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the Commission, in the prescribed Forms, the list of candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u201d\n\nSection 33 reads: \u201cA political party shall not be allowed to change or substitute its candidate whose name has been submitted under section 29 of this Act, except in case of death or withdrawal by candidates.\u201d\n\nYet, section 31 of the same Act allows a candidate to withdraw his or her candidacy in writing and deliver personally by the candidate to the political party that nominated him.\n\nThis must however be conveyed to INEC not later than 90 days to the election.\n\nCuriously, while the Act is silent on how and if such a candidate who withdraws 90 days to the election can be replaced, the silence, along with the timing and if the section is read together with section 33, suggests there is no room for replacement.\n\nSome senior lawyers who spoke with LEADERSHIP Sunday on the knotty issue yesterday said if indeed there is such a provision allowing a candidate to seek one ticket and is given another in the Electoral Act 2022, it should be challenged in court.\n\nA learned silk, Abdul Balogun (SAN), said such a loophole in a provision of the Electoral Act may cause confusion during the electoral process.\n\nHe said, \u201dIf indeed such provision is in the Electoral Act, it should be challenged in court because it will end up causing confusion during the electoral process.\n\n\u201dNigeria cannot afford to make mistake that would set the country on fire and how do we avoid that? It is by putting the right laws in place that will guide the conduct of the election. Once this is done, we will have a free, fair and credible election in 2023.\u201d\n\nOn his part, a constitutional lawyer, Mumuni Badewole, said it is unheard of in the history of election in the country.\n\nHe agreed with the learned senior advocate that something urgently should be done to avert constitutional crisis.\n\nBut the dice may have already been rolled in Bauchi where Barrister Ibrahim Kashim, a former secretary to the state government has become the face of the PDP in the race for the 2023 governorship election.\n\nParty officials in the state are however doing everything possible to sideline and ignore the aspirations of a second contender for the PDP ticket, Ahmad Ahmed Mu\u2019azu.\n\nMu\u2019azu happens to be the son of a former governor of the state and national chairman of the party, Ahmed Adamu Mu\u2019azu, who himself is a longtime rival of Governor Bala Mohammed. Kashim, on the other hand, is the present secretary to the Bauchi government.\n\nThough no public announcement has been made of his resignation, party officials have described him as a former SSG.\n\nBoth aspirants have obtained the PDP nomination and expression of interest forms for the 2023 governorship election in the state.\n\nAlhaji Yanyanuwa Zainabari, publicity secretary of the Bauchi State PDP, who confirmed the candidacy of Kashim to LEADERSHIP Sunday, however, dismissed that of Ahmed Mu\u2019azu.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThus far, the PDP in Bauchi State knows about the governorship aspiration of the former SSG of Bauchi State, Barrister Ibrahim Kashim. He has obtained all the necessary forms.\n\n\u201cI cannot say anything about the son of Ahmed Mu\u2019azu because at the state level of the party, we don\u2019t have a record that can validate his governorship candidacy under our great party.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a list of all the aspirants for various positions in the state, but I can assure you that the name of Mu\u2019azu\u2019s son is not on the list.\n\n\u201cIn this era of social media, he can circulate anything to suit his bias but that can never be official with the party in Bauchi,\u201d Zainabari said.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday findings revealed that that Mu\u2019azu may not have clearance from the Bauchi State secretariat of the PDP to go for the governorship ticket of the party, but it is not clear whether he is just being denied the clearance or he has not sought for it.\n\nEfforts aimed at discrediting the candidacy of Adamu Mu\u2019azu\u2019s son, it was however learnt, might not be unconnected with the overwhelming control Governor Mohammed exerts on the structure of the PDP in Bauchi.\n\nMany political analysts in Bauchi consider Barrister Kashim to be the proxy representation of the state governor whose attention has been overtaken by his interest to clinch the PDP presidential ticket in 2023.\n\nWhile receiving the report of his presidential contact committee on January 28 this year, Governor Mohammed said he was going to deploy the model Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, deployed to regain his governorship ticket if he fails in his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cOne of my brothers, a formidable and astute politician, Matawalle Sokoto (Aminu Tambuwal) did it before. So we are going to also test it,\u201d he said.\n\nA PDP member in Bauchi who did not want to be identified said it was clear that Mu\u2019azu wants to use his son to settle old scores with Governor Mohammed.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut he is supposed to know that he is too big for such dirty politics play. While Mu\u2019azu has relevance in national politics in Nigeria, at the moment, he cannot do and undo anything in PDP in Bauchi State and this will not help the governorship candidacy of his son.\n\n\u201cThey may want to reclaim the ticket after the party\u2019s primaries on the argument that his son did not contest primaries with Bala Mohammed. And normally when there is any change of candidate, the one that comes second naturally replaces the initial winner.\n\n\u201cDo you know whether the party will even screen out the younger Mu\u2019azu before the time for the party\u2019s primaries?\n\n\u201cIt is understandable that the SSG does not have the wherewithal to contest for the governorship seat in Bauchi. He is just a candidate of the governor and Governor Bala will replace him if he does not get PDP\u2019s presidential ticket before the official list of candidates is submitted to INEC\u201d.\n\nLast week, pictures of Ahmad Ahmed Mu\u2019azu with former President Goodluck Jonathan and his governorship form circulated on the social media space in Bauchi.\n\nHis loyalists claimed that he went to get the fatherly blessing of the former president in his quest to contest the Bauchi governorship seat.\n\nJust like the Rivers West and Rivers South-East senatorial districts, the PDP gave out only one expression of interest and intent form for the Rivers East, the senatorial district of Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike.\n\nAlthough other PDP stalwarts, including a former member of the House of Representatives, Ogbonna Nwuke, is eying the Rivers East senatorial seat, the only form was sold to former commissioner for Sports, Hon Allwell Onyesoh.\n\nThe current Senator representing the district, Senator George Thompson Sekibo, has indicated that he would not return to the Red Chamber for another term.\n\nSekibo is among the over 15 PDP stalwarts that have already picked forms to contest the 2023 governorship election.\n\nAs the race for various elective political offices thickens, the contest for PDP Sokoto South senatorial district seems to have been settled.\n\nAs the opportunity for the purchase of the party\u2019s nomination forms for various offices closes, only one aspirant purchased the nomination forms for the senatorial seat, with the incumbent, Senator, Ibrahim Abdullahi Danbaba, not re-contesting for the seat.\n\nSenator Danbaba, currently representing the southern senatorial zone, has decided to move ahead and is among the four aspirants contesting for the Sokoto State PDP governorship ticket.\n\nOthers in contest for the PDP governorship ticket are Sagir Bafarawa; former minister, Muktar Shagari and incumbent deputy governor, Manir Dan\u2019Iya.\n\nAt present, the PDP\u2019s sole candidate is Bala Bodinga, a former member of the Sokoto State House of Assembly and lately, commissioner for Land and Housing.\n\nA source who preferred anonymity hinted our correspondent that the candidature of Bodinga for the Senate seat is nothing but a smokescreen.\n\nThis however could not be ascertained, as party sources contacted declined comment on this.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cHonourable Bala Bodinga is only holding the ticket in trust for Governor Tambuwal who is likely to fly the ticket. And for Governor Tambuwal, this is his stock in trade \u2013 the masterstroke he deployed in 2019.\n\n\u201cYou would recall that while Governor Tambuwal contested for the 2019 PDP presidential ticket, the incumbent deputy governor, Manir Dan Iya, held the governorship ticket in trust for him.\n\nWhen the governor failed to win the presidential ticket, he returned home to fly the governorship flag for his second tenure. The same scenario is potentially playing out, as 2023 elections draw nearer. This time around, Tambuwal\u2019s target is the Senate,\u201d the source stated.\n\nMeanwhile, as the 2023 general election draws closer and different political parties and aspirants continue to embark on consultations and purchase of nomination forms, the Ebonyi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) seems to be taking its time to understudy the zoning formula of the different wards, local governments and senatorial districts to avoid agitation that may arise after the primaries.\n\nIt would be recalled that the party had about a month ago set up a zoning committee headed by the immediate younger brother of the state governor, Chief Austin Umahi.\n\nThe committee is saddled with the responsibility of visiting the different communities, wards, local government areas and senatorial districts to discuss with stakeholders on the zoning arrangements of the different areas where it exists and come out with recommendations on how best to conduct the primaries and bring out candidates based on the zoning arrangements.\n\nIn Ebonyi South senatorial zone where the State governor, David Umahi, comes from, no one has declared intention to contest the senatorial seat under the platform of the APC.\n\nThe decision not to declare their intention may not be unconnected to the responsibility given to the committee on zoning.\n\nThe committee on Thursday, April 14, held a meeting with stakeholders of the senatorial zone at the council headquarters of Afikpo North local government area.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, there were speculations that the committee had concluded plans to zone the senatorial position to Uburu in Ohaozara local government area of the state, the hometown of the state governor.\n\nIt would be recalled that a few days ago, the social media was awash with speculations that Governor Umahi has dropped his presidential ambition to contest the Ebonyi South senatorial seat.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the state commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Orji Uchenna Orji, and the chairman Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), Princess Nkechinyere Iyioku, debunked the allegation, saying the presidential ambition of the state governor was still intact and unshakable.\n\nA member of the zoning committee who did not want his name in print spurned an allegation that the committee after its meeting on Thursday, zoned the senatorial position to Uburu in Ohaozara local government.\n\nThe source maintained that the committee would complete its assignment on Tuesday and submit its recommendation to the party.",

          "text": "Civil society organisations (CSOs) in the country have expressed dismay over the pardon granted to some former governors of Plateau and Taraba States, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame, as well as other politicians convicted by the courts for corruption.\n\nThe council of state chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the pardon of 159 convicts, including Senator Dariye and Nyame who were both imprisoned for looting N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion respectively.\n\nBut criticizing the state pardon, the CSOs said they are worried about the effect such ill-thought political pardon would have on the anti-corruption efforts, which constitutes the major agenda and commitment of the current administration.\n\nThe Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Transparency International (TI) Nigeria said they find some of the names recommended by the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy which is headed by minister of Justice and attorney-general of the federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, questionable.\n\nAccording to them, the mere fact that citizens cannot get the full list of the over 150 persons pardoned shows a lack of transparency in the process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement signed by their leader, Awwal Musa Rafsanjani, noted: \u201cThis trend of shielding Politically Exposed Persons from accounting for their actions is disturbing. Recall that in 2019, the Ministry of Justice filed a nolle prosequi to strike out high profile cases. An example of this was that of Senator Danjuma Goje alongside a former Executive Chairman of Gombe State Universal Basic Education Board, Mr. Aliyu El-Nafaty in 2019.\n\n\u201cCoupled with corruption allegation in the judicial system, this pardon shows how bad Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption efforts is and it comes barely a week after the United States government released it\u2019s \u20182021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Nigeria\u2019 where it accused Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of focusing on low-and mid level government officials.\n\n\u201cThe pardon further confirms the poor rating of Nigeria on different global indexes and reports like the Corruption Perception Index and the Afro barometer corruption survey which have reported an increase in corruption in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, the official pardon basically targeted at political settlement is indeed a major setback to our nation\u2019s progress and achievements in the fight against corruption, while validating public perception of the administration\u2019s reported disproportionate and lop-sided fight against corruption in the country.\n\n\u201cThis move goes further to demoralize our anti-corruption agencies who are already facing challenges prosecuting high profile cases of corruption. Some of these cases took over ten years to conclude and with lots of resources committed,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe CSOs further said when convicted individuals who looted billions of naira are released there is no way the international community would take Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption efforts seriously, especially when attempts are being made to recover stolen assets outside the country.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the processes and objectives of such Presidential pardon will be re-examined and made transparent to avoid bad precedence, especially as the nation moves towards political transition in the 2023 general elections,\u201d they added.\n\nOther CSOs who condemned the pardon of politicians serving jail terms are Yiaga Africa; International Press Centre (IPC); Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD); The Albino Foundation; CLEEN Foundation; Institute for Media and Society (IMS) and Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF).\n\nOthers include Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ); Partners for Electoral Reform (PER); Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC); Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and Nigerian Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (NNNGO).\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP yesterday, the spokesman for the CSOs and the executive director for Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, said the action will affect the fight against corruption in the country.",

          "text": "By IGHO OYOYO, Abuja\n\nCatholic Bishops of Nigeria under the auspices of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) and Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade have urged Christians to imbibe the virtues of Jesus Christ and adopt them as a template for everyday living.\n\nIn an Easter message signed by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, the governor stressed that Christ\u2019s death on the cross for the redemption of mankind and His resurrection after three days signify unwavering love, compassion, sacrifice, selflessness and triumph over despair.\n\nAyade maintained that it was only through show of love and compassion for one another and for Nigeria and sacrifice and selflessness that Nigerians can navigate through the present difficult times.\n\nAlso, ahead of the 2023 general elections, Catholic Bishops of Nigeria under the auspices of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) have called on politicians to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship and not to see a political contest as a do-or-die affair in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nMost Reverend Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji, President of CBCN and Archbishop-Elect of Owerri Apostolic Administrator of Umuahia, who made this call yesterday in an Easter message on behalf of the Bishops, said that as Nigerians draw closer to another period of general elections, which are often characterised by bloody conflicts, everyone must make a personal commitment to non-violence.\n\nHe said that this is because violence only breeds violence, that the vicious cycle of violence results in utter destruction and is never a solution to any human problem.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, far from fighting and killing one another as a way of settling differences, we should hearken to those beautiful words of Isaiah: \u201cBeat your sword into ploughshares\u201d (Is 2, 4).

          "title": "Kukah bombs Buhari: Your govt has slid into hibernation mode, divided Nigeria",
          "text": "Bishop Matthew Kukah, Diocese of Sokoto, has attacked President Muhammadu Buhari again, saying his government has slid into hibernation mode and polarised Nigeria into ethnic and religious line.\n\nKukah, in his Easter Message on Sunday lamented that Nigeria still tottered and wobbled as the nation screeched towards a dangerous and avoidable canyon of dry bones.\n\nHe said Nigeria could no longer recognise their country which had been battered and buffeted by men and women from the dark womb of time.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is how to find the slippery rungs on the ladder of ascent so we can climb out. Yet, we ask, ascend to where? For us as Christians, ascent is to the loving embrace of the resurrected Christ who is Lord of history.\n\n\u201cThe government has slid into hibernation mode. It is hard to know whether the problem is that those in power do not hear, see, feel, know, or just don\u2019t care. Either way, from this crossroad, we must make a choice, to go forward, turn left or right or return home. None of these choices are easy, yet, guided by the light of the risen Christ, we can reclaim our country from its impending slide to anarchy,\u201d he stated.\n\nKukah said the greatest challenge now is how to begin a process of reconstructing the nation hoping that it could hang on and survive the 2023 elections, adding that the real challenge before the nation now was to look beyond politics and face the challenge of forming character and faith in our country.\n\nHe added that leaders of religion, Christianity and Islam, needed to truthfully face the role of religion in the survival of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the greatest challenge for Nigeria was not even the 2023 elections, but the prospects for the reconciliation of the people.\n\n\u201cHere, the Buhari administration sadly has divided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history. This carefully choreographed agenda has made Nigerians vulnerable and ignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among our people.\n\n\u201cYears of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping. Notwithstanding these challenges, religious leaders must recover and deploy their moral authority and avoid falling victim to the schemes of politicians and their material enticements.\n\n\u201cToday, the values of Interfaith dialogue have come under severe strain and pressure with extremists from both sides of our faiths denigrating the idea of dialogue with their counterparts of other faiths. Ignorance and miseducation have combined with prejudice to create the falsehood that somehow, one religion is superior to the others. With so many ill equipped fraudsters posing as religious leaders, there is an obsession with defaming the others and widening our differences.\n\n\u201cReligious leaders must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam. While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful who are marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts,\u201d he added.\n\nKukah said there was the need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that had engulfed the communities and nation.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name. The way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural Democracy.\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\n\n\u201cIn finding our way forward, the President must concede that it is within his powers to decide how we are going to end the war that has engulfed and is tearing down our nation. It seems that the federal government has shown far greater commitment to integrating so called repentant terrorists than getting our children back from kidnappers or keeping our universities open.\n\n\u201cEarlier last month, Operation Safe Corridor announced that it had graduated 599 members of various terrorist groups who have acquired new skills and are now ready to be integrated into society. The total comes to over a thousand now. It is plausible to note that the programme involves pyscho-social support, rehabilitation, vocational training, skill acquisition and start-ups.\n\n\u201cDespite all this, the larger issue is that their various communities have expressed their reluctance to receive their erring sons back. Nigerians have no access to the transcripts of the texts of the confessions of these terrorists not to talk of evidence of their commitment to not sin again.\n\n\u201cWe have only the words of the terrorists and the same military that they have been fighting a war with. It speaks volumes when the President and his military hierarchy choose to believe these young men who took up arms and for years waged war against their country, killed, maimed and wasted thousands of lives, destroyed entire communities and now, they are being housed, fed, clothed with public funds. All this while their victims have been forced to make the various IDP camps their new homes! Where is the justice for the victims and the rest of the country they have destroyed?\u201d\n\nKukah argued that the challenge of fixing this broken nation was enormous and required joint efforts, adding that the 2023 beckoned and the stage is set.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is whether we have learnt any lessons from the tragedy that has afflicted us in the last few years. The Presidency of Nigeria is not a human right based on ethnic, religious or regional sentiments. The next President of Nigeria must be a man or woman with a heart, a sense of empathy and a soul on fire that can set limits to what human indignities visited on citizens that he or she can tolerate.\n\n\u201cWe have no need for any further empty messianic rhetoric laced with deceitful and grandiose religiosity. We need someone who can fix our broken nation, rid our people of the looming dangers of hunger and destitution. Our Presidential aspirants must show evidence from their legacies and antecedents that they know the country well enough and its severe wounds.\n\n\u201cWhoever wants to govern us must illustrate that he or she understands what has turned our nation into a national hospital and show us plans for our discharge from this horror. Support for INEC and its infrastructure is fundamental to a free and fair election and we condemn in very strong terms all those criminals who continue to threaten the society with violence. They should meet the full force of the law,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "SERAP to Buhari: Withdraw pardon for Dariye, Nyame now",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently review and withdraw the pardon granted to former governors of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye, and Taraba State, Rev Jolly Nyame who are serving jail terms for corruption.\n\nSERAP is also urging him to propose constitutional amendment to the National Assembly to reform the provisions on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy to make the provisions more transparent, and consistent and compatible with Nigeria\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations.\n\nMr Dariye and Mr Nyame were jailed for stealing N1.16bn and N1.6bn, respectively. However, the National Council of State last week endorsed the pardon of Mr Dariye, Mr Nyame and 157 others serving jail terms following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.\n\nIn the letter dated 16 April, 2022 and signed by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cImpunity for corruption will continue as long as influential politicians escape justice for their crimes. The constitutional power of prerogative of mercy ought not to be an instrument of impunity.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cThe pardon power ought to be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], particularly the provisions on oath of office by public officers, and section 15[5] which requires your government to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSERAP also said, \u201cIndeed, the presidential pardon power must be exercised in good faith, and in line with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution on fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cWe would like your government to clarify if the pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame would entitle them to the return of the stolen assets already forfeited to the government.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cThe pardon also constitutes an interference in the exercise of judicial power. Because the pardon appears to be arbitrary, it undermines the authority and independence of the judiciary, and access to justice for victims of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe letter, copied to the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, read in part: \u201cThe pardon is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution, and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption.\n\n\u201cPresidential pardon for corruption cases is inconsistent with the rule of law, and the public interest, as it undermines the principle of equality before the law. It will undermine public confidence in your government\u2019s fight against corruption, and the justice system.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that while the pardon power is routinely exercised to shield influential politicians and politically exposed persons from justice and accountability, ordinary people who have committed petty offences but with no money or influential politicians to speak for them, languish in prisons and are rarely considered for pardon.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no doubt that Section 175 of the Constitution vests wide discretionary power in the Nigerian president to grant pardon, it does not stipulate the conditions under which such power should be exercised.\n\n\u201cHowever, when section 15(5) of the Constitution is read together with the oath, it would seem to impose some ethical conditions on you to ensure that the exercise of the discretionary power of prerogative of mercy is not such that it will encourage corruption or impunity of perpetrators.\n\n\u201cMr Dariye and Mr Nyame should have been allowed to complete their jail terms. The exercise of the presidential pardon in their cases would seem to be unfair and undeserving.\n\n\u201cThe investigation and prosecution of the corruption cases involving the pardoned former governors Dariye and Nyame reportedly cost over N300 millions of taxpayers\u2019 money. The cases went from the High Court to the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSection 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018The State shall abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u2019 Similarly, article 26 of the UN Convention against Corruption requires your government to ensure \u2018effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions\u2019 in cases of grand corruption.\n\n\u201cArticle 26 of the convention complements the more general requirement of article 30, paragraph 1, that sanctions must take into account the gravity of the corruption offences.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that in your inaugural speech on May 29, 2015 you stated that, \u2018We are going to tackle pervasive corruption head on. Nigerians will not regret that they have entrusted national responsibility to us.\u2019\n\n\u201cHowever, the latest Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index shows that Nigeria scored 24 out of 100 points, and ranked 154 out of 180 countries surveyed, falling back five places from the rank of 149 in 2020. This places Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe pardon power, if properly exercised, can help to protect citizens against possible miscarriage of justice.\n\n\u201cSERAP therefore urges you to urgently withdraw the presidential pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame, and to propose amendment to section 175 of the Nigerian Constitution that will make the exercise of the power to pardon more transparent and consistent and compatible with the country\u2019s international obligations.\n\n\u201cAny proposed amendment should also empower the citizens to challenge the legality of any arbitrary exercise of the power of prerogative of mercy.\u201d",

Under Section 17 of the 1999 Constitution, there shall be equality and equal rights for all citizens.\n\n\u201cSection 42 of the Constitution says there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class and gender, so you cannot take out a few people on the basis that they belong to a category or section of the society.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that if the government did not release others, I am going to call on lawyers whose clients are left in custody to come to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment on their clients.\n\n\u201cJust two weeks ago, a Nigerian was jailed for stealing N1,000 in Abuja; the accused pleaded with the judge that he had no food but the judge jailed him for six months.\n\n\u201cWhen we are talking of justice and fair play, if you want to pardon some set of people, then you must also extend presidential pardon to petty thieves in the prisons.\n\n\u201cThis is because if the big thieves are being asked to go, then they must also extend the facility to other Nigerians,\u201d the rights crusader said.\n\nSpeaking on the passing of late Odumakin after a year, Falana described his loss as a monumental tragedy.\n\n\u201cYinka remained a symbol of justice and we are gathered to celebrate his legacy. He was a man of honour, hope and consistency; a man who gave hope to the masses,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Ibikunle Amosun said the deceased was a friend who built bridges across ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\u201cHis legacy will still remain and the memory of his demise still lingers. My heart goes to his widow, Joe for staying strong after his demise,\u201d the former Ogun governor said.\n\nSimilarly, Tunde Bakare, the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church and a presidential hopeful, said late Odumakin was a fearless person who did not labour in vain, adding that his memory would linger forever.\n\nAlso, Akinwunmi Adesina, president, African Development Bank, said Mr Odumakin was a respected rights activist and a democrat.\n\nLeader of Oodua People\u2019s Congress, OPC, Gani Adams, thanked Mr Odumakin\u2019s widow for erecting a legacy for the deceased.\n\nHe noted that the Foundation would give room for generations to learn about what the deceased fought about.\n\nIn her remarks, the widow, Joe Okei-Odumakin, said her husband devoted to true federalism.\n\nShe described her deceased husband as an encyclopaedia of positive activism.\n\nNAN reports that late Odumakin, died in April 2, 2021, after battling with respiratory problems, occasioned by COVID-19 complications.",

Unfortunately, this is hardly the case for majority of people, especially those working in Africa.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the reverse is actually the case, as millions of people across the continent earn what can best be described as \u201cpoverty pay\u201d.\n\nIndeed, African countries have some of the lowest minimum wage rates in the world with Nigeria not ranking among the first 20. Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage is N30, 000 (equivalent of 51 USD).\n\nThe highest paying minimum wage Afrixan country is Seychelles m minimum wage at $432 per month.\n\nPerhaps this shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. After all, some of the world\u2019s poorest countries are located here. But this notwithstanding, workers in some African countries stand better chance of earning more than others.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, a minimum wage is the lowest, statutorily required wage that a worker can earn. In other words, it is illegal for employers to pay employees anything short of the minimum wage as stipulated by a federal law of a given country.\n\nBelow are the African countries with the highest minimum wage, according to available statistics obtained from Statista.

It\u2019s hard to describe it, you have to feel it.\u201d\n\nUnderground Hideout\n\nDeep underground, the metro stations of Kharkiv are now home to residents of the eastern metropolis fearful of the battle raging above.\n\nSince pulling back from its northern offensive to capture the capital of Kyiv, the Kremlin has scaled up attacks on Ukraine\u2019s eastern flank, including Kharkiv just 21 kilometres (13 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nOn Friday, shelling of residential areas of the city killed 10 people. On Saturday, a strike claimed two more lives.\n\nThe walkways of the metro stations are now lined with bedding and mounds of belongings.

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Gov Yahaya Bello is APC\u2019s best bet",
          "text": "The Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation says the governor Yahaya Bello possesses all the attributes that can retain the presidency for the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2023.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, added that the well experienced and accomplished leaders of the party would not sacrifice Bello\u2019s winning attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics.\n\nShe said this in a statement she signed and made available to journalists on Friday.\n\nAccording to her, the party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult.\n\nHighlighting the attributes that distinguished Governor Bello as the candidate to beat, the media directorate said aside from Bello\u2019s plethora of obvious achievements in Kogi State, he enjoyed the massive support of Nigerian women and youths, which must not be ignored, considering their numerical strength.\n\nHis uncommon loyalty to the President, his colleagues, and allies, among others, as well as his clean records as regards the issue of betrayal of any form, among others, were some of the attributes listed in his favour.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe stage is almost set for Nigerians to, once again, choose the leaders that will steer the affairs of the nation at all levels for another four years. But before the general elections, the struggle is within the parties, and in that regard, many have put their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race in the ruling All Progressives Congress is populated by known heavyweights in Nigeria\u2019s politics, and in the next few weeks, depending on what the party decides, all aspirants that have had the courage to declare so far and those still preparing to do so, would have to jostle for just one ticket.\n\n\u201cSome groups have even almost concluded that this ticket belongs to a particular zone as a result of some prior unwritten agreement, but those who have the interest of the nation at heart have said, times without number, that there is no zoning in the constitution of the party, and more importantly, that the best must get the job, regardless of his zone, if the wellbeing of the country is the target.\n\n\u201cOn the 2nd of April 2022, His Excellency, Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, formally declared to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 under the platform of the APC. In his signature bold manner, the declaration ceremony at the Eagle Square, Abuja, has been described, even by unrelenting critics as the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis was even more significant because, while others veiled their declaration under other programmes, others, afraid to test their popularity the way of Governor Bello, settled for video recordings of their declaration speeches.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed commendable that despite the fears that there would be an irreversible crack in the APC after the last Convention, the party, under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, proved naysayers wrong and had a rancour-free exercise, which has produced leaders of note to man the different offices in the party.\n\n\u201cThe party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult for incumbents. There are, however, many reasons the choice of Yahaya Bello would make the journey easier for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe party needs a candidate that can connect massively with women and youths, considering their combined numerical strength and that candidate is no other than Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cThe preference of Nigerians, regardless of tribe, religion or party affiliation, for a younger leader is also very clear. Of the pool of aspirants, as the country stands today, even across party lines, Governor Yahaya Bello is the best bet for the younger generation if this dream must be actualized.\n\n\u201cThis consideration has made millions of youths across Nigeria resolve to put their numbers behind the Governor, and this is verifiable with the number of active youths with PVCs currently on the Bello Ambassadors Network, Rescue Nigeria Mission, and Yahaya Bello Network, among many other support groups.\n\n\u201cAgain, the North-Central, where Governor Bello comes from, has not produced a democratically elected president in the history of Nigeria, and so, irrespective of what people are made to believe, they will support their own when it is time to take a stand. The North Central believes strongly that the time for them to occupy the Aso Rock Villa is now. Being the strongest contender from the region places Governor Bello in a vantage position to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is an acclaimed unifier. It is a well known fact that, for the first time in the history of Kogi State, the sharp, bitter division between the three major ethnic groups gave way to unity and harmony under the Governor. He united the tribes, starting from his cabinet, and today, everyone is first a Kogi indigene before being identified with his ethnic group. Nigeria needs a unifier now more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is ever ready to build on the President\u2019s efforts in this regard. How he turned the state from a notorious state, where kidnappers and criminals built empires, to one of the safest in Nigeria today and, conveniently, the safest in the north, is a question that has been on the lips of many Nigerians. Therefore, in terms of the main issues confronting the nation, Governor Yahaya Bello has excelled remarkably in Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe loyalty of Governor Bello to the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari, has often been described by critics as \u201cannoying\u201d, but this is the stuff our aspirant is made of. He is loyal to his friends, colleagues and allies, and more so, to the APC. He has demonstrated this on so many occasions, even in very difficult situations. He has no record of betrayal to his party members and his principles. He is a fair game player.\n\n\u201cThe current well experienced and accomplished party leaders would definitely not sacrifice these laudable attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics. They will rally round Governor Yahaya Bello and retain the presidency with a wide margin come 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "Russia Sets Deadline for Ukraine Troops in Mariupol to Surrender",
          "text": "Russia told Ukrainian forces fighting in Mariupol to lay down arms on Sunday morning to save their lives, but there were no immediate reports of activity three hours after the ultimatum took effect at 0300 GMT in the strategic southeastern port.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded across the country early in the day, a regular occurrence, and a morning report from the Ukrainian military said Russian air strikes on Mariupol continued while there were \u201cassault operations near the seaport.\u201d\n\nLocal media reported an explosion in the capital Kyiv but Mykola Povoroznyk, the city\u2019s deputy mayor, said there were no explosions and air defence systems had prevented Russian attacks.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained in a giant steelworks on Saturday.\n\nMoscow\u2019s claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol, scene of the war\u2019s heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the catastrophic situation that has developed at the Azovstal metallurgical plant, as well as being guided by purely humane principles, the Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,\u201d the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,\u201d it said, adding that the defenders could leave the plant by 10 a.m. without arms or ammunition.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Kyiv.\n\nThe Azovstal plant, described as a fortress in a city, lies in an industrial area that looks out to the Sea of Azov and covers more than 11 square km (4 square miles), containing myriad buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks.\n\nThe city\u2019s defenders include Ukrainian marines, motorised brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard. It was not immediately known how many were in the steelworks.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very difficult\u201d in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal. \u201cOur soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis\u2026 Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences.\n\nThe western city, relatively unscathed so far, has served as a haven for refugees and international aid agencies.\n\nTWISTED STEEL, BLASTED CONCRETE\n\nIn Mariupol, Reuters journalists reached the giant Illich steelworks, one of two metals plants where defenders had held out in underground tunnels and bunkers. Moscow claimed to have captured it on Friday.\n\nThe factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops had \u201ccompletely cleared\u201d Mariupol\u2019s urban area of Ukrainian forces and blockaded the \u201cremnants\u201d in the Azovstal steelworks, RIA news agency said. It said that as of Saturday, Ukrainian forces in the city had lost more than 4,000 personnel.\n\nZelenskiy accused Russia of \u201cdeliberately trying to destroy everyone\u201d in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. He did not address Moscow\u2019s claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.\n\nHe said also that \u201cextermination\u201d of the fighters in Mariupol would put an end to any form of negotiations with Russia.\n\nRussia had said on Friday it would intensify long-range strikes in retaliation for unspecified acts of \u201csabotage\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d, hours after it confirmed the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva.\n\nKyiv and Washington say the ship, whose sinking has become a symbol of Ukrainian defiance, was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow says it sank after a fire and its crew of around 500 were evacuated.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry published video of the head of the navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting on a parade ground with about a hundred sailors it said were members of the crew.\n\nRUSSIA\u2019S BIGGEST PRIZE\n\nIf Mariupol falls it would be Russia\u2019s biggest prize of the war so far. It is the main port of the Donbas, a region of two provinces in the southeast which Moscow demands be fully ceded to separatists.\n\nUkraine says it has so far held off Russian advances elsewhere in the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where at least one person was killed in shelling overnight. read more\n\nUkraine gained the upper hand in the early phase of a war, in part by successfully deploying mobile units armed with anti-tank missiles supplied by the West against Russian armoured convoys confined to roads by muddy terrain.\n\nBut Putin appears determined to capture more Donbas territory to claim victory in a war that has left Russia subject to increasingly punitive Western sanctions and with few allies.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s forthcoming round of sanctions on Russia will target banks, including Sberbank (SBER.MM), as well as oil, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.",

          "title": "Pardon All Thieves in Prison, SANs Tell Buhari, Knock President Over Dariye, Nyame",
          "text": "Three Senior Advocates of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome, Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Jibrin Okutepa, have faulted the state pardon granted to former Governors Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to pardon other thieves in prison.\n\nThe former governors, who were jailed for corruption, were pardoned alongside 157 others at the Council of State meeting presided over by President Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe action by the government, has however come under strong criticisms by many Nigerians, including Ozekhome.\n\nOzekhome, in faulting the action of the president queried the basis for granting the pardon when the charge of corruption upon which they were convicted is not only a bane in the country but \u201cstruts around imperiously like a peacock\u201d.\n\nIn a statement titled: \u2018Legal and Moral Implications of Granting Pardon to Ex-convicts and Serving Prisoners,\u2019 the senior lawyer was of the opinion that the decision to free the two governors who are still serving their jail terms was not in the interest of the people and capable of dampening the confidence of the citizenry in the national moral fabric, and in the fight against corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy granting pardon to these treasury looters, Buhari is reviving, nurturing and watering corruption with state powers\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, when the Council of State recently authorised the pardon of 159 convicts, including Senator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and ex-Governor Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were both imprisoned for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, many Nigerians justifiably showed anger, because these two political leaders had been duly tried and convicted for stealing money belonging to their respective states\u201d, he said.\n\nThe senior lawyer maintained that the purpose of criminal prosecution is to secure justice, not only for the accused, but also for the victims of crimes and the state; and to some extent get reparation and restitution for the victims, while deterring others from going the same route.\n\n\u201cWhere lies the justice for the impoverished people of Plateau and Taraba States who will now watch their tormentors stroll out with red carpet treatment?\n\n\u201cThe government budgets huge sums of money for the prosecution of such accused persons from the tax players\u2019 sweat; and if after the rigorous period of trial and subsequent conviction, the guilty are simply let off the hook in such a brazen manner, the little remaining lean hope the citizens have in the system is further diminished\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile stating that both the president and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges, Ozekhome explained that a constitutional issue as volatile as this could have been better managed if the minders of the president had told him the embarrassment this could cause the government in the estimation of the comity of nations.\n\nSimilarly, Falana, speaking during the one year remembrance programme for the late Publicity Secretary of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Yinka Odumakin, described the release of the former governors as discriminatory.\n\nHe stressed that it was wrong to grant state pardon to the two of them who were convicted for stealing state funds.\n\nFalana said under the 1999 constitution, there is equality for all citizens, adding that the state pardon has to be extended to all thieves and criminals serving jail terms in various prisons.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy reaction is that all criminals, all thieves and criminals in our prisons should be released.\n\n\u201cBecause Section 17 of the Constitution says there shall be equality, equal rights for all citizens and section 42 said there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class, gender, whatever, so you can\u2019t take out two people and leave the rest there. It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said he might be forced to ask lawyers whose clients are still in prison to go to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment.\n\nFalana suggested that the 1999 constitution should be referred to as decree 24 of 1999 as \u201cit was not duly signed.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat the National Assembly has continued to do is to amend illegality. The so-called 1999 constitution is really decree 24 of 1999. When you see the so-called constitution, you will not see the signature of the man who signed the law, that\u2019s the fraud.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a law, the name of the person who signed it should be there with the date.\n\n\u201cDecree 24 of 1999 was promulgated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar on the 5th of May 1999 but today you will not see his name on it. It\u2019s a fraudulent document.\n\n\u201cThe decree was imposed on us by the last set of military dictators in Nigeria headed by Gen. Abubakar and because that document is okay for members of the ruling class regardless of their political parties, ethnic, regional or religious inclination, they are all comfortable with the document so they can\u2019t do anything about it including all those we are campaigning today to be President.\n\n\u201cIt is to retain the status quo and perhaps adjust it here and there, that is the only thing they are saying, so those who are contesting particularly on the platform of the ruling party are saying we are going to continue the programme of the Buhari administration that has put our country in problem.\n\n\u201cNigeria has become a huge joke in the committee of nations and so for any set of people to say they want to package his rickety vehicle and begin to panel beat it, it\u2019s not going to move.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okutepa faulted the presidential pardon granted to Dariye and Nyame.\n\nHe wondered why president Buhari granted the pardon despite his lamentations that corruption is affecting Nigeria\u2019s growth.\n\nWhile speaking during an interview, he said: \u201cWe are all aware of the reasons they were arraigned and found guilty by the Supreme Court. They are politically exposed people in our society.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things that has retarded the growth of Nigeria today is corruption. It is the best enterprise in Nigeria today. So, when I heard that Buhari agreed to pardon the ex-governors, I weep for this country. The reason is that the mantra for which this person came to power is that of corruption.\n\n\u201cThe duty of the Nigerian government is to fight and eradicate corruption. Corruption has become so cancerous and all hands must be on deck to fight it. I am so upset by the decision because the ex-governor of Plateau State has his appeal dismissed in March 2021 by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIn this country, the executive had on a series of occasions said that one of the things affecting the fight against corruption is the judiciary, so if the judiciary, therefore, enforces the provisions of the law and sends the ex-governors to prison, why does the executive sabotage its own law.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "As the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) entered its 61st day on Saturday, the federal government\u2019s move to renegotiate a deal reached with the university lecturers has witnessed a setback.\n\nThis followed the insistence by ASUU that the government should first pay the accrued N200 billion revitalisation fund for revamping the dilapidated infrastructure in the various institutions before it calls off the strike or engage in further negotiations.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed that it had set up a renegotiation committee to dialogue further with the lecturers to amend the earliest proposals in line with current economic realities.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who stated the government\u2019s position at a recent function in Abuja, said the renegotiation of conditions of service of the university lecturers, must be guided by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principle of ability to pay.\n\nNgige said the former renegotiation committee headed by Prof. Jubril Munzali proposed a 200 per cent rise in the emoluments of university workers, which the federal government cannot pay.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on the telephone on Saturday, the President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, argued that the May 2021 agreement is still sacrosanct and should be implemented for sanity to return to the tertiary institutions.\n\nWhen asked whether anything has been done to address their demands, Osodeke said: \u201cNo progress yet. It is still the same thing.\u201d\n\nReacting to the statement by the federal government that it had set up a renegotiating team led by Prof. Nimi Briggs to meet with ASUU on its demands, Osodeke said: \u201cWe have finished negotiations and we are expecting them to either sign it and implement or reject it but they have not done anything.\u201d\n\nWhen THISDAY drew his attention to the statement made by Ngige that the federal government could not sign the proposal because it has no money to implement, Osodeke said: \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the money, they will find. We will not renegotiate it. Why will they say that they don\u2019t have the money when they can have N4 trillion to fund fuel subsidies and you don\u2019t have N200 billion for your universities. Does it make any sense?\n\n\u201cIf they can raise N4 trillion to give to some people in the name of so-called fuel subsidy and then you cannot raise N200 billion to stop the strike and get our children back to school, does it make sense to anybody? So it is just setting the priorities right. Why not take N200 billion out of the N4 trillion fuel subsidy money and end this strike?\u201d he queried.\n\nOsodeke however said that the most critical issue is the payment of the revitalisation fund and the salary of the lecturers.\n\n\u201cAs we speak now, a professor in the country goes home monthly with only $600 while a senator goes home monthly with almost N18 million. How do you justify that? How will the $600 feed the professor and still be able to take care of his research work?\u201d he asked.\n\nSpeaking on the negotiations for improved salary for university staff, the ASUU president said that the government was yet to come up with any proposal on that.\n\nAccording to him, ASUU met last week with the federal government\u2019s renegotiation team but the government failed to come up with any proposal.\n\n\u201cSo, we are still waiting for them to bring their proposal of the conditions of salaries of lecturers,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen also asked if ASUU\u2019s position on salary increase, Osodeke insisted that the union concluded negotiations and a figure already agreed on with the government in May 2021.\n\n\u201cSo, we are not looking for any other one, we already have that one but they did not agree, they should come up with the one they have. Will it take one year to do that?\u201d\n\nWhile tracing the origin of the dispute on revitalisation fund, Osodeke said it was a panel set up by the government that recommended that it should invest N1.3 trillion in Nigerian universities to revamp it to the expected standards.\n\nHe said that based on the recommendations, the Jonathan-led administration had released N200 billion.\n\n\u201cSince that time, this government has only released N70 billion, when they were to release N200 billion every year. This is why our universities are lagging behind today and we don\u2019t have any foreign students or lecturers as before because the standard of our laboratories and equipment are not enough to attract anybody from other parts of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
