          "text": "FORMER Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said Nigerians were eagerly awaiting the return of the Peoples Democratic Party to power come 2023.\n\nHe said this in an interview with newsmen, in Port Harcourt, on Thursday.\n\nThe former PDP Presidential candidate in the 2019 elections spoke after a meeting with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, at his private residence earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by the Special Assistant to the Rivers State Governor on Media, Kelvin Ebiri.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Nigerians are waiting for PDP to take over power in 2023-Atiku.\u2019\n\nEbiri, quoted Atiku as telling newsmen at Government House, Port Harcourt, that the meeting with Wike was fruitful.\n\nAtiku was quoted as saying, \u201cWell, I came here to reconcile with the governor on party affairs and how we can ensure that there is unity and stability in the party.\n\n\u201cSo, that we can take over the government in 2023. I believe that Nigerians can\u2019t wait for 2023 to come, so that PDP will return.\u201d\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s security challenges, Atiku described the situation as dire.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have never seen it (insecurity) this bad. I am 70 years plus, I have never seen it this bad in terms of security challenges, in terms of economy, in terms of unemployment. This is the worst.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us time? We will come up with our policies. We will present them to Nigerians when the time comes. We have done that before. Under PDP, we recorded the highest economic growth, the best foreign reserves, we reduced unemployment. You know that we can do it.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nThe Abuja based church; Shiloh word chapel will be celebrating its 10th anniversary on July 30 and 31st, 2021. The church is known to be strong in the works of charity and giving; not only serves as a worship centre but also a transformational institution.\n\n.\n\nIn a media chat recently, the general overseer, Prophet Samuel (popularly known as I.O Samuel), joyously invites everyone to the event holding at Apo mechanic Village Abuja\n\n.\n\nSamuel, a strong follower and direct prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of TB Joshua, spoke extensively on the similarities he shares with the man in the synagogue, who recently passed on.\n\n.\n\nIn his word, he said\n\n\u201c\n\nJesus said \u201c I and my father are one (John 10.30). The Similarities of a Father and Son from the Same Country but Different Tribes can be clearly seen in the relationship between Prophet TB Joshua and Prophet I.O Samuel.\n\n.\n\nIf You Search This You Will Be Shocked. Look at these; If you look at my own picture and Snr Prophet TB Joshua At Age 30 Back To 55; And Prophet I O Samuel Todays Pictures, the Dressing, Preaching style, Video Clips Of Raw Healing crusades; raw deliverances accurate prophecies; national and global accuracy of prophecies yearly; with clear evidence and confirmation, royal kingly anointed grace to labour in the place of prayers; word of knowledge, planting ministries and meeting leaders, governors, presidents, ministers and kings, even to lay hands on them before they will even be announced openly.\n\n.\n\nThe same dimension of spiritual commands before Miracles and Deliverances happens.\n\nCharity, Selfless Services Like Excessive Humanitarian Activities; Not Minding The Faith, Race Or Color, crazy giving scholarship and real humble lifestyle, not materialistic or moved by any gifting; many Still argue this Man Is Not A biological Father To Prophet I O Samuel.\n\n.\n\nIn an interview session, many years back, I said, (talking about Jesus Christ) He Said Jesus and His disciples look-alike by the influence of the real followership, it is when you follow half-heartedly that you appear with differences in looks, conducts, results and most major activities.\n\n.\n\nFor example, Look at David Ibiyieomie And Bishop David OYEDEPO, what do you see?\n\nHe Claimed that Direct Communion With Christ cloned apostles; Even in acts they called them Christ-like not only in appearances but also in actions; No one will deny the impact in my life, many years before His exit I Mean My DADDY and Mentor Snr Prophet TB Joshua with evidence and appearance physical and spiritual mere looking at my own pictures or video clips people manifest or Receive answers to their needs even in dreams same with my fathers, black or white no differences! It is grace! Many have received healing and deliverance and breakthroughs just shaking hands with me, it is God, not me! Just when I get the lead to say or do as God commands, results follow.\n\n.\n\nthey have testimonies and victory it\u2019s only God that can do this.\n\n.\n\nThere is no glory that won\u2019t face resistance; I O Samuel was first criticized by Sahara reporter by his own family that saw him growing with grace before he was known globally. This was on the death of a well-known brother that was sick and died after autopsy they covered it up to date; many said his ministry will not last six months, but see what God has done, we are ten (10) years today.\n\nIn two months, God through me, gave a prophecy on BALA Nglari Becoming the Governor after impeachment; it came to pass!\n\n.\n\nNortherners, Government Officials; filled the church for thanksgiving; and I said that They will promote Val Ntom chukwu double your AIG, It came to pass, Crowd filled our church; Few weeks after Prince ATHUR EZEH and Governor Umahi Visited For Prayers. I said Go And Win And Stay 8Years ; We gave prophecy on Anambra state that Obiano Will Become Governor Twice; same thing for EDO state; Controversial election Came To Pass; Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s wife was sick I sent a small bottle of anointing water she was healed, and as a mark of show of God\u2019s faithfulness, she gave the church five hectares of land for a church in APO-Abuja to move from the top rank hotel,Utako- Abuja.\n\n.\n\nThe testimonies of God\u2019s faithfulness in our church are just too much.\n\nPresidential aspirants from Guinea Bissau Came, I told him you will work with the presidency. After elections, he was called to become a prime minister; said the cleric.\n\n.\n\nIt will also be recalled that He was the man that predicted the plane crash of OSIBANJO survival; Same with Coronavirus pandemic outbreak; he said everything with evidence on Live services on Facebook, one on one meetings and visits with Gods servants Snr Prophet TB Joshua was done by I O Samuel on uncountable times no matter the inconveniences here and there if you have been in SCOAN (Synagogue Church Of All Nation) you will know that is purely divine to be there once to be admitted not to talk of meeting with TB Joshua; it is not money but by God\u2019s grace;\n\n.\n\nHe continued \u201c I never gave up on my Impartation from DADDY monthly, I Was the only G.O that humbly went to prayer line monthly to contact grace, I am a biological son of a prophet; born a prophet, raised a prophet and served a prophet; after attending 2001 WOFBI of living Church Winners Chapel, Papa David OYEDEPO laid hands on me Spoke A Word To Me Go and duplicate what you see here, 2010 November Sons of Prophet Meeting; 2010 I came to Abuja God said don\u2019t move I kept attending Durumi with papa David Abioye till 30th July same year when Shiloh Word Chapel took off.\n\n.\n\nCrowd Miracles Salvation Souls Everywhere; Yet the prophetic move got me stuck with prophet TB Joshua From the Year 2000 till June 5th 2021. I never looked back we had a deep prophetic Relationship.\n\n.\n\nAs for mantles, evidence are there it will only increase and he said when he gave me a grace double pulpit, I still use it in my church as a mantle and many Blessings anointed bibles; water etc.\n\n.\n\nCharity works mandate one love and humility that attract angels of supernatural signs and wonders watch out But If I Say Only With My Mouth today that I have his mantle without evidence is an insult to him and others.\n\n.\n\nI have evidence before his exit and was proud to have a son like me. In every call or meeting he said so, not just now it can only increase now, My first outing after his exit in Borno State no pastor had gone for such since 12 years.\n\nJune 25-28 great things happened in Exousia TV, it was like TB Joshua Visit In Global Crusade.\n\nTo God Be The Glory DADDY TB Joshua Legacy Lives On As He Said To Us In His Last Word (Watch And Pray ) Humble Prophet I O Samuel.\n\n.\n\nShiloh Will be 10 on 31st July and DADDY Left On 5th June After speaking to me one on one in parables two weeks before; \u201cyou are humble to end my God will bless you I O Samuel my son\u201d that\u2019s why; I cried like a baby when he exited 5th June I call it triple grace to me a tenth year and fifth June, it is clear to me now; I And My Father Are One \ud83d\udca5Said Jesus., said the cleric\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Olympic FLICKs by Tony Ubani (2): Words mean different things to different people",
          "text": "By Tony Ubani, Tokyo\n\nWords often mean different things to different people.\n\nAnywhere in the world, though people speak different languages, you once in a while stumble on familiar words and spellings which however mean different things in your own language or dialect.\n\nIn Yoruba for instance, Otami means enemy. Imagine meeting your Yoruba friend and calling him Otami. While he would retrace his steps from you and reconsider his friendship, you\u2019ve definitely lost a good friend without truly knowing the word which means a good thing in your place is distasteful in another place.\n\nThe same word Otami means friend in Kogi. To a Kogi person, he would hug you passionately when you call him Otami while a Yoruba man would slap (gba oju ee) you. What a funny world. In the great Urhobo land, when you hear OMO ME DOO(a compliment for a son who has done well). In Yoruba, the compliment of OMO MI DOO can mean so many things depending on the interpretation.\n\nOlayemi is a beautiful Yoruba name. But the moment you call an Igbo man OLAYEMI, the meaning automatically changes. OLABISI is another good Yoruba name that changes meaning once addressed to an Igbo man. It can also mean one who destroys. Examples abound everywhere.\n\nLet\u2019s fast-forward to Tokyo, Japan where I\u2019m covering the ongoing Olympic Games. I\u2019ve been wondering whether our forefathers left their footprints in Tokyo with the type of names boldly written on houses and vehicles. I could not come to terms with this one OTU UKU which means a totally different thing in Igbo.\n\nALSO READ: Olympic FLICKs by Tony Ubani (1): Seeing double in Tokyo\n\nI noticed a lot of activities with men and women going in and out of the house making me think twice about the inscription. I wanted to go further to investigate as a Journalist but because of the COVID variant in Tokyo, Delta, Journalists have been barred from mingling with the locals.\n\nSuddenly I saw a man come out from the house and was radiant and spritely as he adjusts his face mask and his belt. I walked away not sure of what the words mean in Japan but confused with the meaning in Igbo language. Onochie Anibeze while in Japan for the 2002 World Cup had equally stumbled on another word \u2014 TOTO KA NKU. He did a masterpiece trying to decipher the words in Japanese and its meaning in Igbo language.\n\nHe ended by saying that Kanku means surplus in Igbo and that \u201cTOTO is better imagined than explained\u201d in that piece. One thing that is certain is that the Japanese have a lot of Nigerian names though with different meanings. Names like Osaka, Chiba, Oku, Toyosu, Shina, Aiya, Aimi, Aika, Akemi, Akira, Aki, Akemi, Akako, Asa, Chika, Chinami, Emiko, Ena, Chizu, Azumi, Amaya. One name that they would not bear is Nwaokeoma. A unique name for Igbo men who are exceptionally handsome. And that\u2019s my name. The gods are wise.\n\nStrange Requests! It\u2019s customary for friends and relatives to make requests once they hear you\u2019ve travelled outside Nigeria. The requests come in different forms. I\u2019ve been inundated with all kinds of requests to buy one thing or the other from the Land of the Rising Sun once the Olympics is over.\n\nMy WhatsApp messages have tripled and more messages flood in every day. Friendship request on my Facebook account has equally doubled. Most of them with dubious intentions. Check this out. I received a message from a con man who told me his brother owns a company in Japan. He wants me to give him my account number to send to his brother to credit me with $5000 Dollars. He will settle me with $1000. Another called on my WhatsApp( a strange number not registered on my phone) to talk of a multi-million business from Japan. Anyway, they\u2019re not aware that a hunter can become the hunted. Let\u2019s move to more trivial mundane requests.\n\nI have heard of Brazilian hair, not Japanese hair. Hair wigs, human hair, Synthetic, Toupee, Extensions, etc. A female friend sent words that I should buy Japanese head ( I guess she meant hair). Never heard that Japanese hair is in high demand. I need to find out from our stylish and stunning beauty Editor of ALLURE, Jemi if Japanese female hair is in vogue.\n\nAlso, My nephew sent a bogus list that included a laptop, palmtop from Japanese renowned manufacturers.\n\nApparently, he knows that when you think of technology and innovation, Japan ranks high globally. He\u2019s expecting me to come back with top Japanese brands like Vaio, Fujitsu, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Kohjinsha. Moving down, my friends( I know you know them), want toys. Toys are usually meant for babies but these men don\u2019t have children in primary schools who can play with toys. I\u2019m lost here. Even from an economic point of view, you can see that demand has overshot the runway. And I\u2019m on the run,\n\nExpensive meal! When you know the size of your pocket, you equally know the places to go to. Covering the strange Olympics at this time of economic meltdown is not child\u2019s play. Corporate organizations who usually pick the bills in exchange for value for visibility on the pages of Newspapers are all trying to balance their books.\n\nGreat footballers who earn millions per week are accepting pay cuts. All hands must be on deck in this survival race. With all restrictions advertised not to enter public buses or taxis, cinemas, Restaurant, shops, etc, one has been subjected to either staying in the hotel or going to the venue of events masked, observing social distance.\n\nThe \u201capiam\u201d ways( short cuts and finding where they sell Nigerian meal is closed. They(Nigerians)too cannot even come as it were before to entertain their own and allow you to taste local delicacies. I was in a fix in my hotel room the other day. The rumbling sound of my stomach increased.\n\nBorborygmus was at work because my stomach was empty. To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God. I literally went to seek the face of God. A meal was ordered and I ate voraciously, not savouring the taste. The bill is what is upsetting my stomach. 3,000 Japanese Yen. Calculations have been made breaking it down to N15,000 per meal. How do I explain to Titi, our financial guru that I ate a plate of food with N15,000?\n\nALSO READ: UFC champions Kamaru Usman, Israel Adesanya nominated for World MMA Awards\n\nCondoms as souvenirs. The founders of the Olympic Games were more concerned with the coming together of all races to preach love and bond together. Baron Pierre de Coubertin who founded the International Olympic Committee in 1896 that led to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 said the joy of the Olympics is more in participation. Things have changed as the nations now test their might with the number of medals won and positions on the medals table.\n\nThe Olympics, no doubt, remain the greatest spectacle on earth. Athletes who attended the Olympics with or without medals cling to the title \u2018Olympian\u2019 jealously. But the fun of the Olympics has been extinguished by the coronavirus pandemic. Ordinarily, athletes who lose in the first round of their events were allowed to stay and have fun till the end of the Games. Not again.\n\nNot at the Tokyo Olympics. Lose and leave the Olympic village in two days. Aware of the fun for athletes and officials, 160,000 condoms were provided but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo organizers also want participants to refrain from any kind of intimate physical activity outside their sport.\n\nThat means: Those condoms we gave you? Don\u2019t use them \u2014 at least not while you\u2019re inside the Olympic bubble. Organizers say athletes should take the condoms home as souvenirs and use them to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. But under no terms are participants to use them or engage in any one-on-one while they are in Japan for the Games. The condoms are good, some people say. My problem is how to bring them home as souvenirs. They\u2019re both for male and female. Those interested should indicate.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The management of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu, has expressed delight at the massive development projects being executed simultaneously at the permanent site of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) Teaching Hospital and College of Medicine, Igbo-Eno, by the administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.\n\nSpeaking when he led members of the management team of UNTH to inspect the ongoing works at the site on Thursday, the Chief Medical Director (CMD), Prof. Obinna Onodugo, disclosed that the vision, the massive projects and the planning are \u201csimply unbelievable\u201d and in keeping with the World Health Organization (WHO) standard.\n\nProf. Onodugo stressed that the members of the UNTH management team were highly impressed and amazed, and commended Gov. Ugwuanyi for holding on tightly to the sound vision in spite of the nation\u2019s economic, security and public health challenges.\n\nThe UNTH CMD, who was led round the ongoing projects alongside members of his team by the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Greg Nnaji and his Health counterpart, Dr. Emmanuel Ikechukwu Obi, added that the health facility which is sited at Igbo-Eno, Enugu North Senatorial District of the state, is another laudable effort of Gov. Ugwuanyi in developing the rural areas and creating more urban centres for socio-economic expansion.\n\n\u201cThis is development moving to a new area. With this you (Ugwuanyi) are actually opening up a new town because this will attract a lot of development around it.\n\n\u201cThis is just fantastic. We are all excited about this. We are happy and I want to say kudos to the Governor of this State (Enugu). This is visionary\u201d, the UNTH CMD said.\n\nIt would be recalled that Gov. Ugwuanyi in his inaugural address promised that \u201cEnugu State under us will pay a special attention to rural development because majority of our people live in the rural areas\u201d, adding that \u201cwe will create more urban areas to boost economic growth; create fresh economic opportunities and reduce pressure on Enugu metropolis\u201d.\n\nAlso commending Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration on the designs and features of the ESUT Teaching Hospital, the College of Medicine buildings and the Students\u2019 Hostels projects at Igbo-Eno, Prof. Onodugo said: \u201cTruly, we saw that the plan is modern; the bed to toilet ratio; there is colour-coding; even the patients\u2019 desks are colour-coded, everything is to standard is as recommended by WHO and this is how it is supposed to be; it is just amazing.\n\n\u201cWe saw elevators and others. We learnt that there is going to be a helipad. Recall that the whole idea of having this type of structure is to reverse medical tourism. So if you really want to reverse medical tourism and you don\u2019t have a place where people (patients) can actually land, then it is not complete.\n\n\u201cIn short, one of the members of the team said that now he believes that there is hope in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Nnaji, thanked the UNTH management team for the validation visit as well as their verdict \u201cthat every facility we are putting on ground here is in line with World best practices\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe went round, they saw the facilities; they appreciated the effort of His Excellency, the Governor in having the foresight, the vision to take the healthcare delivery of the state to another level\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Contractor handling the ESUT Teaching Hospital project, Architect Henry Arinze revealed that the health facility is \u201cconceived as Nigeria\u2019s response to the problem of medical tourism\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cthe governor\u2019s vision was to provide a hospital even if himself is sick, he can be brought here; so he wanted a hospital that has provision for everything and that is what we gave him\u201d.",

Badirudeen died in December last year followed by Gbadegesin and Agoro who died few days ago.\n\nBut, PAG Vice Chairman, Dr Moruf Yusuf, while speaking with journalists, said that the deceased nominees were never appointed as judges, based on the petition to the National Judicial Council (NJC) by the then Attorney General of the state, Prof. Oyelowo Oyewo that the list be withdrawn.\n\nYusuf wondered why the deceased nominees Alhaja Fatima Badirudeen, Mr Wasiu Adetunji Gbadegesin and Mr AbdulRasaq Bolaji-Agoro, were denied appointment by the state government.\n\nHe said that finding had revealed that Makinde was planning to fill the four vacant postion of judges in the state.\n\nHe then called on Makinde to be fair, transparent and consider the interest of all religions in the selection of judges in the state.\n\nYusuf while speaking further also urged Makinde to without wasting more time, obey the 2019 Supreme Court judgement which nulified the appointment of Oba Samuel Adegbola as the Eleruwa of Eruwa.\n\nHe urged Makinde to install the rightful owner of the stool since the dethroned monarch (Adegbola) has been sacked by the Supreme Court after he has spent 21 years on the throne.\n\nYusuf, who spoke further, also advised Makinde to extend cordial relationship to his Deputy, Engineer Rauf Olaniyan.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe remind your Excellency that as at present, the number of non-Muslim Judges are almost double that of Muslim Judges in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cWe advise you, humbly, to redress this and make equitable balance in the ongoing appointments of judges.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, it is also essential that the Governor immediately install the new Eleruwa (Muslim) whom the Supreme Court of Nigeria has so declared.\n\n\u201cDitto, extend cordial relationship to the Deputy Governor of the State.\n\n\u201cClarion call is hereby made to Aare in Council, Seriki Musulumi of Yorubaland; Asiwaju Adini of Oyo State, League of Imam and Alfas of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta etc to do speak the truth to the Governor always as Islam teaches.\u201d",

Justice Nyako of Court No. 2 Federal High Court Abuja, after listening to our application, wherein I raised serious concerns about the safety and medical condition of Our Client, whom ordinarily was supposed to be produced in court on that day, ordered that the Detention Authority (DSS) should allow us access to him.\n\n\u201cUpon our arrival in their office today being the 29th Day of July 2021, conspicuously armed with the Court Order under reference, the officials of the DSS, though admitted being aware of the Said Order but directed Us to come up with a formal application stating the names of persons who are visiting, which request was promptly complied with.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhile we awaited to be admitted for the visit, the officials of the DSS unfortunately came back to inform us that we should go and await further communication from them pending the approval of our request.\n\n\u201cAttached for your ease of reference is a copy of the Court Order under reference.

I cannot categorically confirm to the World the present state of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, as at today.\n\n\u201cIt is to be pointed out that Our Client is presently detained in DSS facility pursuant to an Order of Court, and another Order made by the same Court directing Our access to our Client on specified days, is unfortunately being flouted by the officials of the State Security Services, as they have no reason or justification of any kind to refuse us access.\n\n\u201cWe will formally communicate the Court first thing tomorrow morning on this unfortunate and strange development, and shall keep the World updated.\n\n\u201cShould anything untoward happen to Our Client, the Nigerian Government and the Department of State Security Services should be held responsible.\n\n\u201cLet the world and all responsible Foreign Government take Notice of this dangerous trend.

          "text": "By Bunmi Ogunmodede, News Editor\n\nMinister says Buni\u2019s legitimacy to lead party has collapsed, congresses should be halted\n\nIt\u2019s time for APC chairman to go, says PDP\n\nBuhari, Oyetola, APC hail S\u2019Court judgment\n\nWednesday\u2019s Supreme Court judgment, which ratified the victory of Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, has thrown up a major controversy over the legitimacy of Governor Mai Mala Buni as the All Progressives Congress (APC) national caretaker chairman.\n\nThe Yobe governor was appointed after the removal of elected Chairman Adams Oshiomhole on June 16, last year for an initial six month period, which has been renewed indefinitely.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThree justices of the Supreme Court \u2013 Justice Mary Peter-Odili, Justice Ejembi Eko and Justice Muhammed Saulawa, endorsed a minority judgment.\n\nThe dissenting judgment was read by Justice Peter-Odili: \u201cI do not agree with the majority judgment,\u201dshe said, noting that the APC, by Article 17(4) of its constitution has provided for how its affairs should be managed and what offices its memebrs could occupy at a time.\n\nJustice Peter-Odili added: \u201cThis Article draws strength from Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution. Therefore, when the second respondent (APC) put up a person not qualified to author its nomination by virtue of the provision of Article 1z(4) of its constitution and Section183 of the 1999 Constitution to do so, that document has no validity, and thereby void.\n\nMinister of State for Labour and Employment Festus Keyamo (SAN) in a statement last night on the minority judgment, said it had grave implication for the ruling party.\n\nHe said the party risked being destroyed \u201cfrom top to bottom\u201d by the judiciary, if it ignored what the Justices said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot gamble with this delicate issue. The time to act is now,\u201d he added.\n\nThe senior advocate, who said he was offering his \u201cprofessional bit to the party,\u201d explained that: \u201cThe little technical point that saved Governor Akeredolu was that Jegede failed to join Mai Mala Buni in the suit.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cJegede was challenging the competence of Buni as a sitting governor to run the affairs of the APC as chairman of the caretaker committee. He contends that this is against Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution, which states that a sitting governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever. In other words, had Buni been joined in the suit, the story may have been different today as we would have lost Ondo State to the PDP.\u201d\n\nHe then warned: \u201cAny other person affected by the actions of the Buni-led Committee will henceforth, not fail to join him in any subsequent case in court. These include any subsequent election matter in any part of this country and all the APC congresses that are about to hold. The Supreme Court has just weaponised all those that would be aggrieved by the APC Congresses to proceed to court to challenge the competence of the Buni-led CECPC to organise the Congresses and national convention.\u201d\n\nKeyamo said the APC should terminate the plans to hold its ward congresses on Saturday.\n\nIn recommending what to do, he advocated the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the APC should meet urgently and reconstitute the caretaker committee to exclude those holding executive positions.\n\nHe said since \u201cwe cannot vouch for the legality of any NEC meeting called by Buni now,\u201d the safest is to get two-thirds of NEC members to sign an invitation to summon a NEC meeting\u201d.\n\nThe alternative, according to him, is for the Board of Trustees, which includes the President, to be activated to organize a national convention in line with Article 13 of the APC Constitution.\u201d\n\nA former national secretary of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Kayode Ajulo, said: \u201cThe provision of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) is unambiguous to the effect that \u201cThe Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a former National Secretary of Labour Party, I am quite aware and it is unassailable that the national chairman and the national secretary are the alter egos of a political party chartered with the day-to-day running of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, incontrovertible that the continuous stay of the governor as Chief Executive Officer of the All Progressives Congress runs contrary to the provision of the Constitution and as such may be an albatross on the party, as all he had done before would be null and void, including the nomination of candidates within the period of his so-called leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is apposite to assuage and hint the leadership of the party by reminding same of the decision of Lord Denning of over five decades in the case MACFOY v. UAC LIMITED (1961) 3 ALL E.R where the learned jurist held that: \u201cIf an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the court to set it aside.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhichever way this issue is being tilted, permitting a governor of a State to hold another executive office may create cravings in some governors to become the state chairman of their political parties as being recently tinkered by some of them.\u201d\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described the split decision of the Supreme Court as a verdict that Buni cannot continue to lead the APC as Caretaker Committee Chairman.\n\nThe PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it is an aberration for Buni to serve as Yobe State governor and chairman of the APC at the same time.\n\nOlogbondiyan said: \u201cThat is totally an aberration of the doctrine and dictates as established in the APC Constitution as well as the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cWe insist that the process that led to the emergence of Governor Akeredolu was, and remains a violation of the APC Constitution as well as the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cSection 183 of the 1999 Constitution states that no governor should hold any other position in any capacity, apart from the office of the governor. As you know, this was the major ground upon which we went to the Supreme Court\u201d.",

Abbas said Kyari sent pictures of Vincent in jail and subsequently sent his bank account number to Abbas to which a wire transfer should be made having done a good job as sent by Abbas.\n\n\u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d U.S. Justice department said in a statement.\n\n\u201cApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts.\n\n\u201cOther illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts,\u201d officials said.\n\nAbbas pleaded guilty to multi-million fraud earlier this month and faces up to 20 years in jail.\n\nHe will be sentenced in the coming weeks and will forfeit some of his assets and his rights to appeal while also paying restitution to victims of his years-long fraud.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

It must be pointed out virtually that all the flood incidents above were caused by poor drainage systems as localised rainfall generated the urban flooding. River flooding and coastal flooding are yet to set in.\u201d\n\nNze, therefore, called on stats and local governments, stakeholders, multi-national companies, public-spirited individuals and philanthropists to take measures to prevent flooding menace instead of waiting to be rehabilitated as victims.\n\nMinister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, while presenting the 2021 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) to the public said 302 local government areas in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT) would fall within moderate flood risk areas while 121 LGAs in 28 states will be within the highly probably risk areas.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Adedayo Akinwale\n\nFollowing Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in the Ondo State governorship election, which upheld the victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, the lead counsel of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Michael Akinyola (SAN) during the legal tussle has said the position of the Governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Chairman of the party, Mai Mala Buni is not injurious to the party congresses slated for weekend and the forthcoming Anambra election.\n\nAkintola who addressed a press conference on Thursday morning alongside the Secretary of the party, Sen.

          "text": "Justice Dept\u2019s statement shows Kyari allegedly sent bank account details to Hushpuppi for payment\n\nBy Michael Olugbode\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has been linked to the celebrated fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Ray Hushpuppi, who is presently facing trial for fraud in a United States court.\n\nHushpuppi, in an indictment unsealed by the US Justice Department, was alleged to have bribed Abba Kyari to get one of his traducers arrested and jailed in Nigeria.\n\nArelease by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Central District of California said: \u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas (Hushpuppi) and Juma were engaged in fraud. Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, also known as Ray Hushpuppi\n\n\u201cAfter this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nAbba Kyari, known to have smashed top criminal cases, drew the ire of the public when he made an appearance at the party of Obi Cubana in Oba where millions in various currencies were obscenely displayed recently.\n\nHushpuppi was indicted with five others in an International Scheme to Defraud Qatari School Founder and then launder over $1 Million in Illicit proceeds.\n\nAccording to the release from the Department of Justice, Hushpuppi has pleaded guilty in the Money Laundering in School Financing Scam and Additional Cyber and Business Email Compromise Schemes.\n\nThe criminal complaint that initiated the prosecution in February was also unsealed on Monday, revealing Hushpuppi was initially charged in this case.\n\nCourt documents ordered unsealed showed that Abbas, a 37-year-old Nigerian national, pleaded guilty on April 20. A version of Abbas\u2019 plea agreement filed late Tuesday outlines his role in the school-finance scheme, as well as several other cyber and business email compromise schemes that cumulatively caused more than $24 million in losses.\n\n\u201cThe defendants allegedly faked the financing of a Qatari school by playing the roles of bank officials and creating a bogus website in a scheme that also bribed a foreign official to keep the elaborate pretense going after the victim was tipped off,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, who played a significant role in the scheme, funded his luxurious lifestyle by laundering illicit proceeds generated by con artists who use increasingly sophisticated means. In conjunction with our law enforcement partners, we will identify and prosecute perpetrators of business email compromise scams, which is a massive and growing international crime problem,\u201d according to Wilkison.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbas, among the most high-profile money launderers in the world, has admitted to his significant role in perpetrating global BEC fraud, a scheme currently plaguing Americans,\u201d said Kristi K. Johnson, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\n\u201cHis celebrity status and ability to make connections seeped into legitimate organizations and led to several spin-off schemes in the U.S. and abroad. Today\u2019s announcement deals a crucial blow to this international network and hopefully serves as a warning to potential victims targeted with this type of theft,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Abbas allegedly conspired with Abdulrahman Imraan Juma, a.k.a. \u201cAbdul,\u201d 28, of Kenya, and Kelly Chibuzo Vincent, 40, of Nigeria, to defraud the Qatari businessperson by claiming to be consultants and bankers who could facilitate a loan to finance construction of the planned school.\n\nJuma allegedly posed as a facilitator and consultant for the illusory bank loans, while Abbas played the role of \u201cMalik,\u201d a Wells Fargo banker in New York, according to court documents. Vincent, in turn, allegedly provided support for the false narratives fed to the victim by, among other things, creating bogus documents and arranging for the creation of a fake bank website and phone banking line.\n\nYusuf Adekinka Anifowoshe, a.k.a. \u201cAJ,\u201d 26, of Brooklyn, New York, allegedly played a role in the fraud, assisting Abbas with a call to the victim posing as \u201cMalik.\u201d Special agents with the FBI arrested Anifowoshe in New York on July 22.\n\nThe conspirators allegedly defrauded the victim out of more than $1.1 million.\n\nThe proceeds of the fraud allegedly were laundered in several ways. According to the indictment, Abbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. \u201cMorayo,\u201d 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. \u201cBolamide,\u201d 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22 by FBI agents.\n\nApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts. Other illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\nCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest. Kyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nThebr3lease said both conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term.\n\nIt added that the FBI was investigating this matter as part of Operation Top Dog.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A US Court document has detailed conversations between Nigeria's celebrated Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, and infamous suspected fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, alias Hushpuppi regarding bribery and arrest of another suspected fraudster.\n\nHushpuppi, who recently pleaded guilty in the United States, had narrated how he bribed Kyari.\n\nOfficials said in court filings that Hushpuppi disclosed during interrogation that he paid bribes to Nigeria\u2019s police chief, Kyari, to have one of his rivals arrested and jailed in Nigeria following a dispute over a $1.1 million dupe of a Qatari businessperson.\n\nAbbas had asked Kyari to arrest and jail a fellow fraudster Kelly Chibuzor Vincent after both were locked in a dispute presumably over how to share the $1.1 million loot received from the Qatari businessperson.\n\nVincent subsequently contacted the victim and informed them that they were being scammed by a syndicate involving him and Abbas.\n\nThis elicited anger from Abbas (Hushpuppi), who contacted Kyari to arrest and jail his rival over the dispute.

          "text": "A US Court document has detailed conversations between Nigeria's celebrated Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, and infamous suspected fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, alias Hushpuppi regarding bribery and arrest of another suspected fraudster.\n\nHushpuppi, who recently pleaded guilty in the United States, had narrated how he bribed Kyari.\n\nOfficials said in court filings that Hushpuppi disclosed during interrogation that he paid bribes to Nigeria\u2019s police chief, Kyari, to have one of his rivals arrested and jailed in Nigeria following a dispute over a $1.1 million dupe of a Qatari businessperson.\n\nAbbas had asked Kyari to arrest and jail a fellow fraudster Kelly Chibuzor Vincent after both were locked in a dispute presumably over how to share the $1.1 million loot received from the Qatari businessperson.\n\nVincent subsequently contacted the victim and informed them that they were being scammed by a syndicate involving him and Abbas.\n\nThis elicited anger from Abbas (Hushpuppi), who contacted Kyari to arrest and jail his rival over the dispute. Abbas (Hushpuppi) said Kyari sent pictures of Vincent in jail and subsequently sent a bank account number to him (Hushpuppi) to which a wire transfer should be made having done a 'good' job as sent by Abbas (Hushpuppi).

That is why that matter is still in court.\u201d\n\nOn secessionist agitations, Falana noted that he is opposed to the campaign of the balkanisation of Nigeria but the law guarantees the rights of self-determination.\n\nThe human rights lawyer asked the federal government to respect human rights and always follow the legal approach in dealing with those calling for secession so that the country will be respected among civilised nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnless we respect the rights of our people and the human rights of people in our country, we are going to be embarrassed continuously,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd that is what has just happened in the United States, where a senator has moved a motion that certain aircraft should not be sold to Nigeria because of gross human rights violation.\n\n\u201cI have a fundamental disagreement, a fundamental ideologically disagreement with those calling for the break-up of the country along ethnic lines but the law has imposed a duty on the government.\n\n\u201cAnd the rest of us, respect the rights of such people and in fact article 20 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights guarantees the rights to self-determination.\u201d",

          "text": "Abba Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police, is in dire straits. The celebrated police officer has now been embroiled in the cyber fraud case against Hushpuppi, the embattled Nigerian socialite who \u2014 according to a US court filing \u2014accused him of taking a bribe to arrest an associate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHushpuppi, whose real name is Ramon Abbas, was infamously arrested in the UAE in June 2020 alongside 11 of his associates over allegations bordering on hacking, impersonation, scamming, bank fraud, and identity theft.\n\nHis extradition to the US came after the UAE police had carried out a special operation dubbed \u2018Fox Hunt 2\u2019. Hushpuppi was accused of defrauding 1.9 million persons of N168 billion. The Instagram celebrity was later arraigned and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Chicago ahead of trial.\n\nOn Wednesday, he pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge, which could earn him as much as 20 years in jail if found guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot many saw it coming but it is here all the same: Kyari was dragged into the saga after the US department of justice quoted Hushpuppi as telling the court that he bribed the DCP to jail Chibuzor Vincent, an associate with whom he was locked in a dispute over how to share $1.1 million proceeds of a fraudulent deal with some Qatari business executives.\n\nVincent was said to have alerted the victim and told him he was being scammed by Hushpuppi\u2019s syndicate. It was on this basis, the court documents stated, that Hushpuppi was said to have contacted Kyari to facilitate his arrest.\n\nHushpuppi alleged that Kyari sent him photos of Vincent in jail and followed this up with a bank account number to which a wire transfer should be made for the successful arrest and detention of his co-fraudster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs news of the alleged dealings with the embattled socialite became public knowledge, Kyari denied the allegations. He said he only facilitated Hushpuppi\u2019s purchase of native clothing and that there hadn\u2019t been a bribe. The DCP added that Hushpuppi made a distress call after threats were allegedly issued to his family by Vincent. But the indictment won\u2019t be the first allegation of impropriety to be made against the top police officer.\n\nSuper cop tasked with high-profile assignments\n\nKyari, born March 17, 1975, leads the inspector-general of the police intelligence response team (IGP-IRT). He is regarded as a no-nonsense investigator and has a track record of being saddled with high-profile assignments. Kyari led the operation that led to the arrest of Chukwudi Onuamadike, the notorious kidnap kingpin better known as Evans, in 2017.\n\nMost recently, the crack investigator, who has won the police medal for courage three years in a row, was deployed to probe the attack on Samuel Ortom, Benue state governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGunmen had opened fire on Ortom\u2019s convoy while he was visiting a farm in Benue on March 20, 2021.\n\nThe governor had accused \u201cherders\u201d of carrying out the attack and Mohammed Adamu, the former IGP, subsequently deployed Kyari\u2019s team to investigate the incident.\n\n\u201cThe Team, led by DCP Abba Kyari \u2013 a no-nonsense investigator \u2013 consists of operatives from the Tactical Investigation Units of the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) and other experienced, crack detectives with specialized competencies in crime scene investigation and reconstruction, ballistics, fingerprint analysis and other core areas of forensics,\u201d Frank Mba, police spokesman, had said.\n\nBut despite his well-publicised sterling qualities as a police officer, Kyari has also been accused of several acts unbecoming of a supposedly model cop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN41 million \u2018extortion\u2019 case\n\nIn October 2020, Kyari was accused of extorting N41 million from one Afeez Mojeed, a Lagos-based businessman. Mojeed claimed the extortion was done in 2014 when Kyari was the officer in charge of the now-disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS) in Lagos. The accuser said he unsuccessfully sought justice at the Independent Corrupt Practices And Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).\n\nIn a petition filed on October 22, 2020, through Salawu Akingbolu & Co, and addressed to the Lagos judicial panel of inquiry for victims of SARS-related abuses, Kyari and his officers were accused of forcefully taking about 32 items from Mojeed\u2019s house during a raid in 2014. The businessman, who was at home with his pregnant wife, an 18 month-old son, and mother-in-law, said he thought it was a robbery.\n\nHe said phones, cheque books, bank cards, and documents were taken. After ransacking the house, Mojeed was reportedly taken to the SARS office in Ikeja where he was detained for 14 days. He was later \u201carraigned on a trumped-up charge\u201d of stealing N97 million. In the documents seen by TheCable at the time, it was alleged that for over one year during which the matter was in court, the police \u201cnever showed up or brought any witness\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey forcefully took his wedding ring and that of his wife from them, opened their wardrobe and took the sum N280,000 and the sum of N50,000 was also taken from his car, after which the Honda Accord (2008) model was seized and taken away till today,\u201d the petition read, adding that the charges against him were later struck out in court.\n\nNarrating his ordeal, Mojeed said while in detention, \u201cthe police under the supervision and threat of Abba Kyari (OC SARS) forced him to sign three Zenith Bank cheques in the sum of N150,000 each, making N450,000 on October 22 to 23, 2014 and gave the sum to Alabi Olawale Nurudeen who is one of their cronies to withdraw\u201d.\n\nThe police allegedly obtained a password to his bank card and withdrew another N395,000 between October 20 and 23, 2014. Allegedly on the directive of Kyari, Mojeed was taken by \u201cone Inspector Fola, Corporal Bolu and Corporal Akeem to Diamond Bank Ajah branch on October 23 and 24 to forcefully transfer N41 million and N800,000\u201d from his corporate account into the account of one Obinna Edward, whom Mojeed stated he had never seen or heard of before.\n\nAlleged asset seizures, \u2018extrajudicial killings\u2019\n\nIn 2018, Amnesty International and the NHRC accused Kyari of illegally depleting the assets of one Collins Ezenwa, a suspected criminal, after his team shot the man dead. Ezenwa\u2019s wife, at the time, said Kyari and his team withdrew money from her late husband\u2019s account and pocketed millions from his hotels.\n\nKyari denied corruption amongst his team but did not categorically address the allegations made by Ezenwa\u2019swife.\n\nBefore the hearings of the Lagos judicial panel on #EndSARS, Kyari\u2019s squad had been accused of extrajudicial killings. In late 2019, a federal high court sitting in Jos, Plateau had threatened to jail Abubakar Mohammed, the then-IGP, and Kyari, for disobeying its orders.\n\nThis was after the duo failed to produce a suspect, Nanpon Sambo, who was alleged to have died in police custody in Abuja.\n\nYears after that incident, Kyari \u2014 who recently made headlines after he was spotted at the lavish funeral of Obi Cubana\u2019s mother \u2014 now finds himself in the law\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThe revered criminal hunter is now haunted by his alleged sins.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMore than 70% of the lifecycle of any building is in maintenance.\u201d\n\nThese were the words of Femi Akintude, Group CEO, Alpha Mead Group (AMG), at the launch of its latest product, the Call2Fix app, recently.\n\nAMG is a Total Real Estate Solutions company that provides facilities management (FM), Real Estate development, training, warehousing and logistics services, amongst others. It is the first FM company in Nigeria to be certified to international standards \u2014 ISO 9001: 2015.\n\nSeveral research papers on the building maintenance culture in Nigeria serve to corroborate Akintude\u2019s words. They also highlight the country\u2019s failure in this regard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2018 research paper done by the Faculty of Engineering, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, revealed that 80% of the buildings on campus required maintenance. To persons familiar with the system, these numbers would not come as a surprise.\n\nAlpha Mead hopes to solve this problem, and after almost 36 months of research, the company has officially launched its Call2Fix app.\n\nAccording to Akintude, the app was developed to address the challenges involved in home management and maintenance.\n\nWhile expanding on why access to these services should not be the exclusive preserve of the affluent, he says the goal of this initiative is to \u201ccontinuously connect people and organisations in need of these services with trained artisans or material suppliers from the comfort of their mobile devices.\u201d\n\nRecognising the emergence of the proptech industry in Nigeria, Akintude says the company is leveraging its existing processes and systems with technology as the nexus between these operations.\n\nWhy Call2Fix?\n\nSesan Ogunyooye, Head of Marketing, AMG, noted six pain points in the FM sector: low-level artisan skills, increasing safety and insecurity concerns, unprofessional conducts, highly manual and human-led, largely informal and concentrated in the B2B space, and a less than 0.01% contribution to Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nTo solve these problems, the company has four value propositions: reliability, security, convenience, and accountability.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nWith the motto, \u201cYou call, we fix,\u201d Ogunyooye calls the app \u201ca ride-hailing service, but for home management.\u201d Like the popular Uber app, with Call2Fix, you can find technicians close to you, and they are rated using a 5-star system based on customer recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownloading the app is free, and so is creating an account. You can choose to open several at once, depending on if you want to be a customer, service provider, materials supplier, or all.\n\nThere\u2019s also the enterprise account option, which enables organisations to give employees admin rights for all their requests and maintenance concerns.\n\nAs a customer, you can state your needs via the app or call the company. You also have the option of using the video and visual features to relay what needs fixing. Once you make your request, an artisan is assigned to you.\n\nFor service providers, you have to be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with at least a business name. You must also have a bank account under your business name.\n\nAll artisans under a service provider are subjected to background checks. When a customer reports an artisan, they are immediately blacklisted, investigated and perhaps, let go.\n\nThere\u2019s also a marketplace where you can purchase materials directly through the app. So, for example, you can rent ladders or buy a PVC pipe without leaving your home. To prevent overpricing, you make payments via the app and not to the artisan. When your problem has been evaluated, you can choose between five quotes. What this does is give you a range of choices depending on your pocket.\n\nInterestingly, customers might get access to loans to purchase items and pay for services. However, Ogunyooye says the feature is still in beta mode.\n\nFor convenience, you can reschedule appointments. You can also create a requester account that a family member or domestic help can access.\n\nTraining and Expansion plans\n\nAccording to Ogunyooye, the company plans to organise training for artisans. An endeavour not new to the company has previously partnered with the Lagos State Technical and Vocational Education Board to teach soft skills.\n\nThis aligns with AMG\u2019s goal to use Call2Fix to unlock the economic potentials within the FM industry for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Real Estate sector.\n\nCurrently, the company is present only in Lagos, but Ogunyooye revealed that over the next three months, Call2Fix would expand into major cities in Nigeria.\n\nThere are also plans to expand to other African countries where Alpha Mead\u2019s services are available. A \u201cplug and play\u201d, so to speak.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to own the largest market share in the FM industry.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "4 tech tools to help people with dyslexia overcome workplace and school challenges",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Yusuff was withdrawn from the university in his third year. He was quite intelligent, but his reading difficulties affected his education.\n\n\u201cI kept failing my courses because reading to understand was difficult. People said I was smart back in school, but they never saw my reading difficulty. Therefore, when I failed, they were disappointed,\u201d he recounts.\n\nIn January 2019, Chioma, a 26-year old accountant, attended a 4-day career development bootcamp for young people, but she struggled throughout the programme, with reading one of her major challenges.\n\nOn the third day of the bootcamp, all 18 participants were to summarise a 7-page PDF document. Everyone but Chioma found it easy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cReading was tough. I felt embarrassed because I couldn\u2019t read past the first page. I simply was looking around trying to understand how easy it was for my colleagues to read and understand.\n\n\u201cI remember walking up to one of the participants, an acquaintance, and asking her to summarise everything she had read. However, she shut me out, telling me to read. I tell you, I was very mortified and felt bad for having dyslexia,\u201d Chioma says.\n\nDyslexia seems to be a common learning disability in Africa. The Africa Dyslexia Organisation (ADO) \u2014 an organisation dedicated to increasing awareness, providing support, and advocating for dyslexics in Africa \u2014 estimates that \u201c15% to 20% of any population may be dyslexics.\u201d\n\nThe ADO also states that most Africans are unaware of their conditions, and with most adults and children suffering in silence, people misunderstand dyslexia. Occasionally mistaken for a vision condition, people consider it to be writing backwards or reversing letters.\n\nPer the International Dyslexia Association, dyslexia is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it is a learning disability that affects not only children and adolescents \u2014 adults in many settings, including the workplace, who have dyslexia and may have trouble processing information.\n\nOften overwhelmed with written or spoken information, people with dyslexia require more time to process what\u2019s before them. This makes it difficult for them to follow lengthy conversations or understand lengthy information.\n\nThey are also unlikely to be able to communicate information in writing or speaking correctly. Although they know what to say, they sometimes don\u2019t know how to, which can be confusing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael*, a graduate of the University of Lagos, had only been working for three months when he resigned because he experienced difficulties replicating information, retrieving files, and organising his work.\n\n\u201cTaking down instructions was difficult because I forget things said in less than three seconds. Just imagine trying to hear and write down the first sentence, and just when you try writing the first two words, you just can\u2019t remember the next two or three words that make up the sentence. It was really frustrating,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to studies, dyslexia has no known cause or cure. However, dyslexics can still receive the assistance they need to overcome barriers and conquer their obstacles using assistive technology (AT).\n\nAssistive tech tools to help dyslexics function better at school or the workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nAccording to the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity, AT empowers dyslexics by helping them do their work quicker and overcoming their challenges, for instance, with reading and writing. As a result, they can demonstrate their strengths in new ways.\n\nNumerous assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events. We have identified four tools that can help dyslexics succeed academically and professionally.\n\nImmersive Reader\n\nThe Immersive Reader is a free tool that improves reading comprehension, fluency, and writing. It also boosts the confidence of budding readers with dyslexia. It\u2019s available in OneNote, Word, Office Lens for iOS, Microsoft Edge, and the web version of Outlook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmersive Reader in Microsoft Edge\n\nThis tool assists in breaking words into syllables, highlighting verbs, nouns, adjectives, and subordinate sentences, and the conversion of text to speech.\n\nIt can also pick a font designed to help users read comfortably and change font size, spacing, and background colour.\n\nGrammarly\n\nLaunched in 2009, Grammarly is an app that helps people improve their spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, and engagement. It offers both free and premium options.\n\nThe app is recommended for dyslexic students and employees since it enables them to write better.\n\nAvailable on the Google Play Store and the App Store, Grammarly can also be added as an extension for Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and Google Chrome.\n\nQuillbot\n\nQuillbot is a valuable tool that enables dyslexics to function more effectively at work or school. It assists in rewriting sentences to improve reading and writing clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it aids in the summarisation of content for clarity. It also offers free and premium options.\n\nExecutive functioning tools\n\nPeople with dyslexia often struggle with executive functioning, which requires planning a task, switching gears if necessary, and getting a team back on track. So they need organisational tools to help them achieve success.\n\nEvernote is a multipurpose application that makes it possible to manage to-do lists, make voice recordings, and scan business cards, receipts, documents, and handwritten notes.\n\nIf you have a lot of to-do lists, Microsoft To Do is a helpful tool. It can be used to manage several lists, set reminders, and keep track of critical notes, documents, or voice recordings associated with specific activities. The app is compatible with iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and laptops.\n\nWhile the Google Calendar app reminds you of events that prepare you to make the most of every day, ActiveInbox integrates seamlessly with your email, converting emails that demand action or follow-up into tasks.\n\nActiveInbox includes a \u201csend later\u201d mode that enables you to schedule emails to be delivered at a specific time.\n\nMind mapping software is a brainstorming tool that enables you to generate visual representations of your ideas to organise and comprehend information better. It is specifically created to assist dyslexics in efficiently planning their work tasks. Mindly and Coggle are examples of such software.\n\nUsing evaluation and instructional help, more tech tools like word processing, voice recorder, spell check, word prediction, and speech recognition can assist in learning, reading, writing, and editing.\n\nWhy dyslexics should use AT\n\nWhile dyslexia impairs an individual\u2019s ability to learn easily or rapidly regardless of the educational approach used, AT has helped to minimise dyslexics\u2019 reliance on others to read, write, and organise their work.\n\nDyslexia is caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language. The brain struggles to connect letters to their associated sounds and mix those sounds into words, slowing down and complicating reading.\n\nDyslexia can also affect daily abilities and activities such as social interaction, memory, and stress management. Moreso, it affects grammar, reading comprehension and fluency, sentence structure, spelling, listening, writing, and motor control. Thus, adopting AT at school or the workplace is essential.\n\nAdditionally, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nSometimes, the signs of dyslexia may not appear until later in life, when more advanced cognitive skills prove to be difficult for people with dyslexia.\n\nFurthermore, several of the indications are emotion and behaviour-based. Dyslexics may be reluctant to read aloud or to themselves, and while reading, they may become worried or frustrated. This happens even if they have learned the fundamentals of reading. Hence, the use of AT tools to help them perform better.\n\nWhile AT can be beneficial for dyslexics, Charles MacArthur, a Professor of Special Education at the University of Delaware, said that technology has minimal effect on learning.\n\nTherefore, dyslexics can do considerably better at work or school if they have support from their parents, coworkers, teachers, classmates, or friends while they use AT.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "An insight into how early-stage venture firm, LoftyInc Capital Management, invests in African startups",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Reliance HMO, a Nigerian health insurance startup, and Printivo, a print-on-demand startup from Nigeria, have nothing in common. But they do. They are both portfolio companies of LoftyInc Capital Management, creators of Wennovation Hub, Nigeria\u2019s first private incubator.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, Wennovation Hub is the product of a partnership between LoftyInc Allied Partners and the Africa Leadership Forum.\n\nWith startup investing yet to catch on at the time, the plan was to put African startups through an incubator and subsequently present them to institutional investors who could write large cheques. Two years later, while trying to raise money for some of the startups at Wennovation, the partners experienced firsthand how difficult it was for startups to raise money.\n\nInspired by the Houston Angel Network, they decided to set up the LoftyInc Angel Network in Nigeria. But those plans changed when they approached infoDev \u2014 a World Bank programme that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation \u2014 for sponsorship as they were advised to broaden its scope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so, in June 2012, together with a few other African angel investors including Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, the Lagos Angel Network was formed.\n\nHowever, there was still a lot to be done before it could become fully operational. After seeing several startups that needed capital remain without funding, Bello and a few other friends withdrew money from their pension funds to start the Afropreneur Angel Group in 2012.\n\nOne of their earliest investments was in Fora, which would go on to become Andela. From those humble beginnings, the Afropreneur Angel Group has grown to 180 global angels who have invested in 134 companies. Sixty-four of these are African, with Nigeria the most represented country, while 70 are spread across three continents.\n\nWhat sets LoftyInc Capital Management apart?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nWith early-stage investing gathering pace in Africa and with the founding of more startups, it is no longer enough to write cheques for startups. Investors now need to be able to offer more than money to the startups they invest in with access to a diverse network and mentorship highly valued by founders.\n\nFrom its early days, the firm has been intent on offering startups more than just money. Bello reveals that the firm has a reputation for being a founder\u2019s friend while serving as extended strategy teams in a startup\u2019s early days.\n\n\u201cWe usually invest before any major investor does, hold the hand of new founders, source their initial clients within our large portfolio (over 65 African startups) and within our large Africa-based Angel/LP network, and provide meaningful introductions to regulators, partners, mentors, top hires and experienced board directors. Also, founders want us in their deals because they have seen us attract both early and later-stage investors to previous ventures,\u201d he reveals.\n\nDeal-sourcing pipelines\n\nBello points out that having backed founders for a long time, they now have five major sources through which they source deals. On average, he says that the firm sees 20 to 30 decks weekly, which makes it important that they pick the right startups to fund.\n\nOne of the most effective sources is through the personal networks of the partners. Besides Bello, Marsha Wulff is an authority on investing in Africa. Through Wennovation Hub, they are also assured of a steady stream of deals from which they can choose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith 180 angels and 70 Limited Partners \u2014 90% of whom are of African origin and/or live in Africa \u2014 the firm gets many deals. Other sources include the over 60 founders who have been funded and other investors aware of LoftyInc\u2019s commitment to helping startups grow.\n\nCriteria for investing in startups\n\nLoftyInc is a sector-agnostic firm that invests in startups building products that users really need.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for balanced founding teams, with a bias towards execution, going after a large market with few to no competitors, and a product that users seriously want/need. We are sector-agnostic with a bias for tech-enabled startups in the health, fintech, and IoT space.\n\n\u201cGiven the robustness of our deal flow, the ultimate differentiator is the ability to pick the ventures that go on to grow and scale and raise additional funding. In doing so, we have found our experiences launching startups, building larger corporations, and angel investing have proven invaluable,\u201d Bello adds.\n\nHe reveals that their process means that they identify gaps in the skills and capabilities of the founders they support and put procedures in place that enable them to fill these gaps. In doing this, they can count on their experience and the experiences of the investors and limited partners in their fund to help the founders.\n\nFor startups that they fund, the average ticket size is between $50,000 and $250,000 for the initial investments, with the possibility of additional funding depending on certain criteria. Startups seeking investment can head over to the website to start the process.\n\nHe advises that startups do not get carried away by the hype that usually accompanies startups but should focus on building for their customers and not investors. On the type of startups he would love to see, he says, \u201cI want to see startups lift more people out of poverty by creating solutions that also create other opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Experts canvass UK model to fix Nigeria\u2019s housing delivery problems",
          "text": "As Nigeria\u2019s housing demand-supply gap continues to widen as a result of delivery problems investors have to contend with, experts have canvassed the use of the UK model to fix the problems.\n\nIn Nigeria, housing delivery is largely private-sector driven unlike the UK where, the experts say, the government plays a major role, creating policy and regulatory environment for delivery of affordable housing through the Ministry of Housing and a dedicated agency known as Homes England.\n\n\u201cThe government planning department is required by law to ensure that adequate land is available and dedicated for affordable housing based on data on housing need,\u201d Kemi Olomola-Sijuwade, a UK-based realtor, explained.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing\n\nWhile many developers in Nigeria get involved in the development of many house-types, including residential, industrial and commercial, Kemi Olomola-Sijuwade said that, in the UK, developers focus on delivery of housing specialising in specific market segments.\n\nRead Also: Singapore\u2019s funding model could solve Nigeria\u2019s housing deficit\n\nOn the financing side, mortgage providers focus on ensuring availability of mortgages, limiting the exit risk of developers.\n\nBesides this, all stakeholders need to collaborate, working together as a team and building support for one another in order to find a solution. There are issues of poor infrastructure, currency risk, security issues, economic contraction and devaluation of the naira.\n\nOther challenges facing the sector, according to Gbenga Olaniyan, CEO, Estate Links, are limited sources of funding for real estate development and investment, changing consumer patterns which are bringing forth heavy rental vacancies, and hike in cost of construction.\n\nOlaniyan along with Olomola-Sijuwade, spoke at the just concluded Abuja International Housing Conference. He noted that these challenges have been worsened by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, leading to a significant drop in housing supply across the board.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely unlikely that we can make much progress without significant improvement in the collaboration between the public and private sector players,\u201d Olomola-Sijuwade said, stressing that the public sector must embrace the responsibility to create enabling environment including land, statutory approvals, financing, developer incentives, standards and customer protection.\n\nOn its part, she said, the private sector must bring discipline and innovation to the design and construction of homes.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing problem as reflected in its 20 million units\u2019 deficit and about 100,000 annual output which basically resides in affordable housing for low income earners. Though some analysts say affordable housing is not social housing, others describe it as that house-type that does not take more than 30 percent of household income to buy.\n\nTo bridge its housing gap, Nigeria needs to deliver about 200,000 annually for the next 10-20 years. To realize this goal, it has been suggested that the government should establish special financing and impact investing schemes such as Real Estate Investment Funds (REITs).\n\nStakeholders should also establish a Working Group of Stakeholders (WGS) who are committed to supporting the affordable housing agenda. The group must also engage in joint planning towards the creation of affordable housing at different levels of society.\n\n\u201cThis joint planning must be intentionally geared towards establishing a framework for inclusive development that can be cascaded to the lowest strata of the society in terms of achieving the affordable housing agenda,\u201d Ugochukwu Chime, former chairman of Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), explained.\n\nSetting up State Affordable Housing Commissions as a public private partnership between state governments and organized private sector developers, academics, main landowners, building material suppliers etc is another good route to solving the housing problem.\n\nThis commission, according to him, should be jointly managed by the private and public sector to be led by a representative board including all stakeholders with leadership by rotation.\n\n\u201cThe commission is to be funded by modest subscription by stakeholders, grants, government subvention or private sector contribution. One tool that can be used to achieve the required funding challenge is to set up a Housing Trust Fund with the specific purpose of creating and preserving housing for low- and moderate-income individuals within the state,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "As Nigeria\u2019s housing demand-supply gap continues to widen as a result of delivery problems investors have to contend with, experts have canvassed the use of the UK model to fix the problems.\nIn Nigeria, housing delivery is largely private-sector driven unlike the UK where, the experts say, the government plays a major role, creating policy and regulatory environment for delivery of affordable housing through the Ministry of Housing and a dedicated agency known as Homes England.\nNigeria\u2019s housing problem as reflected in its 20 million units\u2019 deficit and about 100,000 annual output which basically resides in affordable housing for low income earners.\nThough some analysts say affordable housing is not social housing, others describe it as that house-type that does not take more than 30 percent of household income to buy.\nThe group must also engage in joint planning towards the creation of affordable housing at different levels of society.",

          "title": "Supreme Court Judgment On Akeredolu Vindicated Me Why APC Will Lose Anambra And Others \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIn June I wrote an article to warn APC that it will lose Anambra, Ekiti and Osun elections. My advice was ignored. Supreme Court ruling on Akeredolu versus Jegede has vindicated me. By this judgment, it is clear that APC is out of Anambra 2021 governorship election.\n\nAPC has conducted its party primary for Anambra-2021 under Buni and that is illegal now. If APC conducts its primaries for Ekiti-2022 and Osun-2022 elections, it will lose because caretaker committee is strange to APC constitution. Caretaker committee is illegal.\n\nThe leadership of the party the All Progressives Congress, APC must act fast to avoid a situation where all their candidates for Anambra, Ekiti and Osun gubernatorial elections 2021-2022 will be disqualified and even lose their seats to the opposition if they win the main election. I am worried over Kolapo ALIMI in Osun who was illegally suspended on social media in Osun State at a time when the party wants to get more members. APC constitution does not recognize caretaker committee talk less of their activities. The tenure of APC chairman in Osun expired in 2018. Gboyega Famodun; the Chairman of the caretaker committee of the party in Osun is acting illegally, mismanaging APC plurality, the equivalent of sowing seeds of discord among members, and it is strange to APC constitution.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun Gubernitorial Elections because the All Progressives Congress National Working Committee organized a strange meeting in a strange location, Federal Executive Council Chamber and took a strange decision not known to the APC constitution to wit: dissolution of NWC. The Party also set up a strange body called a caretaker committee, sworn in by a strange person, Attorney General of the Federation, who by APC constitution is not allowed to hold a party position. APC is preparing to conduct party primaries for Anambra 2021, Osun and Ekiti 2022 elections with an illegal caretaker that is strange to the party constitution.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun gubernitorial elections because \u201cthe APC constitution provides in Article 18(iv) \u201cNo officer in any organ of the Party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently.\u201d The word dissolution is not in the APC constitution, that the action of dissolution is unlawful and illegal.\n\nAPC will lose Anambra, Ekiti, Osun gubernitorial elections because\u201d dissolving elected party administrators in a wrongly constituted meeting is a coup against the constitution of the party,\u201d \u201cthe Caretaker Committee membership is also a violation of the Article 18(iv), which forbids an elected governor from holding a party position.\u201d\n\nFurther, that this \u201cillegal appointment and oath administered to the governor of Yobe is a violation of his oath of office as governor and a gross abuse of his office as governor. He should resign and rescind that oath immediately.\u201d I want to demand that parties should keep to their constitutions.\n\nThe practice of democracy in Osun APC is today a mockery to democratic principles. Governor Oyetola and Gboyega Famodun; the Chairman of the caretaker committee of the party in Osun, want to stop democratic ethos and institutions that promote and defend mass participation and rule of law in Osun APC. These duo and their hangers-on do not want members of Osun APC to freely choose candidates for elective offices within party. All they want is the imposition of themselves and their favorites through dubious consensus, on the Party.\n\nMembers of APC respected the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Oshiomhole-Led NWC, and his instruction that no member of the party must approach the courts to resolve any party related case for now, and even those already in court should withdraw their cases. President Buhari knew the legal implication of his action against Oshiomhole.\n\nHowever, all it takes is for one dissatisfied member to approach the court to determine if the decision reached by a caretaker executive or leadership at the ward, local government and state level (which by the way is not recognized by the party constitution, talk less of one whose tenure had originally expired) is in tandem with the constitution of the APC and by extension, if all the decisions taken by them in the course of holding sway is valid or null and void.\n\nA simple case of fighting the suspension of a party member can snowball into removal of elected officials. While I\u2019m not advising aggrieved party faithful to approach the courts, it is important for APC leaders to discourage a situation where arbitrary decisions are made against law abiding party members in Osun and others.\n\nMy attention has been drawn to a purported suspension Kolapo Alimi by the APC caretaker committee in Osun State, Elerin, ward 9, Irepodun South LCDA, Erin-Osun, State of Osun. The purported suspension of Alimi Kolapo came to me as a rude shock because according to Article 21 of APC Constitution, \u201cSUSPENSION\u201d is categorized under \u201cPUNISHMENT\u201d and before any member could be punished, such a person ought to have been alleged of any form of misconduct against the party and ought to be given the opportunity to defend him/herself.\n\nIn the instant case, nobody has accused him of any misconduct either orally or by writing, formally or informally. And he was not invited by any Committee of the party, either at ward, Local Government level or at State Level to come and defend any allegations whatsoever.\n\nHowever, I need to state a fact that might be the root cause of this suspension, the Chairman of Alimi\u2019s ward, who coordinated the suspension under the heavy presence of the Police, Mr Tajudeen Adebayo a.k.a Lekosta is the immediate younger brother to S.A sanitation to Governor Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nI want to state clearly that APC WILL LOSE ANAMBRA, EKITI, OSUN GUBERNITORIAL ELECTIONS 2021-2022 because of its disregard to the relevant provisions of APC Constitution and the 1999 constitution of Nigeria as amended.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\n...",
          "summary": "Share FacebookTwitterStumbleuponLinkedInPinterestIn June I wrote an article to warn APC that it will lose Anambra, Ekiti and Osun elections.\nIf APC conducts its primaries for Ekiti-2022 and Osun-2022 elections, it will lose because caretaker committee is strange to APC constitution.\nAPC constitution does not recognize caretaker committee talk less of their activities.\nThe practice of democracy in Osun APC is today a mockery to democratic principles.\nMy attention has been drawn to a purported suspension Kolapo Alimi by the APC caretaker committee in Osun State, Elerin, ward 9, Irepodun South LCDA, Erin-Osun, State of Osun.",

          "text": "Ikeja Electric says some of the challenges facing the power distribution company include an outstanding N70.97 billion debt owed to the company by its customers.\n\nUgo Obi-Chukwu, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the bulk of the debt was owed by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). He said efforts were ongoing to ensure the repayment of the debt.\n\nMr Obi-Chukwu made the disclosure during a visit of the Senate Committee on Privatisation and Commercialization to the company on Thursday in Lagos.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the committee was led on the oversight visit by its Chairman, Theodore Orji, a former Governor of Abia.\n\nAccording to Mr Obi-Chukwu, Ikeja Electric had estimated a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) that would strengthen its distribution network, improve revenue collection, reduce technical losses and efficient service delivery going forward.\n\nHe said other challenges facing the company included energy theft, difficulty in accessing foreign exchange to procure equipment, volatility of the naira and disruptions from the transmission network.\n\nMetering customers\n\nThe company also said it had installed prepaid meters for about 400,000 customers out of 1.1 million since 2013.\n\nMr Obi-Chukwu noted that the number of metered customers under Ikeja Electric was the highest among all the 11 DisCos.\n\nHe said the company was intensifying efforts to further bridge the metering gap.\n\nHe said the DisCo had been making investments to upgrade its network in order to guarantee reliable and stable power supply to its customers.\n\nMr Obi-Chukwu said the company in the past few years came up with innovative ideas that would ensure customer satisfaction for its commercial and residential customers.\n\nHe said the development led to the bi-lateral power optimisation being utilised by some areas in Lagos State such as Magado, Ogudu Government Reservation Area ( G.R. A), Ikeja G.R.A, Gbagada Phase Two, among others.\n\nHe said the Service-Based Tariff used by the company in these locations was adopted by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in the new national tariff model.\n\nEarlier in her address of welcome, Folake Soetan, chief executive officer, Ikeja Electric, thanked the lawmakers for the visit to the company.\n\nMrs Soetan attributed the company\u2019s achievements to collaboration with NERC, the Bureau of Public Enterprises and other stakeholders.\n\nShe said the company would continue to invest in modern technology and equipment to ensure quality power supply to its customers.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr Orji said the visit of the committee was in line with its statutory responsibility to oversight privatised entities for better performances.\n\nMr Orji noted that the debt owed the DisCo was huge and an impediment to its vision of providing quality supply of electricity to its customers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe assured the management of the company that the legislative arm of government would look into the issue since majority of the debt was owed by MDAs.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nThe Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan has reiterated that the Pan African bank remains the payment gateway for Africa. Akinwuntan who was speaking on the topic \u201cOptimizing sustainable trade, investment and regional economic integration through effective partnerships between ECOWAS institutions and regional institutions and the organized private sector\u201d at a webinar organised by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) to commemorate the 46th anniversary of ECOWAS on Monday, stated that the bank\u2019s state of the art digital payment and collection platform is promoting trade and commerce across the African continent.\n\nAccording to him, Ecobank is present in all ECOWAS member states, stressing that the bank will continue to leverage its knowledge, footprint, and payment channels to promote trade and economic activities through its unique and large pan-African network that positions it to support businesses at all levels. He noted that \u201cnaturally for us as a Pan African bank, we are set up to support the economic integration and development of Africa. We have the commitment, capacity and network to support the realization of that objective.\n\nWe have a platform that leverages technology which enables businesses within ECOWAS to operate as one market. In terms of payment and collection, we have just one banking platform that serves an entire industry. If you are an individual and you open an account and get our Mobile app, you have access to the 33 countries where we operate, and you can transact across these countries.\n\nIt is a payment switch that ensures payment without going through SWIFT but ensures instant value across the network. For businesses, we have Omni platform, which is a web-based payment platform that enables you to first see your position across the 33 countries and make instant payment.\u201d\n\nMr. Akinwuntan added that Ecobank is also providing access to market without language barriers; building capacity of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and empowering women through various products such as the highly innovative Ellevate, a woman focused package targeting at least 40milion women owned business in the MSME space across Africa, by supporting them to become big businesses.\n\n\u201cWe provide access to the market, we know the continent, we know the sub-region and ECOWAS, this is part of what we offer at Ecobank. When you discuss with us in Ecobank, we are able to translate into the language you understand. Our financial statements are in English and French. In terms of MSMEs, which are critical, we have put in place an MSME Academy in partnership with AUDA-NEPAD solely for capacity building. But more importantly, we have also set aside N100 billion in Nigeria to support MSMEs. We have a regional trade desk that supports you by giving you access to market, finance, and capacity building. We are able to empower the MSME to gradually become pan African business partners leveraging technology.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, LCCI President, Mrs Toki Mabogunje said the webinar is to explore the opportunities and challenges of economic integration for stakeholders and for ECOWAS member states, adding that the forum also serves to examine the various trade policies, intra-regional commerce, smooth integration between member states and potential markets with borderless opportunities. She said LCCI will continue to partner with ECOWAS institutions to realise its objective of wealth creation, economic integration and commitment to peace and development.\n\nSpecial Guest of Honour, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo lauded the efforts of ECOWAS in boosting trade in the sub-region. He was optimistic that collaboration with the organized private sector would further boost commerce and the economy of member states",

Furthermore, the Joint National Public Service Negotiating Council, the umbrella bodyof the Unions in the Public Service in its meetings over the past six years have continued to bring to the fore some of the challenges encountered by its members as a result of the implementation of the Act.\n\n\u201cWe have also received submissions from the Contributory Pensions Union of Nigeria, while a number of officers had also echoed the need for the review of the PRA 2014 to enhance the welfare of officers.\n\n\u201cThus, the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has identified the review of the Pension Reform Act, 2014 as a major assignment which must be approached headlong and with every sense of responsibility,\u201d she stated.",

I cannot categorically confirm to the World the present state of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, as at today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is to be pointed out that Our Client is presently detained in DSS facility pursuant to an Order of Court, and another Order made by the same Court directing Our access to our Client on specified days, is unfortunately being flouted by the officials of the State Security Services, as they have no reason or justification of any kind to refuse us access.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will formally communicate the Court first thing tomorrow morning on this unfortunate and strange development, and shall keep the World updated.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould anything untoward happen to Our Client, the Nigerian Government and the Department of State Security Services should be held responsible.

          "text": "The Nigeria Police Force Thursday night acknowledged receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against DCP Abba Kyari, juts as the the Inspector General of Police IGP Usman Baba has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\nA press statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), CP Frank Mba, Thursday in Abuja, said: \u201cThe Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cFurther developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\nA US court had issued warrant of arrest on a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, over his alleged links to suspected fraudster, Ramon Abbas popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nA spokesperson in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed that the warrant was issued by U.S Magistrate Judge, Otis Wright.\n\nKyari had arrested and jailed one Chibuzo Vincent, an estranged co-conspirator in a $1.1million fraud case at the behest of Hushpuppi.\n\nThe deputy commissioner also allegedly sent a bank account to Hushpuppi reportedly for the payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nHowever, the senior police officer Mr Kyari, in a Facebook post, Thursday, has since denied the allegations.\n\nHushpuppi, who had pleaded guilty to the multi-million dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government, risks 20 years in prison.\n\nHe reportedly explained how the proceeds from the crime were spent leading to the indictment of DCP Kyari.\n\nAccording to the indictment, \u201cAbbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. Morayo, 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. Bolamide, 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22, 2021, by FBI agents.\n\n\u201cApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand-delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts.\n\n\u201cOther illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\n\u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\n\u201cKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d the US court document read in part.\n\nIn a swift reaction, DCP Kyari said he did not demand any money from Hushpuppi. He, however, said he introduced the accused to a cloth seller whom Hushpuppi paid about N300,000.\n\nThe Facebook post read in part: \u201cFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about two years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life and they were long time friends who had money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nKyari further stated that, \u201cFor those who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious big money they will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of service for two decades is open for everybody to see.\n\n\u201cThey will continue seeing us serving our father land and we will continue responding to all distress calls from all Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\u201d",

          "text": "A US court has ordered the arrest of a celebrated Nigerian cop, Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari, court documents have shown.\n\nThe records show that Otis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to track down Kyari and produce him in the United States for his role in a multi-million dollar fraud executed by Nigerian cyber fraudster Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi.\n\nAbbas was arrested in the UAE in June 2020 alongside 11 of his associates over allegations bordering on hacking, impersonation, scamming, banking fraud, and identity theft.\n\nHe had pled guilty to fraud in the US this week and according to the FBI, Messrs. Abbas and Kyari were buddies and were both involved in a money-laundering scheme.\n\nKyari was also charged with accepting money from Abbas in exchange for the arrest of \u201cone of his rivals in Nigeria after a dispute over a $1.1 million scam on Qatari businesspeople\u201d.\n\nSome reports suggest American prosecutors first filed a court warrant to arrest Kyari on February 12, 2021, while a new warrant for his arrest was issued on April 29, 2021.\n\nOn July 26, Judge Wright\u2019s order allowing the FBI to arrest Kyari and hold him in US custody was made public.\n\nKyari, a respected police officer has since denied receiving money from Hushpuppi. Reacting on Thursday, Kyari said he never demanded money from Hushpuppi, insisting \u201cmy hands are clean\u201d.\n\nAlthough he admitted to knowing about the money-related dispute, Kyari disclosed that it was on the basis of the call that Vincent was arrested.\n\nThe Nigerian cop wrote on Instagram, \u201cAbbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2years ago that somebody in Nigeria Seriously threatened to kill his Family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s Phone number and pleaded we take action before the Person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the Suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life And they are long-time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the Suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my Native Clothes and Caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The Native Clothes and Caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and He sent somebody to Collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the Suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\n\n\u201cFor those who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious Big Money, They will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of Service for 2 decades is open for everybody to See. They will continue seeing us serving our fatherland and we will Continue responding to ALL distress Calls from ALL Nigerians provided they are life-threatening.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

Their value is just too volatile and unrelated to the real economy.\n\n\u201cEven in relatively less stable economies, the use of a globally recognised reserve currency such as the dollar or euro would likely be more alluring than adopting a crypto asset.\u201d\n\nThe IMF added that digital currencies had the potential to provide cheaper and faster payments, enhance financial inclusion, improve resilience and competition among payment providers, and facilitate cross-border transfer but nations need to proceed with caution.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
