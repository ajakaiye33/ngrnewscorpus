          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nAn eye care specialist, Dr. Chinedu Njezi, has cautioned Nigerians seeking free cataract surgeries to be wary of where they access such services.\n\nAccording to the optometrist, people seeking free cataract surgery could end up in the hands of quacks if they are not cautious about who is offering the services.\n\nNjezi, who is the medical director of Sight Haven Eye Clinic, said the danger in patronising quacks for cataract surgery, especially when it is free, is that such untrained persons could conduct the surgical procedure using an outdated method called couching.\n\nSome organisations, he said, use the archaic couching treatment for cataracts.\n\n\u201cQuacks can do anything in remote areas where monitoring is difficult.\n\n\u201cSome quacks can use the ancient practice called couching to remove cataracts,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to healio.com \u2013 a medical site \u2013 couching involves using a sharp instrument, such as a thorn or needle, to pierce the eye at the limbus. The opaque lens would then be dislocated from the central visual axis and pushed down into the vitreous cavity through the pars plana.\n\nThe cataract will thus remain in the eye but would no longer be blocking light, therefore, producing an instantaneous improvement in vision\n\nNjezi, who is also the public relations officer of the Nigerian Optometric Association, Abuja chapter, stressed that couching is now highly prohibited because of the new advancements in the medical world.\n\nMore sophisticated methods available for removing cataracts that people should use, Njezi said, are laser surgeries, phacoemulsification and small incision cataract surgeries.\n\nCouching, he noted, can lead to more severe complications.\n\nThe optometrist added that couching is a crude method and can lead to secondary glaucoma which in turn can lead to blindness.\n\nNjezi also added that \u201ccouching can also lead to capsule rupture when or if performed by untrained personnel or quacks.\n\n\u201cIt can lead to endopthalmitis and then panopthalmitis \u2013 a condition of secondary infection from the internal structures of the eye to the outer cornea and sclera.\n\n\u201cThis will mean the eye globe has to be removed to preserve the life of the patient.\u201d\n\nThe optometrist advised patients to be watchful and careful of who is organising the cataract surgery outreach or cam, adding that patients should exercise their bill of rights that empower them to ask medical personnel any question about their qualification qualifications and the patient\u2019s expected surgical outcomes.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the optometrist said, \u201cThe problem with free medical outreaches and surgical interventions is the inability to know if the surgeon is a licensed ophthalmologist or a quack.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason we mostly advise people to go to the hospital and if free surgeries must be an option, then know the address of the organisation sponsoring it and know where to go for after surgical care\u201d.\n\nAnother reason, he said, is to ensure there is a follow-up measure in place after the surgery.\n\n\u201cFollow-ups usually tell the doctor or the surgeon in this case if there is a post-surgical infection, or if proper post-surgical advice were taken and what to do.\n\n\u201cSo, most times after the free cataract surgery, a worse condition can occur like panopthalmitis or uveitis which may lead to the removal of the eyeball in the worst-case scenarios,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u201cWe, the coalition of youth associations in the nine constituent states of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), call on the President, President Muhammadu Buhari, to inaugurate the Senate-confirmed Governing Board of the Commission following the completion of the forensic audit as has been confirmed by the Minister of Niger Delta.\n\nWhile receiving some members of the forensic audit team in his office on Monday, August 9, 2021, Senator Akpabio confirmed that the Forensic audit of the NDDC, on which account the Board nominated by Mr President and confirmed by the Senate on November 5, 2019, was put on hold, has been concluded and the report of the forensic audit was now ready to be submitted to President Buhari.\n\nWith the completion of the audit, therefore, we urge Mr. President to put in place the Governing Board to ensure accountability, equitable representation and rapid development of the NDDC states.\n\nWe recall that on the 24th day of June 2021, while receiving the Ijaw National Congress at the State House in Abuja, President Buhari promised that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted. The President said: \u201cBased on the mismanagement that had previously bedevilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated\u201d\n\nIt is against this background that our Coalition of Youths Associations from the nine constituent states of the NDDC align with the demands of Niger Delta Governors, ethnic nationalities, statesmen and civil society organisations who have been calling for the inauguration of the Governing Board, since 2019, in compliance with the NDDC Act and to ensure full representation of the constituent states.\n\nWe wish to caution that any further delay in inaugurating the Board of NDDC will unecessarily aggravate the heightened tension in the entire Niger Delta region, which unfortunately is inimical to the peace so far enjoyed in the region which lays the golden eggs that sustain the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nWe call on Mr President to follow through on his promise and inaugurate the Board that he appointed for the Commission. Since the inauguration of the Board was put on hold in November 2019, the NDDC has been run by Interim Managements and a sole administrator who have been utilising the funds of the Commission without any significant development projects commissioned in the Constituent states in the last two years. Our people have suffered untold neglect from the absence of representation in management. The NDDC Act provides for a Board that has membership from all the nine constituent states, which is what Mr President followed in nominating the Board now awaiting inauguration.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in a letter personally signed by him and dated October 18th, 2019 sent the names of nominees for the NDDC Board to the Senate. The members were vetted by all relevant agencies of the federal government following which they were screened and confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019. Mr President asked that the inauguration of the Board should be put on hold pending the completion of the forensic audit, for which an Interim Management Committee was appointed for the NDDC. The Federal Government announced during the inauguration ceremony of the IMC that the Senate-Confirmed NDDC Board will be inaugurated after the forensic audit.\n\nOur people can no longer endure a prolonged wait before the Board takes over as our region has been yearning for the impact of the NDDC these past years. We therefore urge Mr President to speedily inaugurate the NDDC Board to ensure fair representation of the nine constituent states, accountability in the utilisation of the NDDC funds, checks and balances and due process in the Commission in compliance with the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nSigned: National President, Tamunopriye Alaibo and General Secretary, Okon Udo Archibong and Publicity Secretary, Uche Onyema on behalf of Niger Delta Youth Coalition",

The judiciary has played a huge role in giving power to the wrong people even when they know it but the love of money has made injustice surround the country.\n\n\u201cDue to the injustice in the land, things happening in Nigeria at the moment are expected because God isn\u2019t always happy with such nations. In Nigeria, if we don\u2019t stop the politics of money, we will not get the right leaders who will take us seriously, Nigeria will continue to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cFor example, Imo state is a case study for the corrupt practices in the judiciary system. The current governor, Hope Uzodinma came fourth in the governorship election but because of the politics of money, the judiciary system found a way to declare him winner of the election, we all can see how Imo state has become ungovernable for the governor as a result of insurgents, killings, attacks and other social vices\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Imo north senatorial district, the judiciary system declared Frank Ibezim as the winner of the bye election that took place in December 2020 whereas, it has been confirmed that he has discrepancies in his certificate. The ruling party had no candidate for the election and the candidate of the PDP, Emmanuel Okewulonu should be declared winner but the judiciary failed because of the politics of money\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians and the judiciary system need to desist from this act of politics of money if we want the country to move forward or else, we will keep experiencing hardship.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Itua, Abuja and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nMembers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Working Committee (NWC) have clashed over the legality of a meeting where six members called for the immediate resignation of the National Chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the nine NWC members led by the deputy national chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif, met at Hilton Hotel, Abuja, on Sunday night over the crisis in the party.\n\nThere are 19 NWC members, comprising 12 national officers, and six national vice chairmen in charge of the six geo-political zones.\n\nHowever, the PDP National Legal Adviser, Emmanuel Enoidem, described the meeting as a nullity as it is only the national chairman or two-third of NWC members that can convene a meeting of the party organ.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, six of the NWC members including Nazif; Mai Adamu Mustapher, National Auditor; Sunday Udeh- Okoye; Taofiq Arapaja, national vice chairman (South West); Chief Dan Orbih, national vice chairman (South South) and Chief Ali Odefa, national vice chairman (South East) called for Secondus\u2019 immediate resignation.\n\nOthers who attended the meeting were Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri, national secretary; Abdulahi Maibasira, national financial secretary and Chief Theophilus Dakas, national vice chairman (North Central).\n\nThe aggrieved NWC members resolved to forward their resolution to the PDP Governors Forum, the BoT and other organs of the party.\n\nRegardless, Secondus, in a statement by his media adviser, , Ike Abonyi, insisted that he would not resign as has done nothing wrong to warrant it.\n\nThe PDP chairman challenged \u201ctiny minority\u201d calling for his resignation to come clean and tell party stalwarts the main reason they want him out of office.\n\nEnoidem, in a WhatsApp message shared to some members of the NWC, noted that \u201cby Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.\n\nSubsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\u201d\n\nHe contended that \u201cas a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of NWC summoned by the national chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of resignation of any officer of our party at any level is a personal decision as stipulated in Sections 45(1) & 47 (5).\n\n\u201cThere is no provision of our constitution which donates powers to any organ, individuals or group of persons to ask an officer of the party to resign for any reason whatsoever as was purported in the so called press release.\n\n\u201cThe powers to remove any member of the NWC and indeed any national officer is reserved in the national convention which is due for December 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is more so when the purported meeting was said to have been convened on Sunday August 8, 2021 against the widely published position taken by the BoT advising members and leaders of our party to maintain peace until a committee set up has deliberated on the raging controversies.\u201d\n\nThis came as some support groups under the platform of Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups lent their voice to call for Secondus to resign.\n\nDuring a protest at the party\u2019s National secretariat in Abuja, the Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups accused Secondus of polarising the party for his own selfish interest while also alleging that he was responsible for the defection of three governors and some senators from the party to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nIts leader, Tamunotonye Inioribo, who addressed the media, alleged that no department of the PDP was functioning under Secondus, and he was also creating factions within state branches of the party.\n\nThe protesters were seen carrying placards with different inscriptions such \u201cSecondus Must Go\u201d, \u201cwe have lost confidence in your chairmanship\u201d, \u201cwe cannot afford to lose more governors\u201d, among others.\n\nThe party organs, including the NWC, Board of Trustees and others, have activated conflict resolution mechanisms to wade into the crisis ahead of the party\u2019s National Elective Convention, expected to hold in December.\n\nThis is as members of the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives have disagreed over calls for the resignation the party\u2019s national chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nThe PDP caucus, in the House, in a statement by Kingsley Chinda and Chukwuka Onyema, leader and deputy leader, respectively, on Sunday night, called on Secondus to resign immediate in the interest of the opposition party.\n\nHowever, the minority leader, House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said he has no knowledge of any meeting by the PDP caucus, where decision was taken to call for the resignation of Secondus.\n\nElumelu, in a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cIf such a meeting held, it was without the knowledge of the leadership of the Minority Caucus, and therefore in breach of established procedure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working in concert with organs of the party to ensure sustainable resolution of the current challenges that will be in the overall interest of the party and Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThis came as former governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, opposed plans to force him out.\n\nDickson who represents Bayelsa West, in a statement he personally signed, said the decision of a few members of the party to force Secondus out did not represent their views.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, only the national chairman of the party can summon and preside over meetings of the organs of the party especially the NWC of which he is chairman. So, the purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: 3 members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee. By the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement leaving out the majority of 13 who were not at the meeting and the chairman who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crises in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "No fewer than six persons were reportedly killed in separate incidents as the sit-at-home directive by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) took a bloody turn in Nkwogu, Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area of Abia and Nnewi, Nnewi North Local Government Area of Anambra State, yesterday.\n\nFollowing abduction of Nnamdi Kanu in Kenya by security agents in collaboration with Nigeria government and rearraignment in a Federal High Court in Abuja for continuation of his trial by the Department of State Services (DSS), the pro-Biafran group declared sit-at-home for every Monday until his release.\n\nIn Abia, the exercise witnessed the setting ablaze of three passengers in a transport company vehicle while the driver was shot by gunmen.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Michael Abattam, said the incident was under investigation.\n\nIn Nnewi, eyewitnesses said they heard gun shots at Izuchukwu Junction as early as 6am and found bodies of two young men. But nobody could explain who shot them.\n\nSources said one of them was suspected to be a leader of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), and the other, a commercial motorcyclist in the area.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, said he did not have details: \u201cYes, something happened in Nnewi but the information is still sketchy. There is a little bonfire on the road but the police have removed them. We are still monitoring the situation. Police presence is everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe sit-at-home order witnessed partial compliance in Imo State as most shops and other public places were initially under lock and key in the early hours of 7 and 8 am. But someshops later opened for business.\n\nAt Orlu, believed to be the epicentre of crisis in recent times, roads such Banana junction, Okporo among others were deserted and shops closed. Except for vehicles of security operatives patrolling the roads, the roads were deserted. All banks were also shut.\n\nAt the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, three airlines had touched down at press time but the passengers remain stranded as there were no airport taxis or commercial motorcycles to take them to their various destinations. The roads leading to the airport were a shadow even as vendors selling around the airport did not turn up for business. The popular Douglas road where the Eke-Ukwu Owerri is located was partially open for business.\n\nIn Anambra, the order was largely observed in Awka, the state capital as banks, markets including the popular Eke Awka, filling stations and others were closed while most roads were deserted.\n\nAlthough security personnel were sighted in some locations, most people stayed indoors either in obedience or out of fear of the unknown.\n\nIn Onitsha, markets, banks, filling stations and other business premises were closed. It was also the same in Ekwulobia and other urban centres in the state.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Tochukwu, told Daily Sun that the police provided adequate security to enable people go about their lawful businesses without fear.\n\n\u201cOur patrol vehicles are everywhere. Shops are a little bit open. Some that did not open were sitting in front of their shops. But our men are still patrolling around the cities.\u201d\n\n\u2022Masked men invade Enugu communities\n\nIn parts of Enugu-Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area, scores were injured, robbed and valuables destroyed as masked men on motorcycles invaded Ogrute, headquarters of Igbo-Eze North LGA smashed tables, looted shops and injured anyone on sight.\n\nAt Nkwo Aji community being a market day, the masked men descended on traders who came earlier to display their wares and attacked everyone with various weapons.\n\nPeople of the area who normally sell palmwine were counting losses as suspected IPOB members descended on the palm wine tappers/ sellers at their section smashed gallons of palm wine and beat up sellers as everyone ran for safety.\n\nAt the old Nkwo market, they also attacked a patent medicine store, broke the sliding glass shielding and scattered various drugs. A muslim faithful residing in the area popularly known as Momoh was also attacked as they damaged his motorcycle.\n\nThere were also reports of attack on hapless residents and shop owners in Isiugwu, Okpo, Imufu and Onicha-Enugu communities in the area.\n\nA businessman in Ogrute was also attacked in his farm at Imufu where they beat up the wife, struck the man with iron rod and collected the cash on him.\n\nTraders at the Nkwo Aji market were helpless as the market was deserted while those who normally come to purchase or sell perishable goods on the Nkwo market day were stranded.\n\n\u2022Abia, Nsukka grounded\n\nEconomic and social activities were paralyzed in Enugu as the entire Coal City witnessed the crippling of government and private businesses as civil servants (both federal and state) and public servants shun offices just as markets, banks, fuel stations, motor parks and even eateries did not open for business.\n\nSchools in the state were not left out as some of them, especially private ones, sent SMS to parents and guardians not to bring their children and wards to schools.\n\nNot even the confusion in the discordant voices in IPOB were able to avert the lockdown, as people who thought it would not work and came out early were disappointed as they waited in vain for vehicles, while those who drove returned when it was obvious they were the only people on the road.\n\nThe situation also affected the media as newspapers vanished from known newsstands. At the popular Obiagu where newspapers are sold, everywhere were deserted and children turned the streets to football field.\n\nA fruit seller who opened shop around 10am around Agric Bank bus stop said he did because his goods are perishables but noted that he was yet to make any sale by noon.\n\nA motorist, John Agu said: \u201cWe are happy that we are observing it. Though we did not go to work, it is still good because the Federal Government should know that we the Easterners are not happy at all. They should release our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, because he has not done anything wrong to deserve this insults he is getting from them.\u201d\n\nIn Aba, Abia State residents kept indoors and left their shops and business houses under lock and key. Streets and major access roads in the city centre, including the ever busy Milverton Avenue luxury/mini bus terminals for long distant travels were all deserted. Banks and markets such as Ekeoha Market (Shopping Centre), Ariaria international Market, Ahia Ohuru (Ngwa Road Market), Cemetery/Eziukwu Road Market, and others were shut down.\n\nHowever, no security agent was seen in all the locations our Correspondent visited, though they were on duty in their barracks and stations.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, an Aba resident, Mr Nnanna Ezeonyia, said he returned from a journey to hear there would be a sit-at-home but thought it would not be effective, but only came into the town to see that every where was deserted and looked like a ghost town.\n\nHe commended Igbo for bonding in one spirit in their quest for a better placement in Nigeria or the opportunity for a country of their own.\n\nEconomic activities were also paralysed in the university town of Nsukka and its environ.Banks closed their banking halls but allowed customers to use their Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) to withdrawals.\n\nIn major motor parks, passengers who wanted to travel to different locations like Abuja, Owerri, Anambra were stranded as drivers refused sell tickets or load their buses. Also, major markets like Nsukka Main Market, Building Material Market and Ikpa Commodity Market were all under lock and key\n\nA passenger who identified himself as Patricia Eze said she was traveling to Gwagwarada in Abuja but was stranded.\n\nHowever, government establishments like University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nsukka council secretariat, some primary and secondary schools were opened.\n\nThe ever-busy Enugu Road Nsukka by Nsukka known for traffic gridlock witnessed free with scanty flow of vehicular and human movement.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, Nsukka town and its environ remained calm and peaceful as there were no reports of harassment or violence.\n\n\u2022Partial complaince in Asaba, Ebonyi, Aba\n\nThe exercise recorded partial compliance in Ebonyi and Asaba, Delta State capital.\n\nAreas where t was observed in the Delta State capital included Okwe, Akwebulu and Oko, where commercial activities were halted in the morning hours. The areas are considered as IPOB base in the capital city.\n\nIt also affected travelers to Onitsha in Anambra State, as commercial buses were not available on the road.\n\nSecurity personnel were also seen around major roads to forestall break down of peace and order.\n\nIn Abakaliki, all the transport companies located along Afikpo road opened for businesses but there were no passengers.\n\nSome parks including popular Ishieke park located along Water Works road in the metropolis were opened when Daily Sun visited the park. However, commercial banks loacted at Ogoja road and Afikpo road did not open but their Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were dispensing cash.\n\nAlso, some shops opened for businesses in the capital city with free human and vehicular movements though not as it used to be on a normal day. Many filling stations in the capital city did not open.\n\nHowever, workers defied the sit-at-home order as they were seen in their offices at Ochudo Centenary City Secretariat and the old government House.\n\nHowever, in the Abia state capital, Umuahia, there was partial compliance to the order.\n\nAlthough banks and schools did not open, gates of markets in Umuahia were opened and people moved about their businesses freely while commercial bus drivers and tricycle operators plied the streets of the city without hindrance.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.\n\nGovernment offices were opened as workers went to work in obedience to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu\u2019s directive.",

          "text": "\u2022It\u2019s the only way to remove him, Dickson insists\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll not resign, says party chair\n\n\u2022Senate, House caucuses support peace moves\n\n\u2022Party commences online membership registration\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAfter meeting for over 40 minutes behind closed doors on Monday, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors and the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, appeared to have reached a new deal as part of efforts to resolve the crisis which engulfed its leadership and ensure lasting peace in the main opposition party. The deal involved consideration of an early date for the party\u2019s national convention, as against the initial date of December 9.\n\nWith the new deal, widely believed to be in the overall interest of the party, THISDAY gathered that the December convention might be brought forward to either October or November.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in an earlier statement from his media office, said he would not succumb to pressure to resign. \u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign,\u201d he was quoted as saying. He added that he remained focused in his determination to move the party forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday, supported the move by the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) to resolve the crisis in the party. Abaribe and Elumelu denied reports that PDP members in the House had passed a resolution that Secondus should resign. The clarification was in reaction to a statement by a House of Representatives member from Rivers State, Kingsley Chinda, asking the party chairman to resign.\n\nOn his part, a former governor of Bayelsa State and member of the upper chamber, Senator Seriake Dickson, faulted calls for Secondus to resign, saying only the national convention is empowered to remove him.\n\nThe PDP governors had met for over seven hours between 10am and 5pm at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge. But about 4.10pm, Secondus was invited to the meeting, which held till 4.50pm\n\nAfter meeting with the PDP governors, Secondus was seen off by the governors of Sokoto and Akwa Ibom states, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Udom Emmanuel, respectively.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign\u201d, Secondus told reporters as he made to leave the venue.\n\nAlthough a deal to bring the convention backward had been struck, it was not clear if it included the eligibility of Secondus to contest. But the details of the deal\u2019s implementation would depend on the governors\u2019 meeting today with a committee set up by the BoT to interface.\n\nTambuwal told newsmen that the governors had resolved to back the party in its march towards greater unification.\n\nTambuwal, who is Chairman, PDP Governors Forum, said, \u201cWe have resolved to work together as a forum on the side of our party and the meeting continues tomorrow.\u201d He added, \u201cVery soon, Nigerians will know that our party is united.\u201d\n\nThe Monday meeting, held at the Akwa Ibom Liaison Office in Asokoro, Abuja, was attended by all the PDP governors, with the exception of Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.\n\nBefore the forum adjourned, Secondus, who made a brief appearance, said he would not resign from his position.\n\nA short statement from his media office, signed by Ike Abonye, said nothing so far warranted his resignation from the party\u2019s highest position. It said a tiny minority calling for the national chairman\u2019s resignation should come clean and tell other members his offence and why he should resign. Secondus promised to remain focussed and committed to the ideals of the party, which he swore to protect and defend upon his election as chairman 44 months ago.\n\nElumelu, who spoke on behalf of the House caucus said, in a statement, \u201cThe attention of the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has been drawn to false and misleading publications, purporting that the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives met online and resolved that the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, should resign.\n\n\u201cThe publication is, indeed, embarrassing to PDP lawmakers in the House of Representatives, as no such meeting took place. For the avoidance of doubt, no online meeting or any meeting in any form whatsoever of PDP members in the House of Representatives was held, to discuss, let alone arrive at any decision regarding the national chairman or any issue related to the disagreements in the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur caucus in the House of Representatives is fully aligned with the intervention and decisions of the Board of Trustees (BoT), the elders and leaders of our party, in finding solutions to the leadership challenges confronting our great party and we await the outcome of their intervention.\n\n\u201cWhile we caution those behind this false and misleading publication to retrace their steps and desist from such, we also urge our party leaders, critical stakeholders, PDP members, teeming supporters, and the general public to completely disregard the said publication.\n\n\u201cWe call on all PDP members to remain calm and focused as the elders and leaders of the party will come out with solutions at this critical time.\u201d\n\nSupporting the House caucus position, their counterparts in the Senate also backed the steps taken by the BoT to resolve the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe Senate PDP Caucus, on Monday, stated that it was in full support of whatever steps being taken by the party\u2019s BoT to resolve the issues at stake.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader, who doubles as Chairman of the PDP Senate Caucus, Abaribe, told THISDAY that though the PDP senators were on annual vacation, they backed the current move by the BoT to restore peace and sanity to the opposition party.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cWe are on vacation and support the BoT effort at getting a solution.\u201d\n\nChinda and Deputy Leader, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, had made their online resolution available to journalists yesterday, after they deliberated extensively but specifically on the current charge of \u201cinept leadership\u201d against Secondus.\n\nThey noted that while PDP and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipated vigorous and well-coordinated issue-based national opposition, preparations towards a national convention as well as the 2023 general election, confusion, finger-pointing and needless noise around the party\u2019s national headquarters had complicated the noble objectives and lofty ideals of the PDP and democratic opposition politics in Nigeria.\n\nThey alleged that Secondus seemed content with occupying the office and preoccupied with holding on to his position rather than preparing for the next elections. This, they claimed, explained why Secondus inexplicably continued to miss endless opportunities that ought to have been utilised for consolidating a viable opposition, skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition, and frustrating genuine party members across states, which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\nChinda and Onyema lamented that there was no clear roadmap, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the chairman, thus, the party was allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\nThey expressed concern that a further three months under the leadership of Secondus could do grave harm to the party and put its members in a precarious situation.\n\nThey, therefore, urged Secondus \u201cto consider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\nYesterday also, an unsigned statement by some PDP National Working Committee (NWC) members said, \u201cSequel to the meeting held on the 3rd of August 2021, at Legacy House, where members of the National Working Committee (NWC) sat and decided that a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) should be held on the 8th of August 2021 at Hilton to further deliberate on the matter bedevilling the party, the meeting held and extensively deliberated, nine members of the National Working Committee (NWC) agreed that the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\n\n\u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, six members voted that he should resign and three members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors forum, the BoT, the National Assembly caucus of both House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe call on all members of the party to remain calm as the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif; National Secretary, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha; National Financial Secretary, Abdulahi Maibasira; National Youth Leader, Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye; National Vice Chairman (SW), Taofiq Arapaja; National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa; National Vice Chairman (SS), Chief Dan Osi Orbih and National vice chairman (NC), Chief Theophilus Dakas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said those who voted for the resignation of Secondus were Nazif, Adamu Udeh-Okoye, Arapaja, Orbih and Odefa.\n\nBut National Legal Adviser of PDP, Emmanuel Enoidem, disclaimed the meeting of the said members of the NWC, describing it as illegal.\n\nIn a statement, Enoidem said, \u201cI just saw the above somewhere and as a committed member of this party and by the special grace of God, a member of NWC, I have the following points to make.\n\n\u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.Subsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of the NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\u201d\n\nEnoidem maintained that the power to remove any member of the NWC and, indeed, any national officer was reserved for the national convention, which was earlier slated for December 2021.\n\nSpeaking, too, Dickson, in a release issued on Monday, flayed the purported meeting by some members of the party\u2019s NWC, whom he said went outside the constitution of the party to convene a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the national chairman. He drew the attention of PDP leaders, members as well as Nigerians to the fact that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and did not represent a valid resolution or decision of the NWC known to the PDP constitution.\n\nDickson stated, \u201cThe purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP. It is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: three members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement, leaving out the majority of 13, who were not at the meeting and the chairman, who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore, it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crisis in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nWhile puncturing a purported statement by the PDP caucus in the House, which asked Secondus to resign, Dickson said, \u201cAll this is to create a media frenzy backed up with the sponsored demonstrations at the party secretariat on Monday, which are designed to force the chairman to resign in order to set up a caretaker committee, which is illegal.\n\n\u201cHappily, the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has issued a statement a short while ago that he will not resign. I support this decision fully as it is backed by the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, a vote of no confidence even by a duly constituted NWC or other organs of the party does not remove a Chairman. The chairman is voted for and can only be removed by the National Convention unless on his own volition, he chooses to resign.\u201d\n\nParty Commences Membership Registration\n\nMeanwhile, PDP has commenced online membership registration and revalidation in soe states. The states piloting the initiative in the first phase of the programme are Anambra, Osun, Ekiti, Edo, Adamawa, and Sokoto.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abuja while launching the project, Secondus stated that the \u201ccountry must at this point in time migrate from analogue to digital.\n\n\u201cData is the key to development; data is the key to proper planning and data is the way a country would be able to attract development from the global community. We as a party cannot do otherwise. We are operating in social media space, so, PDP cannot do without data.\u201d\n\nSecondus explained that by offering online registration, the party was providing Nigerians with a transparent platform to harness their democratic potential.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe project will deepen the process of membership registration and also deepen the process of democracy in attracting development. Usually, in the analogue time, they have to bring the register and if they don\u2019t like your face, you will not be a member. Some people will take the register away. All that has been eliminated.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the e-registration was a demonstration of PDP\u2019s readiness for the 2023 general election. Jibrin assured members that the crisis rocking the party would soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe have spent so many sleepless nights in ensuring that we resolved the crisis within our party in order to make PDP great again and also take advantage of the failures of the APC,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, revealed that when the logo of the party was put online during the test-running period, in less than 24 hours, over one million Nigerians indicated interest to join the party.\n\nNational Organising Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu (rtd), also said intensified sensitisation had commenced in order to create awareness on the e-registration programme down to the ward level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said its proposed digital currency, known as e-Naira, will be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nIn a document obtained by THISDAY, which offered more insights into the digital money regime, especially the potential risks and mitigation measures, the apex bank said there would be a co-existence of traditional payment systems and the CBN Digital Currency (CBDC) to address interoperability risks that might be associated with the implementation.\n\nCBN said it would apply regulatory framework and compliance mechanisms to prevent disruptive competition for the electronic money.\n\nOn the associated cost and risk of deploying/on-boarding a new payment platform, the bank explained that medium to long- term pay-off in increased efficiency of operations was expected to offset initial outlay. It added that any risk of disintermediation would be addressed by the introduction of limits on the e-Naira holdings.\n\nThe document further stated that the introduction of the CBDC would, among other things, usher in new approaches to payment as well as bring about new bank and non- bank players in the financial system.\n\nThe digital currency regime would also introduce a new range of banking services and integration with new systems, providing new possibilities for the payment architecture.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the two-tiered model for CBDC would facilitate a public-private partnership arrangement whereby the CBN would design the e-Naira and distribute through regulated financial institutions, while the latter would in turn provide the digital cash to individuals and businesses.\n\nEssentially, under the e-Naira regime, individuals and businesses would be able to transfer value in real time through existing and future payment channels. People would also be able to transfer value in real time while offline to other persons and businesses.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the e-Naira would lower the cost of operations and cash management as well as improve visibility and insight of transaction date for financial institutions. It would also improve opportunities in the financial system, creating new business opportunities from emerging business models, financial products, and services.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele had during the recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting provided additional clarification on the e-Naira project. Emefiele said if \u201cyou have some naira in your account and you choose to convert part of your naira into a digital wallet by way of a digital currency, we will support that.\n\n\u201cIf, for instance, you have N10 million in your account. Of course, when this starts, the CBN will move some of the balances of banks with CBN to those banks in digital currency. So, you go to your bank, you have N10 million and you say you want to convert N2 million out of your N10 million into a digital currency. They will debit your account and move it to your wallet of N2 million digital currency, which you can spend across countries.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe think that this is a noble idea and we are not the first\u2026many other central banks are at advanced stages of revealing their own digital currencies. And our own digital currency, which is tagged e-Naira, will certainly come into operation, by the special grace of God, by October and we are working very hard for this.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said, \u201cWe believe that transactions will be cheaper and more efficient, as there will be less to complete.\u201d\n\nHe said as Nigeria moved to the digital economy, like the rest of the world, cash would not play in that space.\n\n\u201cTherefore, e-Naira, which will represent the digital equivalent of cash, will be used as the fiat currency to effect transactions,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of financial inclusion, we believe that with over 30 per cent of bankable adults still outside the financial system, the ability to have offline payment through our e-Naira initiative will bring\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rivers Govt, Not FG Should Collect VAT, Related Taxes, Court Rules",
          "text": "By Blessing Ibunge\n\nIn a landmark ruling, the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has declared that the Rivers State Government and not the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), an agency of the federal government, should collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in the state.\n\nPresided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam, the court also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the FIRS and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nJustice Pam made the assertion while delivering judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there was no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the federal government was limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains, which did not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lackedjurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nJustice Pam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the state government were issues of law that the court was constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it was entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it was the State and not FIRS that was constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the federal government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants were not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nAmong the reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, was a declaration that the constitutional power of the federal government to impose taxes and duties was only limited to the items listed in items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the second schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had also urged the court to declare that, by virtue of the provisions of items 7 and 8 of the Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule of the constitution, the power of the federal government to delegate the collection of taxes can only be exercised by the State government or other authority of the state and no other person.\n\nThe State government had further asked the court to declare that all statutory provisions made or purportedly made in the exercise of the legislative powers of the federal government, which contained provisions that were inconsistent with or in excess of the powers to impose tax and duties, as prescribed by items 58 and 59 of the Part I of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution, or inconsistent with the power to delegate the duty of collection of taxes, as contained in items 7 and 8 of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Constitution, were unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nLead counsel for the Rivers State Government, Donald Chika Denwigwe (SAN), who spoke to journalists after the court session, explained that the case was all about the interpretation of the constitution as regards the authority of the government at the state and federal levels to collect certain revenue particularly, VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, during the determination of the matter, some issues of law were thrown up like, whether or not the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the determination of some issues.\n\n\u201cThe court noted that the application is like asking the Federal High Court to transfer the entire case to the Court of Appeal. In which case, if the court so decides, there will be nothing left to refer back to the Federal High Court as required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nAccording to Denwigwe, the court refused that prayer and decided that the case was in its proper place before the Federal High Court and to determine it.\n\nDonald Chika Denwigwe, SAN, lead counsel to Government of Rivers State and Ken C.O. Njemanze, SAN, briefing journalists after the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt on Monday declared FIRS collection of Value Added Tax in Rivers State unconstitutional.\n\nOn the implication of the judgement, Denwigwe said it was now, unlawful for such taxes as VAT in Rivers State to be collected by any agency of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIn a summary, it is a determination that it is wrong for the federal government to be collecting taxes, which are constitutionally reserved for the state governments to collect. The implication of the judgement is that the government (federal and state) as an authority under the constitution, should be advised by the judgement, that it is the duty of all government authorities to comply with and obey the law so long as the court has interpreted it and said what that law is.\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the issue of Value Added Tax (VAT) in the territory of Rivers State and Personal Income Tax should be reserved for the government of Rivers State.\u201d\n\nCounsel to FIRS, O.C. Eyibo said he would study the judgment and advise his client.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Even though his associates are doing everything to cover up the scandal, we believe President Muhammad Buhari won\u2019t interfere and ensure proper probe of the scandal in line with his claims of zero tolerance for corruption,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Monday exclusively reported how spirited efforts by the governor and his backers to cover up the scandal failed last week when his pre-tenure form (form CC81) which was deposited at CCB on May 23, 2019 got leaked to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Department of State Security Services and the National Intelligence Agency.\n\n\u201cThough he has immunity but he committed offences contrary to Section 15 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 which are punishable under Section 23 (2) of the same Act,\u201d a government house source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nAn analysis of the document submitted by the governor showed that He declared having N2billion as cash in six Nigerian banks.\n\nFurther checks showed that the accounts are being operated by one firm, MDG construction and general company limited.\n\nBuni, in the document, however, claimed to have no cash in foreign accounts.\n\nDespite claiming his two main source of income were farming and business, a closer look at the document revealed that the governor declared 25 buildings in Abuja, Kano and Yobe states valued at N3.1billion.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: National Chairma... by Sahara Reporters",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS).

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It was launched in 2018 as the founders hoped to combat the sale of fake drugs and consumer goods. Some investors in the round include Launch Africa and Japan Strategic Capital.\n\nCo-founded by Dare Odumade (CEO) and Oluwatosin Adelowo (CMO), the startup is a subsidiary of Chekkit Technologies. It helps consumers determine the authenticity of a product using their mobile phones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a problem. The sale of fake drugs and consumer goods thrives in Africa, primarily because of lax regulatory oversight in the pharmaceutical and food industry.\n\nBetween November 2008 and February 2009, a tragedy hit Nigeria as 84 children died after being given a supposed teething drug containing harmful chemical substances.\n\nAlthough measures \u2014 like the NAFDAC Product Registration Verify \u2014 have been put in place to reduce these occurrences, fake consumer goods still saturate the market. This is due to cheap products and low awareness of verification processes for most people in low-income areas.\n\nRemember this? Nigerian deep tech startup, RxAll is looking to squash the $30 billion global fake drug industry\n\nBefore this funding, Chekkit relied on grants. But with this pre-seed, the startup is looking to expand its team and build technological infrastructure.\n\nYou can read more about Chekkit\u2019s pre-seed here.\n\nTapping global investment currents\n\nPartnership\n\n\n\nWhat does a partnership between a Nigeria-based investment-tech startup and a global investment social network platform spell for investors? I smell access to more international stocks, and consequently, better investment decisions.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Chaka, a Nigerian investment startup, which enables local investors to access foreign stocks, has announced its partnership with TradingView.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? With this partnership, Chaka is now a local, licenced broker with the TradingView investment platform.\n\nThis means users with a brokerage account on Chaka can now track and access global investment opportunities, track and place a trade directly on world trading charts, communicate with world trade markets, and access analytical investment tools.\n\nRecall that Chaka is also the first digital investment platform to secure Nigeria\u2019s new digital sub-broker licence. It looks like it\u2019s raining first-mover advantage this year, as this partnership also makes them the first African stockbroker for TradingView.\n\nA visit to TradingView\u2019s platform revealed that they offer cryptocurrency trading. Does this mean that, by extension, Chaka users can also buy and/or trade cryptocurrency? Highly unlikely, taking into account current CBN regulations and SEC\u2019s non-committal stance.\n\nWell, with this partnership, Chaka\u2019s users may now be able to make better investment decisions and access a wide range of real-time, global trading options.\n\nMoove announces $23m Series A to scale across Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoove\u2019s founders, Jide Odunsi and Ladi Delano\n\nAnother rain of funds? Africa-focused mobility financing startup, Moove, has announced closing a $23m Series A. This funding was led by Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital and saw participation from Esmo Asset Management \u2014 previous lenders \u2014 and Kepple Africa Ventures, among others.\n\nFirst time raising? It\u2019s a Series A, so, definitely not their first time. The platform initially raised a $5.2m seed round in 2020 and $40m in debt financing, bringing its total funding to $68.2m.\n\nOkay, why so much funds? Well, Moove is a revenue-based vehicle financing company that helps drivers on ride-hailing platforms purchase new cars, and pay in instalments. It is currently Uber\u2019s exclusive vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWith this raise, Moove is looking to scale across Africa, create access to electric vehicles for drivers, hire more female drivers, and create wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts.\n\nMore information about Moove\u2019s Series A in this article: Nigeria-based mobility fintech, Moove raises $23 million Series A\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nHow to Think: The Skill You\u2019ve Never Been Taught.

The company also received a grant from Netherlands\u2019 Orange Corners programme.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Dare Odumade, CEO and Oluwatosin Adelowo, CMO, Chekkit offers product verification and anti-counterfeiting solutions using Blockchain. The company claims to protect manufacturers and consumers against food and drug counterfeits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Chekkit announced a pilot in Afghanistan. This move came after the company finished as the first runner up in a Blockchain pitch competition \u2014 sponsored by Fantom, a DAG-based smart contract platform \u2014 at the AfricArena Summit in November 2019.\n\nAfter the event, Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Health signed an MoU with Fantom and Chekkit for a 3-month pilot project to track and verify 80,000 pharmaceutical products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Dare Odumade, CEO; Samuel Ukhueleigbe, CTO; and Oluwatosin Adelowo, CMO. Source: Supplied\n\nSpeaking on why they chose Chekkit as a viable investment, Biola Alabi, a leader of one of the angel syndicate groups, says it was a no-brainer to do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that the company is building and using blockchain to build out its solution. Chekkit, with an experienced team, local and global traction, are poised to save more lives, and I\u2019m proud to be an investor and lead a team of other investors to build.\u201d\n\nAlabi will join the Chekkit\u2019s advisory board, bringing with her years of experience in media and communications. She currently serves as a non-executive director at Unilever Nigeria Plc.\n\nAs contained in the company\u2019s statement, Chekkit has secured over 7 million pharmaceutical products, protected over 200,000 consumers, and expanded its partnership with the Afghan government to verify and track over 200 million products.\n\nIt has worked with pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Royal Star Pharma, and Nabros Pharmaceutical in Afghanistan. Chekkit has also worked with Indomie, Nivea, and Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc.\n\nIn 2020, the company deployed its COVID-19 USSD Help & Information Center in partnership with the African Union and the Africa Centre for Disease Control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica suffers significantly from the counterfeit drug menace. According to a 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) study (PDF), an estimated 10% of all medicines in low-to-middle income countries are counterfeited.\n\nAnother 2017 report by WHO reveals that 42% of all fake medicines reported to the Organization were from Africa.\n\nA 2018 WHO factsheet on substandard and falsified medical products reveals that between 64,000 and 158,000 people die from counterfeit anti-malarial drugs in sub-Saharan Africa per year.\n\nThat number accounted for about 38% of malaria deaths in Africa \u2014 409,000 \u2014 in 2019.\n\nCurrently, in Africa, startups like Chekkit and deep tech startup RxAll are trying to combat this problem.\n\nIn May 2021, Ivory Coast\u2019s Ministry of Health announced a partnership with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and German anti-counterfeiting company, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.\n\nSpeaking on the raise, Odumade says, \u201cWe are super-pumped about the future as we develop unique technological products to protect the lives of millions and also directly improve the act of doing business for several brands by learning about consumers in the largely informal African markets.\u201d\n\nHe also reveals plans to launch \u201cthe first consumer intelligence software-as-a-service for consumer brands to create end-to-end loyalty campaigns, aggregate engagement data and distribute rewards in-house and with their marketing agencies for the first time ever, enabling consumers to directly interact with brands through QR and USSD shortcodes printed directly on the product package.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based auto-financing startup, Moove has announced a $23 million Series A to build a full-service mobility fintech that democratises vehicle ownership across Africa. The round was led by global VC, Speedinvest and New York-based Left Lane Capital.\n\nOthers include DCM Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, London-based LocalGlobe, California-based Tekton Ventures, New York-based FJ Labs, and New York-based Palm Drive Capital.\n\nThe list continues with Singapore-based Roka Works, Dubai-based KAAF Investments, Abu Dhabi-based Spartech Ventures, California-based Class 5 Global, and Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable.\n\nAfrica focused VC Verod Capital Management, Kepple Africa Ventures, and London-based Emso Asset Management \u2014 one of Moove\u2019s existing lenders \u2014 joined the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Yahoo! Finance, the company says this is the first African investment by many of the US-based VCs in this round. This brings Moove\u2019s total funding to $68.2 million \u2014 $28.2 million in equity and $40 million in debt.\n\nAccording to Technext, Chisom Anoke, Moove Africa\u2019s Country Manager, says this funding would enable the company to expand into more states in Nigeria, increase gender equality in the industry while creating job opportunities both within Moove and for its entrepreneurial customer base.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, the co-founders initially bootstrapped the company. However, in 2020, Moove raised a $5.2 million seed round and launched fully in June 2020.\n\nMoove\u2019s business model involves providing up to 95% in vehicle financing to its customers, which can be paid back either in 24, 36, or 48 months using a percentage of their weekly earnings.\n\nThe company also has a Flexi-Rental option which gives customers access to new cars for a weekly rental fee. Moove aims to ensure 60% of all loans are used to purchase electric or hybrid vehicles. A trend which seems to be gaining ground in Africa.\n\nAccess to vehicle financing in Africa is a struggle. In Nigeria, for example, as of 2016, Deloitte reveals that only 2% of Nigerians could afford to pay for new vehicles. Quite unimpressive numbers for a country that has a population of over 200 million.\n\nExpounding on this, Delano said, \u201cIn a continent full of opportunity, mobility is key to moving economies forward, and this funding contributes to our ability to provide revenue-based financing, as Moove empowers Africans to become mobility entrepreneurs safely.\n\n\u201cWe help people buy new cars who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford them. And then, using the vehicle as a mobility entrepreneur, they\u2019re able to earn money, which allows them to pay off the vehicle over time,\u201d he concludes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is Uber\u2019s sole partner in sub-Saharan Africa for vehicle financing and recently announced a partnership with Global Accelerex to make payments seamless for riders in Moove financed cars.\n\nMoove is focused on mobility entrepreneurs \u2014 persons in the ride-hailing and e-logistics space \u2014 and is currently operating in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa. The company claims its financed cars have completed more than 850,000 Uber trips and currently enjoys a 60% month-on-month growth.\n\nAn instrumental factor, as Stefan Klestil, General Partner at Speedinvest, explains. \u201cWith Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has quickly established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where just five per cent of new cars are purchased with financing, compared to 92 per cent in Europe.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This year\u2019s summer travel is losing momentum for many Nigerian holiday makers who are now cancelling foreign leisure and travel plans following the surge in the new Delta variant of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Nigerian wanderlusts, who shelved their summer trips last year due to the ravaging pandemic, are further cancelling this year\u2019s holiday abroad because of the continued imposition of restrictions in desired destinations, stress of several COVID-19 tests, fear of being quarantined, visa issues, scarcity of flight and high cost of airfare, hotel accommodation, among other challenges.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), there has been a 60 percent drop in summer ticket sales this year compared with 2019 because of the decline in bookings for foreign destinations.\n\nHowever, the challenges have become gains for some African destinations that are now opening their doors and reaping huge traffic from Nigerian holiday makers.\n\nAccording to most tour operators, Egypt is the leading destination for Nigerians this summer, followed by East African countries of Mauritius, Kenya, Rwanda, while Ghana and the Gambia draw a few from their West African neighbour.\n\n\u201cThe destination that is trending now for summer is Egypt. It is where a lot of people are going in the last two months because it is the only place that is open and Nigerians can shop. Dubai and Turkey are not open,\u201d Ikechi Uko, CEO, Akwaaba African Travel Market and top executive of the Nigerian Association of Tour Operators (NATOP), says.\n\nUko, an African tourism, hospitality and aviation expert, explains that while some people are going to Mauritius, Kenya and other places in East Africa, the numbers are going to Egypt.\n\nRead Also: Egypt\u2019s 3yr economic plan holds lessons for Nigeria\n\nAccording to Uko, the development is a loss for Dubai, where many Nigerians throng for holiday until COVID-19 disruption and a huge gain for Egypt and Africa at large.\n\nConfirming the trend, Busola Audu, another tour operator, notes that Egypt has never been on the map for Nigerian tourists like it is now, while attributing the positive turn to easy visa, cheap flights and breath-taking attractions, including great shopping opportunities.\n\nShe also notes that East Africa is not a surprise because of the years of consistence in developing their tourism, awesome wildlife, aggressive marketing to Nigerians, easy entry and several flight options.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa used to draw more Nigerian tourists than any other African country during summer, but the challenges posed by the pandemic, which is very high there, lack of flights; Air Peace has stopped flights to SA, then the impossible visa and high cost as well, all combined to make trips to Johannesburg or Cape Town difficult this summer,\u201d she states.\n\nAlso confirming the shift to African destinations, Susan Akporiaye, president, NANTA, says many intending Nigerian holiday makers who usually visit European countries, US and Dubai for summer are holding back on travels this year as a result of the new travel restrictions and fear of contacting the COVID-19.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is still there and it is disrupting travels because people still have reservations about travelling and countries are refusing to lift the conditions,\u201d Akporiaye says.\n\nThe NANTA president explains further that the 10-day quarantine imposed by UK government has continued to discourage Nigerians from travelling this summer.\n\n\u201cSome of our clients want to travel but they do not want to do quarantine. Usually for summer, people travel with children, but now, nobody wants to expose their children to COVID-19. Travel bookings for summer this period are essential travels. The entire family trip that we usually have for summer is no longer happening,\u201d she states.\n\nShe however observes that more people are travelling to Canada not for summer, but for relocation.\n\nSummer travels are picking up especially to African destinations, with travel agents now getting requests to Egypt, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya and Zanzibar for summer, she confirms what others earlier say\n\nAccording to Akporiaye, since the Dubai ban, people are travelling to African countries that have visa-on-arrival policy.\n\n\u201cRwanda is now becoming the Dubai of Nigerians. It is a very beautiful place with visa-on-arrival, so there is a lot of rush for Rwanda this summer,\u201d she states further.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about the Delta variant,\u201d Glenn Fogel, CEO, Booking Holdings Inc., an online-travel agency, says in an interview.\n\nAs well, travel agents decry slight pullback in booking trends in July compared with June.\n\nThe highly contagious variant, according to them, is the spoiler, when the world is hoping to use this year\u2019s summer sales to boost the recovery of the tourism sector.\n\nAt present, the US bars most non-US citizens, who within the last 14 days have been in the UK, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without internal border controls, or in Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.\n\nThe US travel restrictions were first imposed on China in January 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19. Other countries have since been added, most recently India in early May.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State-Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project has condemned a viral video of a protest by some persons purported to be living around the project catchment area of Gapiona, noting that claims in the said video were falsely represented.\n\nCommunication Officer, Edo NEWMAP, Ivy Adodo, in a statement, noted that \u201cthe viral video was recorded last year and was used as a political tool/campaign against the Government at the peak of the governorship election of 2020 by the proponents of the said video sometime in June 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adodo, \u201cWhile most of the claims in the said video were falsely represented, as at today every person whose property has been affected has been fully paid by the Government of Edo State that is responsible for the payment of compensation and not the World Bank as also erroneously conveyed by the proponent of the video.\n\n\u201cThe project is by the Edo State Government and not a World Bank project as erroneously conveyed in the said video. Furthermore, the Gapiona flood Project was initiated at the instance of the State Government and not the other way.\n\n\u201cThe Gapiona erosion control project consists of various sub-catchments and communities in the catchment area including but not limited to Gapiona, Ruben Agho, Ebo, Ogumwenyin, Ugieokuin, and several other areas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further reads: \u201cThe Proposed Pond 1 area of the current Gapiona flood alleviation project is the lowest point in the whole catchment and naturally the place for settlement of the whole flood within the area. Residents in Gapiona area have lived with the erosion problem for over 20 years, this has led to many residents fleeing their homes while majority of the access roads linking the area has been rendered impassable.\n\n\u201cThe intense flooding being experienced in the area in recent times is due to the impact of climate change resulting from high runoff and higher intensity of rainfall and the indiscriminate fencing and obstruction of waterways by residence.\n\n\u201cThis very problem is the reason for the prioritization of this project by the state government and the reason for its intervention through Edo State NEWMAP.\u201d\n\nNoting the government\u2019s commitment to tackle the problem of flooding in Edo communities and alleviate the sufferings of the people, Adodo stated: \u201cIt, therefore, may not be charitable if NEWMAP, an intervention project is now erroneously being held responsible for the flooding of homes within this area, which is a very unfortunate and regrettable event.\n\n\u201cThe Engineering Design being implemented by the State Government as cleared was designed by the number 1 rated Engineering design firm in Africa, reviewed by the Federal Project Management Unit of NEWMAP, through a renowned Engineering design firm and finally cleared by a combined team of Engineers from the FAO and the World bank.\n\n\u201cThe government is implementing a world class design through one of the best construction companies in Nigeria also approved by the World Bank.\n\n\u201cNEWMAP\u2019s intervention in the area has brought succor to residents in the sections where work has been completed.\n\n\u201cEdo State NEWMAP has worked at 15 locations/sites and has successfully completed six other flood and gully erosion control projects (Edo College, Queen Ede, Ekehuan, all in Benin City; Oshiobugie in Auchi, Ibore and Ewu both in Esan Central LGA) in Edo state in line with best global practices and these communities are now better off.\n\n\u201cThese are all there for verification. The completed work will be to the benefit of all residents in the catchment area in the long run.\u201d\n\nAccording to Edo NEWMAP, \u201cIt may interest you to note that there are 23 participating States in Nigeria and the last two evaluation and ratings of performance, Edo State came tops under the leadership of the Project Coordinator, Dr. Tom Obaseki.\n\n\u201cTrying to malign his professionalism and personality is an exercise in futility. While the project is concerned with the current challenges being faced by the residents, we want to assure that every step is being taken to accelerate the process of implementation. We appeal to residents, particularly those within the Pond1 area for their patience as the project which is in progress is in the advanced stages of completion.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "In its fulfilment to enable the development of National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), the federal government of Nigeria, through the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, under the leadership of honourable minister, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, has kick-started a pioneer programme to train members of Kano executive council on e-governance and digital transformation.\n\nThe programme was initiated to give special training to the top government officials in the state on modern technology adoption, in order to improve their performances at all levels while delivering services to the general public.\n\nThe two-day event, which commenced August 2, 2021, was attended by Kano state governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, his deputy, Dr Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, secretary to the state government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, Commissioners, and other members of the executive council of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile making his address, Dr Ganduje thanked the federal government, particularly the ministry for bringing various initiatives, including training of over 1000 youths on digital skills and other supports provided in the state.\n\nThe governor commended Dr Pantami for matching words with action, adding that the e-governance training was as a result of his visit to the Communications and Digital Economy Complex in Abuja where he initiated talks on the possible collaboration and partnership with the Ministry to foster ICT development in Kano state.\n\nHe also hinted his government\u2019s commitment towards the realisation of ICT policy in the state. According to him, ICT has been a critical element to governance, and his administration is making all efforts to ensure that the state taps on the immense benefit of e-Governance and digital technologies by simplifying government operations as well as limiting government spending.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is imperative we apply the new system being used anywhere in the world, because the old system of government would not move the state forward.\u201d The governor assured that he would continue to come up with ways to streamline government operations and reduce the cost of running his administration.\n\nOn his part, Dr Pantami, while delivering his keynote address, noted that the training is the first of its kind in Nigeria at the state level, and there cannot be a better place to start than Kano State, according to him, Kano state is the most populous state in Nigeria and the commercial nerve centre of Northern Nigeria.\n\nHe said, historically, the people of Kano have always been known to be hardworking and industrious. \u201cThey were among the first people to establish major industries and conglomerates in Nigeria, trading in food and drinks, textile and footwear, tanning, ceramics, and furniture,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Pantami stated that the commencement of the programme makes Kano State Executive Council Members the first beneficiaries, which at the end, Kano will be well positioned to develop a strong digital economy, and have a transformational impact on the state and the nation at large.\n\nHe said that in light of global trends in the delivery of government services which is increasingly being characterized by the digitization of processes, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy developed the Nigerian e-Government Master Plan (Ne-GMP) with the vision \u201cto create a world class, open and digitized government that connects with people to drive efficiency in public administration, responsiveness of civil services and transparency in governance leading to improvement of the quality of life of Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the Ministry\u2019s mandate to Utilize ICT to drive transparency in governance and improve the quality and cost effectiveness of public service delivery in Nigeria. The Plan was developed with specific strategies that will improve the quality of citizen\u2018s lives by enhancing national competitiveness, facilitating market economy, promoting participatory democracy, and improving transparency in the public sector.\n\n\u201cThese strategies include the expansion of the number of public sector personnel trained on e-Government and the publicizing of e-Government initiatives at the Federal and State Level. Various Capacity Building Programs have therefore been developed to aid the attainment of this goal,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Pantami stated that the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) was developed and launched in 2019 to reposition the Nigerian Economy in order to take advantage of the many opportunities that digital technologies provide. \u201cThis is in line with the vision of President Muhammadu Buhari to diversify the economy of Nigeria away from the dependence on the oil and gas sector, he said.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, the NDEPS is anchored on eight (pillars, one of which is the Digital Literacy and Skills Pillar which provides policy backing for massive training of Nigerians from all works of life in order to enable them obtain digital literacy and other digital skills. An objective of the NDEPS is to support training and Capacity Building among public sector employees in the development and use of digital tools and applications to improve the delivery of government services.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Service Infrastructure Pillar provides support for Government Digital Services and the provision of robust digital platforms to drive the Digital Economy. This pillar supports the provision of a online platforms for government to interact with citizens and investors. It supports the deployment of government digital services and a paperless system. A key objective of the Service Infrastructure Pillar is the implementation of the e-Government Master Plan,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Pantami also seized the opportunity to express his sincere appreciation to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for providing the vision and leadership as well as his unwavering support, saying that \u201cwe could not have been able to achieve what the Ministry and its Parastatals achieved without Mr President\u2019s continued support and we are most appreciative.\u201d",

Buni also said that he owns a five-bedroom flat on Court Road, Grace Yard, Karu Abuja, which he purchased for N60 million in 2016.\n\nThe governor also listed a six-bedroom duplex with conference room that he purchased for N150 million in 2019. The address of the building is 146 Cadastaral, Zone A03, Garki, Abuja.\n\nHe also has a five-bedroom duplex in Kano\u2019s Kwakwasiya Housing Estate, No 101. He told the CCB that he paid N37.447 million for it.\n\nThe governor also revealed that he has a four-bedroom duplex at No 11, Chartown Street, Wuse Zone 5, Abuja, which he purchased in 2018 for N150 million.\n\nBuni, a man with no known business interests other than being a politician, owns a three-story building with a penthouse at No 22, Asika Street, Asokoro, Abuja. This, he said the CCB, was purchased for N1.3 billion on December 6, 2016.\n\nIn 2015, the governor purchased another four-bedroom duplex at N55 million.\n\nHe has an 18-room property at No 1, Ibrahim Close, Damboa Road, Maiduguri, Borno State, which he purchased for N50 million on May 31, 2015.\n\nThe APC Caretaker Chairman also acknowledged ownership of two Maiduguri filling stations that he purchased for N280 million in 2018. His property also included a three-bedroom flat near the School of Health in Maiduguri, which he purchased for N25 million in 2016.\n\nBuni also paid N700 million for a landed property at 151 Cadastral, Zone D in Abuja. He told the CCB that he bought it in 2016.\n\nThe governor also listed other properties in Damaturu, Maiduguri, Kano, and Abuja that cost N2 million, N5 million, N8 million, N10 million, and N20 million each.\n\nHe also stated at the time that the property produced no annual rent income.\n\nBuni stated that he has N1.3 billion in his Keystone bank account (1004339343) as of May 23, 2019. He claimed to have N439 million in his Zenith bank account (1014214784).\n\nIn addition, the governor claimed to have N912 million in his Fidelity bank account (5600287335). He also stated that his Access bank account (0807440003) has 95 million dollars in it.\n\nBuni also revealed to the CCB that he had millions of naira in eight other accounts.\n\nHe also claimed to be the proud owner of over 20 vehicles worth millions of naira, which he acquired through personal savings/loans and the assistance of friends.\n\nA source at the CCB previously told SaharaReporters that the agency\u2019s inquiry into what he called the governor\u2019s anticipatory declaration had progressed far.\n\n\u201cThey are doing everything to cover the scandal up but investigation is really ongoing. Even though his associates are doing everything to cover up the scandal, we believe President Muhammad Buhari won\u2019t interfere and ensure proper probe of the scandal in line with his claims of zero tolerance for corruption,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Monday exclusively reported how spirited efforts by the governor and his backers to cover up the scandal failed last week when his pre-tenure form (form CC81) which was deposited at CCB on May 23, 2019 got leaked to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Department of State Security Services and the National Intelligence Agency.\n\n\u201cThough he has immunity but he committed offences contrary to Section 15 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 which are punishable under Section 23 (2) of the same Act,\u201d a government house source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nAn analysis of the document submitted by the governor showed that He declared having N2billion as cash in six Nigerian banks.\n\nFurther checks showed that the accounts are being operated by one firm, MDG construction and general company limited.\n\nBuni, in the document, however, claimed to have no cash in foreign accounts.\n\nDespite claiming his two main source of income were farming and business, a closer look at the document revealed that the governor declared 25 buildings in Abuja, Kano and Yobe states valued at N3.1billion.",

          "text": "Will National Chairman Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Prince Uche Secondus go the way of sacked Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC)?\n\nThis is one question that will be answered in the fullness of time as the leadership crisis facing the opposition PDP deepened Monday with some stakeholders calling for the sack of the embattled party chair.\n\nHow Oshiomhole was booted out\n\nAt the height of the APC crises, some party chieftains insisted Oshiomhole must go if the party was to make any reasonable inroad and shore up its support base following a string of electoral losses it suffered under his leadership.\n\nFor instance, it is on record that the loss suffered by the APC in Zamfara state following protracted rift between the Abdulaziz Yari-led faction and that led by Senator Kabiru Marafa, was blamed on Oshiomhole\u2019s handling of the row.\n\nThe result was that the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the PDP candidate, Muhammad Bello Matawalle as the duly elected governor.\n\nMatawalle has since defected to the APC.\n\nSimilarly, the APC National Working Committee (NWC) under Oshiomhole was also faulted for \u2018pushing\u2019 Edo state Governor Godwin Obaseki out of the party, with the governor later joining the PDP.\n\nWith these and other pockets of crises within some chapters of the party, the National Executive Council (NEC) met and dissolved the party leadership under the former Edo state governor.\n\nSecondus\u2019 travails\n\nSimilar scenarios are playing out in PDP as the crises get messier Monday with 6 out of the 18-member NWC signed in support of the compulsory resignation of the party chair, Prince Scondus.\n\nAt a meeting late Sunday night in Abuja, the six NWC members agreed that \u201cSecondus has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\u201d\n\nMaking their position known in an unsigned statement, they said: \u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, 6 members voted that he should resign and 3 members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors\u2019 forum, the BOT, the national assembly caucus of both House of Reps and the Senate.\u201d\n\nThey called on all members of the party to remain calm \u201cas the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Senator Suleiman Nazif \u2013 deputy national chairman (North), Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri \u2013 National Secretary, Alhaji Mai Adamu Mustapha \u2013 National Auditor, Abdulahi Maibasira \u2013 National Financial Secretary, Rt. Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye \u2013 National Youth Leader, Ambassador Taofiq Arapaja \u2013 National Vice Chairman (SW), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dan Osi Orbih -National Vice Chairman (SS) and Chief Theophilus Dakas National Vice Chairman (NC).\n\n\u201cThose who voted in favour that Prince Uche Secondus should resign were: Senator Suleiman Nazif \u2013 Deputy National Chairman (N). Alhaji Mai Adamu Mustapher -National Auditor, Rt. Hon. S.K.E Udeh- Okoye, Ambassador Taofiq Arapaja \u2013 National Vice Chairman (SW), Chief Dan Orbih National Vice Chairman (SS) and Chief Dr. Ali Odefa National Vice Chairman (SE),\u201d the statement further said.\n\nWhen contacted, a few NWC members, who attended the meeting and spoke to Blueprint under anonymity confirmed the statement.\n\nYouth group\n\nSimilarly, a group \u2013 Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups -protested Monday in Abuja and called for Secondus\u2019 removal.\n\nLeader of the group, Mr Tamunotonye Inioribo, while addressing journalists Monday in Abuja, said the protest was organised by a coalition of different PDP support groups dissatisfied with the leadership of Secondus.\n\nInioribo who accused Secondus of polarising the party for his own selfish interest, said, \u201cUnder Secondus, the PDP Governors Forum, National Working Committee and other organs are divided.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were seen carrying placards with different inscriptions such as \u201cSecondus Must Go\u201d, \u201cwe have lost confidence in your chairmanship\u201d, \u201cwe cannot afford to lose more governors\u201d among others.\n\nReps too\u2026\n\nAlso, the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, asked the party chair to quit office so the party could commence preparation ahead 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nin a statement jointly signed by its leader, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, and his deputy, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, the lawmakers said Secondus should \u201cconsider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt also appealed to the party\u2019s BOT and the Governors Forum to ensure immediate and firm resolution of current challenges so as to enable a \u201cre-engineering, re-focusing process that would restore party members and millions of other Nigerians\u2019 hope and confidence in the PDP as an alternative to the current dysfunctional, irresponsive and rudderless government of APC with its attendant suffering, miseries, political deceit, economic woes, insecurity and all-round disappointment foisted on millions of Nigerian families across the federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe caucus said it arrived at the decision at the end of a virtual meeting of members Saturday August 7, 2021 over current concerns on the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThey accused Secondus of placing personal interests above building a vibrant opposition political party as expected in a democratic setting, noting that \u201cPDP members and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipate vigorous and well coordinated issue-based national opposition in preparation for a national convention and the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTo many, the National Chairman seems much more contented with occupying the office and therefore preoccupied with holding onto his position rather than preparing for next elections; this explains for his inexplicably missing endless opportunities that ought to have been utilized for consolidating a viable opposition; skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition and frustrating genuine party members across states which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no clear road map, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the Chairman, thus the party is allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe lax and bedroom managerial attitude of the Chairman who runs the party from his home and only surfaces in the party office for meetings, coupled with several promises without commensurate action has led to inept management of complaints, despondency amongst members and consequently an exodus of members of the party at all levels, including a member of the Board of Trustee of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhilst these misfortunes befell the party and concerned party members are busy trying to stem the tide, the party Chairman has carried on as if all is well and does not appear to see the caldron awaiting the party if it continues on that trajectory\u201d, the caucus\u2019 statement said in part.\n\nNational vice chairs join call\n\nIn the same vein, the party\u2019s national vice chairmen are also asking for Secondus\u2019 resignation.\n\nIn a statement Monday in Ibadan, the party\u2019s national vice chair in the South-west, Ambassador Taofeek Oladejo Arapaja, said the decision was the outcome of an emergency meeting of the national vice-chairmen held in Abuja Sunday to review developments within the party.\n\nThe statement said the meeting also urged stakeholders to remain steadfast \u201cas PDP remains the hope of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nArapaja listed the resolutions to include; \u201cThat the National Chairman of the party Prince Uche Secondus, Should resign and save the party from further disintegration being witness presently in the party.\n\n\u201cThat the resignation of its national officers is as a result of the inert leadership of the National Chairman, and as well the movement of Governor of the party to the failed ruling party.\n\n\u201cThey as well resolved that all Party stakeholders and party faithful should remain calm and resolute to the party as the party is the only hope of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe resolution was jointly signed by the National Vice-chairman of people Democratic party (PDP) from South-wWest Zone Ambassador Taofeek Oladejo Arapaja, South South Zone Chief Dan Osi, South-east Chief (Dr) Ali Odefa and North-central Dankas Shau.\n\nReps\u2019 minority leader differs\n\nBut contrary to the caucus\u2019 position, the House minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu said there was no meeting where such decision was taken.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Elumelu said: \u201cAttention of the Minority Caucus, particularly members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives, have been drawn to news reports purporting to be the intervention and outcome of an online meeting of the PDP Caucus in the House regarding the current leadership challenge within the party.\n\n\u201cIf such a meeting held, it was without the knowledge of the leadership of the Minority Caucus, and therefore in breach of established procedure.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we are working in concert with organs of the party to ensure sustainable resolution of the current challenges that will be in the overall interest of the party and Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all party faithful, particularly PDP members in the House of Representatives, to exercise caution and patience as the party addresses the present leadership challenges.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t quit -Secondus\n\nAmidst the tension generated by the call for his resignation, the party chair insisted he would not quit office.\n\nIn a statement Monday by his special adviser on media, Ike Abonyi, the embattled party chair said: \u201cNothing so far warrants his resignation from the party position and those tiny minority calling for his resignation should come clean and tell party members across the country his offense why he should resign.\n\n\u201cHe said he will remain focused and committed to the ideals of the party which he swore to protect and defend upon his election to lead this great party 44 months ago.\u201d\n\n\u2018Call violation of extant laws\u2019\n\nBacking Secondus also, the party\u2019s legal adviser, Emmanuel Enoidem said the call for his resignation was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, he said: \u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cSubsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge am not aware of any meeting of NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of resignation of any officer of our party at any level is a personal decision as stipulated in Sections 45(1) & 47 (5). There is no provision of our constitution which donates powers to any organ, individuals or group of persons to ask an officer of the party to resign for any reason whatsoever as was purported in the so called press release.\n\n\u201cThe powers to remove any member of the NWC and indeed any national officer is reserved in the national convention which is due for December 2021. The said press release is an unfortunate assault and blatant violation of the provisions of our constitution and so it is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThis is more so when the purported meeting was said to have been convened on Sunday August 8, 2021 against the widely published position taken by the BOT advising members and leaders of our party to maintain peace until a committee set up has deliberated on the raging controversies.\n\n\u201cThis bad press caused the party at this critical time is most uncalled for, needless and wanton and must be discontinued if we are mindful of the interest of the party.\u201d\n\nDickson backs Secondus\n\nAlso drumming support for Secondus, Senator Seriake Dickson (PDP Bayelsa West) said the party chair cannot be stampeded out of office.\n\nDickson, who stated this Monday in a personally signed statement in Abuja, said only National Convention of the party can remove Secondus as chairman and not antagonistic NWC members.\n\nHe said the call for Secondus resignation by some members of the party was orchestrated and aimed at throwing the party into needless crisis ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe purported call made by the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives for Secondus resignation is a ruse as the leader of the caucus , Hon Ndudi Elumelu , had issued a rebuttal.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to a purported statement by some members of the National Working Committee who went outside the constitution of the party and convened a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the chairman.\n\n\u201cI want to draw the attention of PDP leaders, members and Nigerians at large that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and does not represent a valid resolution or decision of the National Working Committee known to the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, only the national chairman of the party can summon and preside over meetings of the organs of the party especially the NWC of which he is chairman. So the purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: 3 members of the working committee and 3 Vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians should disregard the reported decision of the purported rep caucus meeting.\u201d\n\nGovs determine fate today\n\nMeanwhile, governors elected on the PDP platform, would continue their meeting today (Tuesday) to decide the fate of the party\u2019s embattled chair.\n\nThey had earlier met Monday at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro District, Abuja, but couldn\u2019t conclude deliberations at the end of their meeting.\n\nSecondus arrived venue of the meeting a few minutes after 4 p.m.\n\nLast week, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum appealed for calm over the leadership crisis currently bedevilling the party.",

          "text": "Two passengers on an inter-state mass transit bus were killed with three vehicles set ablaze by people suspected to be enforcing the sit-at- home order by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) at Nkwogwu, Mbaise in Imo state Monday morning.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that two of the vehicles were inter-state mass transit buses owned by one company, while the other was a Siena vehicle which was identified as the only vehicle plying the Mbaise-Umuahia road early morning.\n\nWhen confronted by the IPOB members on why they were flouting the order, their response was unsatisfactory and the assailants pounced on them and burnt the vehicles, killing two people in the process.\n\nAs at the time of this report, the stat Police Command had not responded to this development but the video has continued to go viral.\n\nMeanwhile, the sit-at-home order has partially succeeded in the state.\n\nThis followed Monday\u2019s news on social media that Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s brother, Kanunta, had suspended the order which IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful countered some minutes later.\n\nMany markets in Owerri, Orlu and Okigwe zones were open but with few traders going about their normal businesses as directed by the police amidst fear.\n\nBlueprint observed that a few vehicles were plying the route while some people were seen cautiously walking on the streets.\n\nAwka\n\nAlso, not less than two persons were reportedly shot dead at Nnewi, Nnewi North LGA of Anambra state, following an alleged clash between some security men and Eastern Security Network (ESN) trying to enforce the sit-at-home order.\n\nA source told Blueprint that the deceased were a leader of ESN and a commercial motorcyclist purportedly conveying him to and fro the industrial hub of Africa to enforce the sit-at-home order after setting up road blocks across major roads.\n\n\u201cThe two people were a leader of ESN and Okada rider. They were killed by men in military uniform during a bloody confrontation at Izuchukwu junction area. IPOB members blockaded most of the roads to prevent vehicular movements. Some soldiers came later to clear the road. It was in the process they shot at the two during altercation,\u201d a source alleged.\n\nMeanwhile, all markets, stalls, shops, commercial banks and other public institutions at Nnewi, Nkpor, Ekwulobia, Awka and Onitsha metropolis remained shut as at press time even as roads recorded fewer passersby and vehicular movements.\n\nSimilarly, few civil servants were spotted at the state secretariat and Government House despite the presence of police and other security officers positioned at some strategic locations in Awka.\n\n\u201cWe came because of the threats to withhold our August salary. I have written my name and am going home. Next week own may be worst because we were disappointed. Our HoDs told us they will monitor us to punish those who failed to come to office. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see her. My colleagues from other ministries and departments are complaining too. Not even a single commissioner is around,\u201d a civil servant lamented.\n\nEnugu\n\nSimilarly, major streets in Enugu metropolis were deserted in compliance with the IPOB order.\n\nMarkets, shops, banks, schools were shut too, save few schools where students were taking Mathematics for NECO examination.\n\n\n\nInvestigation shows that there was total compliance in Enugu metropolis and beyond as most people stayed at home.\n\nBut for the importance of the NECO exams, the compliance would have been overwhelming, it was gathered.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople complied with the sit-at-home here at Nsukka. It is however not as severe as it is in Enugu but people obeyed,\u201d a respondent from Nsukka said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is total compliance here at Emene where I live,\u201d Ede Oko said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is more acute here at Edinburgh, Ogui New Layout. The streets are deserted. You only see vehicles pass once in a while,\u201d Emma Nwokeukwu said.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the ever busy Agbani Road and Garriki, Awkunawnaw Market were ghosts of their former selves as motorists and traders were nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nPeople who spoke to our correspondent on the development had varied opinions.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany people are tired of Nigeria and want Biafra. They believe that Nnamdi Kanu should be released unconditionally because he is a freedom fighter since the Fulani herdsmen that kill and molest people are never arrested,\u201d Chijoke Madukwe said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany people complied not because they believe in Biafra liberation or Nnamdi Kanu but because of fear of what could happen should they come out. People don\u2019t believe that security agents would protect them if attacked,\u201d Chukwuma Ezioha said.\n\n\n\nHowever, at the time of this report, it was not possible to get the police spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe to speak on the development.\n\n\n\nUnconfirmed report however had it that some hoodlums accosted policemen patrolling the streets snatched their vehicle at Garriki and set it on fire.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has called on state governments and citizens to take more proactive steps to combat the outbreak of cholera across states in Nigeria.\n\nThe agency made the appeal in a report released on Monday, where it stated that there have been 31,425 suspected cases of cholera and 816 deaths reported from 22 states and the FCT, between January 1 and August 1, 2021.\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and the FCT.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, the recent outbreak has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nAlthough the NCDC activated the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on June 22 and has deployed rapid response teams to support the most affected states, it warned that those actions won\u2019t be enough.\n\n\u201cNone of these medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks,\u201d it warned.\n\n\u201cCholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, practices such as the wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use.\n\n\u201cThese lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths,\u201d the NCDC added.\n\nTo address the underlying issues in the long term, there is a need for access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene.\n\n\u201cWe continue to advocate for State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities,\u201d it added.\n\nAlso, the agency urged Nigerians to \u201ckeep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running water\u201d.\n\nApart from calling for stronger water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), the NCDC is also ramping up efforts to stop the outbreak through the EOC, which is hosted at the NCDC includes representation from the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.\n\nSo far, it has deployed rapid response teams to Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi, and Plateau State, which are the most affected states.\n\nAdditionally, it has, along with its partners, provided states with commodities for case management and laboratory diagnosis, materials for risk communications, response guidelines among other support.\n\nFrom July 24 to 28, a reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA.\n\nThe Cholera outbreak in Nigeria has worsened in recent months with more states reporting deaths, adding pressure to an already stretched health sector that has battled the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently weighed down by the strike by resident doctors which is now in its second week.\n\nOn Saturday, the Katsina State Government confirmed that it had recorded over 60 Cholera deaths.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have over 1,400 confirmed cases of cholera with over 60 recorded deads,\u201d the Katsina State Commissioner for Health, Yakubu Danja, said during the 2021 Annual General Meeting of the State chapter of Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) held in the state capital.\n\nThe NCDC in its report advised Nigerians to visit a health facility immediately if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cCholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately,\u201d it warned.",

Nigeria alone accounts for 11 per cent of unregistered children in West Africa.\n\nThe statement read that as Nigeria joins the rest of the World in commemorating Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Day on Tuesday, addressing structural, normative and operational challenges to birth registration should be on the front burner.\n\nThe statement emphasized that birth registration is a one-off event that gives every child a unique identity which will give them better access to vital services like health, education, and social protection.\n\nThe statement quoted the UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative, Peter Hawkins, to have said: \u201cEvery child counts \u2013 and we must ensure that we count every child, so that they can best benefit from important services like health and education,\u201d while stressing that: \u201cWe need to work together to ensure effective coordination to make this happen. Functional systems that allow for the sharing of data across information management databases that are integrated with other vital services are necessary to push the birth registration rate in Nigeria up, and make sure every child is counted.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Population Council (NPC) has identified information and communication technology assets to support effective CRVS systems that are integrated with other governmental systems, such as health and identity management, to ensure the highest standards of data protection and confidentiality of personal data to promote birth registration among civil registration, health, and identity management systems.\n\nHawkins said. \u201cEvery child has a right to a name, a nationality and a legal identity,\u201d noting that: \u201cWorking together, we can and must bring Nigeria to meeting its SDG obligation to provide a legal identify for all, including through birth registration.\u201d\n\nThe statement revealed that the NPC, in partnership with Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) entities, and with support from UNICEF, co-created a Roadmap for Digital Universal Birth Registration in Nigeria, which laid out a clear vision, delineates the roles of different government agencies, builds the government\u2019s capacity to deliver, formulates an action plan, sets a timetable and milestones, and optimizes the cost of the digital birth registration process in the country.\n\nAll of this is in advance of the implementation deadline of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which targets 16.9 calls for governments, by 2030, to provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\n\nThe statement stressed that the indicator for the target is the \u201cproportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

He was charged with espionage in June last year and went to trial in March.\n\nBarton said a court in the northeastern city of Dandong, on a river bordering North Korea, is expected to announce a verdict on Spavor on Wednesday.\n\nAnother Canadian, former diplomat Michael Kovrig, was also arrested in China days after Meng\u2019s arrest and charged with espionage. His trial was conducted in March. His embassy had no news about when he would be sentenced.\n\nChinese courts have a conviction rate of more than 99%.\n\nSome observers have said the likely convictions of both Spavor and Kovrig could ultimately facilitate an agreement in which they are released and sent back to Canada.\n\nSince Meng\u2019s arrest, China has sentenced at least three Chinese-born Canadians to death for drugs offences \u2013 Fan Wei here in April 2019, and Ye Jianhui and Xu Weihong here in August last year.",
