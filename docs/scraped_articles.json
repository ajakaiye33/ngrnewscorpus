          "text": ".\n\nA team of inspectors from the National Board for Technical Education, (NBTE) were at the Hajj House Abuja for a two-day statutory Resource Visit and Institutional Accreditation.\n\nThe exercise was among the processes of granting approval for the licensing of new institutions such as the Hajj Institute of Nigeria (HIN), to be so-called based on the recommendation of the delegation.\n\nHIN has written to the NBTE requesting approval to function as an Innovation Enterprise Institute (IEI) and a Vocational Enterprise Institution (VEI) for the award of National Innovation Diploma (NID) and National Vocational Certificate (NVC)\n\nDuring a reception organized in appreciation of the visiting team, the NAHCON Chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan emphasized that the goal of the institute was to professionalize the Hajj industry as to be a reference point in Hajj management studies from all over the world, especially English-speaking countries.\n\nHe promised full cooperation to the team, expressing confidence that their names will be preserved in the actualization of this historical movement.\n\nAlhaji Abdullahi Magaji Hardawa said HIN was one among many projects on stream introduced by the Commission to broaden NAHCON\u2019s revenue as well as to standardize Hajj operations, describing the idea of the institute as revolutionary.\n\nSpeaking at the reception, Alhaji Nura Hassan Yakassai disclosed that at the inception of the fourth board, the leadership had three immediate goals in sight: to commence the Hajj Savings scheme, to establish the HIN and to enter Public-Private Partnership for the utilization of NAHCON\u2019s landed properties. The Commissioner aired satisfaction that all the three goals are manifesting as realities. The most important vision of the HIN, he re-echoed was to educate Hajj managers with rudimentary knowledge to make operations more successful.\n\nIn the same vein, Sheikh Suleiman Momoh thanked the Almighty for the opportunity of realizing the set targets, while Dr Bala Muhammad, Board Member representing Ja\u2019matu Nasril Islam stated that the establishment of the institute might engender effective government regulation, adding that only persons with at least diploma in Hajj management would be allowed to practice in the Hajj and Umrah sector, to sanitize the system as was done in the practice of journalism in Nigeria.\n\nAt the customary exit interview sequel to inspection, Dr Nasiru Halilu Koko, leader of the delegation made observations and recommendations that will enhance productivity of the institute. He assured the gathering that the team had compiled all the information it needed and will make its submission to the relevant authority on whose shoulder lies the responsibility of taking the final decision on licensing of the Hajj institute.\n\nInterim Rector of the institution, Prof Muhammad Nasir Maiturare, thanked the delegation for their valuable recommendations and kind observations. He assured that the institute\u2019s management will take immediate steps to address the matters raised.\n\nFG gives nod to NAHCON\u2019s property devt under PPP arrangement\n\nIn another development, the NAHCON Chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, at the event, disclosed that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday, 15th of December 2021 approved NAHCON\u2019s property development under the Public-Private Partnership arrangement for commercial purposes.\n\nIt was gathered that goodwill messages and accolades from stakeholders across the country greeted the announcement of the approval by the NAHCON chairman.\n\nWith this approval, NAHCON is on course to develop its properties into money-making ventures, dividends of which will strengthen the commitment to depend less on the federal government for funding. Additionally, the Chairman explained that NAHCON would be able to subsidize Hajj for Nigerian intending pilgrims by the time all its properties become fully commercialized.\n\nThe venture is expected to generate surplus revenue for NAHCON and the federal government as well.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Opinion: Treating Christmas with respect",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Abdul Malik Mujahid\n\nChristmas is an annual Christian religious holiday commemorating the birth of the son of God, Jesus Christ, For many Muslims who even do not celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, it becomes an issue of what stand they should take.\n\nThere have been a number of legitimate criticisms of the holiday from Muslims and non-Muslims based on theological and cultural considerations. However, this cannot be used to disregard the holiday as merely an exercise in ancient pagan practices, for instance, or excessive consumerism. Muslims have to remember that for practising Christians, Christmas really is about Jesus.\n\nProphet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was so accommodating of Christians that according to the two earliest Islamic historians, Ibn e Saad and Ibn Hisham, the Prophet even allowed a delegation of 60 Byzantine Christians from Najran in Yemen to worship in his own mosque in Madinah. Led by their bishop (Usquf), they had come to discuss a number of issues with him.\n\nWhen the time of their prayer came, they asked the Prophet\u2019s permission to perform this in the mosque. He answered, \u201cconduct your service here in the mosque. It is a place consecrated to God.\u201d\n\nGod expects us to stay away from mocking the religious beliefs of others, no matter how much we disagree with them. He says in the Quran: \u201cAnd insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides God, lest they insult God wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made fair-seeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do\u201d (Quran, 6:108).\n\nWe also have to remember that even if for many nominal Christians, the celebration is not really about participating in religious traditions, Christmas is a time for families to get together. In a number of cases it is the only time of year families get together, either because family members are scattered in different parts of the country or the world, because of communication and relationship problems, or because in America today, the family unit is becoming weaker and weaker.\n\nChristmas is a great time to relate to our neighbours. We should not forget though, that \u201crelating\u201d does not mean \u201cpreaching\u201d. Dawa cannot be made in a rude manner. Allah says in the Quran: \u201cInvite (all) to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful advice, and reason with them by ways that are the best and most gracious: because your Lord knows best, (those) who have strayed from His Path, and those who receive guidance \u201c (Quran, 16:125).\n\nIn particular, when dealing with Jews and Christians, Allah says: \u201cDo not argue with the People of the Book unless it is in the politest manner, except for those of them who do wrong. Say: \u2018We believe in what has been sent down to us and what has been sent down to you. Our God and your God is [the same] One, and we are Muslims before Him\u2019\u201d (Quran, 29:46).\n\nThis may not be an occasion to emphasise the differences as much as the commonality of our beliefs unless someone is really asking you about them.\n\nA starting point for a discussion about Christmas could be the Islamic belief in all Books revealed by Allah and all Prophets sent by Him. In this discussion, special emphasis could be made on Prophet Jesus. Non-Muslims are often surprised to discover that Muslims also believe in this noble Prophet and his great mother Mary (peace be upon her).\n\nRemember that respect does not mean compromise. This article is not asking you to compromise anything. You have freedom of religion given by God to believe in what you believe in. But in a world where conflict is increasing, a Muslim should be a bridge-builder and a peacemaker. It was due to the Muslim practice of Islamic ideals of respect and tolerance that the key of the holiest Christian Shrine in Jerusalem, the church of the Holy Sepulcher, remains entrusted with a Muslim family, as it has been for over 1400 years.\n\nThese are the lessons which need to be learned by those extremists who attack Christians during their worship in Nigeria and those extremists who burn Masjids in the USA\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "* Says with new hardware, military more prepared to flush out terrorists\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said his administration would support families of dead and wounded soldiers, and help them realise their potential. Buhari stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when he addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nIn a related development, the president stated that with the acquisition of more capability in military technology and hardware, the country was better prepared to deal with terrorists, especially in the North-east. Buhari gave the assurance on yesterday in Maiduguri after inaugurating some projects donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nBuhari, who addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base, said the military had almost eliminated completely insurgency and other security issues threatening the country. He urged men of Operation Hadin Kai, the military operation against insurgency in the North-east, to remain steadfast as they went into the final phase of the campaign against terrorism and other criminalities.\n\nHe urged them to stay focused \u201cto achieve our strategic end-state, which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North-east geo-political zone and other parts of the country, where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment.\u201d\n\nThe president told the soldiers that the whole country remained grateful to them for their gallantry in ensuring the gradual return of peace to the North-east. He condoled with families that had lost loved ones, as well as the wounded.\n\nBuhari assured the families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the country, and the injured that the federal government would cater for their needs, in recognition of their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nHe asserted before the troops, \u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country. Your career is like no other, because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others. I am, therefore, here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu, and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021. I do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and, indeed, the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the troops for their extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces are known for. Well done. Our country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterised by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people, who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes. Further to the reorganisations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the threat posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the president said substantial resources had been directed to procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal. He said similar attention was being given to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari told the troops that at the onset of his administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force. This was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimise the mutual gains for our respective national security,\u201d Buhari told the troops.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North-east region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region. I am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHe assured the people that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders, including friendly nations and civil society organisations, to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nWhile appreciating the government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the federal government in multiple spheres, the president added, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the federal government and states.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence staff, service chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation, which continues to enhance operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the research and development exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s annual conference and the launch of locally constructed seaward defence ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander-in-Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices, which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible.\u201d\n\nBuhari also said the manpower challenges, which had limited the rotation of some units from the theatre, would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.\n\nIn a related development, Buhari assured that hard times awaited terrorists troubling the North-west, with the procurement of high-tech equipment and hardware by the military.\n\nHe also said he would continue to do his best for the development of the country until May 2023, when he would statutorily leave the presidency.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday in Maiduguri after the inauguration of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre, and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi, he expressed concern at the level of insecurity in the North West zone.\n\nHe said it was sad that the people of the North-west, who prior to now lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time, would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nBuhari said, \u201c I know I swore by the constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country, and we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North-east but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar, which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state for the work he had done in two years, and said he was in the state in June to commission development projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum appreciated the president for honouring the state, adding that Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c the governor said.\n\nZulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nSpeaking also, Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olori Naomi, Ooni of Ife\u2019s Wife, Announces Divorce from Monarch",
          "text": "Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nWife of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, Olori Naomi Silekunola, yesterday, announced her separation from the monarch, citing many personal reasons.\n\nIn a statement posted on her verified Instagram handle and Facebook account, in the morning, Naomi announced an end to the three-year marriage.\n\nAlthough the palace, which earlier maintained silence, came back to say divorce being a two-way thing, could not be announced by a party, even though there was an unconfirmed account, which disputed the claims of the Olori as untrue.\n\nAt the same time, a Yoruba interest group, Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, has described the development as a sacrilege to the royal stool of of Ife and the entire Yoruba race urging the people of Yoruba to remain calm and resolute to the cause of preserving the sacredness of the tradition and unique value of the throne of the Ooni of Ife.\n\nBut, according to the queen, she had tried to make the union work, unfortunately, the monarch\u2019s public identity was at variance with \u201chis true self\u201d.\n\nThe fair-skinned ex-queen wrote: \u201cI did my best to endure and make it work. Many times, I smiled through the struggle, but I have finally realised I had just one assignment: my son, and when God is done, He is done. He chose Saul to be king, and when He was done, He told the prophet Samuel I have moved on.\n\n\u201cReligion was never an issue between us; please refer to my interview on News Central TV. Instead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self.\u201d\n\nShe, therefore, declared: \u201cToday, I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter. Today, I am a mother to God\u2019s unique gift. I am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection. I, at this moment, announce that I shall no longer be referred to as wife to the Ooni of Ife or as Queen of Ile-Ife, but as the Queen of the people and mother of my adorable Prince.\u201d\n\nAlso addressing some allegations, Silekunola said her \u201cdecision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen\u201d, but added that, \u201cAs many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered from a palace source that up to the time of filing this report, the palace neither denied nor confirmed the true position of the situation, thus putting a doubt on the other account which dismissed the divorce announcement as untrue.\n\nInterestingly, Naomi\u2019s divorce makes it the second since Ooni assumed the prestigious stool. Ooni, on assuming the throne of his fathers, married Olori Wuraola Zaynab Otiti, who left in 2017.\n\nBut the palace image maker, Moses Olafare, who initially declined calls, later said separation was a two way affair and not something announced by one party.\n\nHe said the announcements of separation is subject to agreement by both parties, so, to that extent, the palace was not aware of such separation, because \u201cwe all went to bed last night having the king and queen being together.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo, if by this morning, the queen went to her social media to write that she is no longer in marriage with Ooni, we will look into it to see whether or not the Instagram page truly belongs to her, and to know the reason behind it.\n\n\u201cBut, as at today \u2013 this moment \u2013 the palace is not aware of the separation. Marriage is a private affair, no matter how prominent the personalities involved, it is a private affair. We will dig deeper and know what happened. But, like I said, all of us just woke up to read about the separation on social media.\n\n\u201cEven by this time yesterday, (Wednesday) kabiyesi was still packaging special gift for her. If you want to separate with someone, you cannot be packaging gift for her. I was aware that Kabiyesi was putting special gift for her for Christmas.\n\n\u201cIf he is not in love with her, he cannot be doing that, only to wake up the following morning to hear from public that she was no longer in the relationship. In fact the Christmas gift has been delivered to her already,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, an umbrella body for the Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and Yoruba Council of Women Worldwide, alongside all her affiliated groups, said it was \u201caghast to read just like millions of people from all works of life on the verified pages of social media platforms belonging to Olori Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi\u2019s Facebook and Instagram handle declaring herself divorced and separated with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe group, in a statement by its President, Aare Oladotun Hassan, said, while her action had caused monumental embarrassment to the throne, \u201cthe Yoruba race and all lovers of the Ooni globally, we deplore this most condemnable act of disrespect aimed at devaluing the age-long tradition of the Arole Oduduwa Olofin Adimula throne.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the throne had its modus operandi and thorough orderly guiding principles, wherein it is totally unheard of for an Olori Ooni to frivolously and peremptory announce her divorce on the pages of the social media.\n\n\u201cWe have a tradition in Yorubaland that respects and values the woman, however, it seems the Olori failed to realise that being married to the Ooni estopped a woman from public display of tantrums and ridiculous misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\u201cWe are firmly pleading with His Imperial Majesty, Kabiyesi Ooni to look beyond the current travails and obstacles as a passing wind, see the bigger picture of how all of us from diverse backgrounds support and express our unending love for His Majesty.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, The Ooni of Ife, is an embodiment of God\u2019s love for humanity.

          "text": "Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari has entered into a controversial deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to keep some Turkey-linked companies in Nigeria under surveillance.\n\nThis, according to a report by AfricaReport, is to gain the support of the Turkish government in terms of infrastructure and military assistance, particularly with the rate of insecurity in the country.\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria and Turkey were embroiled in a diplomatic row.\n\nThe Turkish President, who had just survived a coup and assassination attempt at the time, was on a mission to expose and arrest all those behind the attack that claimed 300 lives.\n\nHe claimed the coup plotters were linked to the Gulen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish businessman and influential cleric who is in exile in the United States.\n\nGulen, a former ally of Erdogan, repeatedly denied the allegations as he also claimed that he didn\u2019t know 99% of the members of his influential movement which boasts of three to six million members worldwide.\n\nErdogan made attempts to extradite Gulen from the US but failed and started reaching out to several African leaders with a view to shutting all businesses linked to the Gulen movement in their countries.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Hakan Cakil, called on Nigeria to close 17 Turkish schools in the country with ties to the Gulen movement.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the Nigerian government to close down the schools\u2026 I have requested officially, both orally and in writing, the closure of these schools.\n\n\u201cAlso, I have sent a letter to Mr Geoffrey Onyeama (foreign minister) and Mr Abba Kyari (chief of staff to the president) about this subject and requested their support for the closure of the schools,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from schools, several institutions affected included hospitals and other establishments.\n\nHowever, considering that Nigeria was facing one of its worst economic downturns ever at the time, the government was reluctant to honour such a request.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said the request would not be considered until the Turkish government provided satisfactory evidence.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unfavourable response further infuriated the Turkish government as several Nigerian students attending Turkish schools abroad were arrested while others were deported for reasons never stated.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s adviser on Diaspora Affairs at the time, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, confirmed to local media that \u201cthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the permanent secretary summoned the Turkish Ambassador immediately the information was received.\n\n\u201cWhile both countries are working at resolving the issue through every possible diplomatic channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made it clear that such acts against Nigerians will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nConsequently, businesses that were linked to Gulen in Nigeria began removing Turkey from their business names and rebranded completely although they maintained their Turkish orientation.\n\nSome of these companies include the Nigerian Turkish International College (NTIC) with branches in Kaduna, Abuja, Kano, Yobe, Ogun and Lagos. The school changed its name to Nigerian Tulip International School.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Turkish Nile University changed its name to Nile University. The Nigeria Turkish Nizamiye Hospital which was patronised by Nigeria\u2019s elite was simply changed to Nizamiye Hospital.\n\nDespite these moves, however, Turkey remained adamant.\n\nIn 2019, the new Turkey Ambassador to Nigeria, Melih Ulueren, said at an event in commemoration of the third year anniversary of the coup that the Turkish Maarif Foundation had been set up to take over all business interests linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nWith Turkey unable to take over the business interests of the Gulen movement in Nigeria, Erdogan decided to take a new approach and give Nigeria an offer that would be difficult to refuse.\n\nWith the surge in insecurity in recent times and its many facets including banditry, terrorism, kidnapping among others, the Nigerian government is in desperate need for weapons and intelligence, also, considering the impending arms embargo by the United States Congress due to human rights concerns, Nigeria needed to explore other options and unlike the US, Turkey would be willing to partner with Nigeria without such stringent human rights conditions.\n\nMaking a direct reference to Nigeria\u2019s security quagmire, Erdogan during his visit to Nigeria in October 2021 told President Buhari that his administration would continuously share intelligence with Nigerian authorities.\n\nHe was quick to add that those behind the attempted coup in Turkey were still very active in Nigeria and there needed to be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe sensitivity we show in fighting terrorism, I hope will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. The perpetrators of the heinous failed coup of July the 15 FETO are still very active in Nigeria. And we are continually sharing our intelligence with Nigerian interlocutors and authorities,\u201d Erdogan was quoted as saying.\n\nAs a show of good faith, Buhari immediately announced the removal of Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 red list. The Nigerian President revealed that he signed eight major agreements with Turkey on several key sectors including energy, defence industry, mining and hydrocarbons among others. Buhari also praised Erdogan for opening his country\u2019s borders to accommodate millions of refugees in dire need of humanitarian support.\n\nBuhari also recently visited Istanbul for the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit. During the visit which Presidency officials described as \u2018epic\u2019, several agreements were reached.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said in a Facebook post that Turkish technology in Nigeria will surely quicken the process and efforts to \u201crid Nigeria of pockets of terrorists and the menace of kidnappers and bandits. From their wide experience and advances in technology in fighting terrorism and banditry, they have a lot to give and they have assured us that they will give that support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Nigeria will not allow any part of our territory to be used to undermine a friendly state such as Turkey. Under our strict Central Bank and Financial Intelligence Unit\u2019s governance structure and management, money from the investments in issue cannot be moved anywhere to finance subversive activities,\u201d said Shehu.\n\nApart from Turkey\u2019s military assistance, Buhari also hopes to ensure that Erdogan would assist Nigeria to build infrastructure which has been the exclusive preserve of China.\n\nThe Marif Foundation funded by the Turkish government is also expected to build a five-star hotel and conference centre, schools and a world-class hospital in Abuja.",

          "text": "Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari has entered into a controversial deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to keep some Turkey-linked companies in Nigeria under surveillance.\n\nThis, according to a report by AfricaReport, is to gain the support of the Turkish government in terms of infrastructure and military assistance, particularly with the rate of insecurity in the country.\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria and Turkey were embroiled in a diplomatic row.\n\nThe Turkish President, who had just survived a coup and assassination attempt at the time, was on a mission to expose and arrest all those behind the attack that claimed 300 lives.\n\nHe claimed the coup plotters were linked to the Gulen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and led by Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish businessman and influential cleric who is in exile in the United States.\n\nGulen, a former ally of Erdogan, repeatedly denied the allegations as he also claimed that he didn\u2019t know 99% of the members of his influential movement which boasts of three to six million members worldwide.\n\nErdogan made attempts to extradite Gulen from the US but failed and started reaching out to several African leaders with a view to shutting all businesses linked to the Gulen movement in their countries.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, the Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Hakan Cakil, called on Nigeria to close 17 Turkish schools in the country with ties to the Gulen movement.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the Nigerian government to close down the schools\u2026 I have requested officially, both orally and in writing, the closure of these schools.\n\n\u201cAlso, I have sent a letter to Mr Geoffrey Onyeama (foreign minister) and Mr Abba Kyari (chief of staff to the president) about this subject and requested their support for the closure of the schools,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from schools, several institutions affected included hospitals and other establishments.\n\nHowever, considering that Nigeria was facing one of its worst economic downturns ever at the time, the government was reluctant to honour such a request.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said the request would not be considered until the Turkish government provided satisfactory evidence.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unfavourable response further infuriated the Turkish government as several Nigerian students attending Turkish schools abroad were arrested while others were deported for reasons never stated.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s adviser on Diaspora Affairs at the time, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, confirmed to local media that \u201cthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the permanent secretary summoned the Turkish Ambassador immediately the information was received.\n\n\u201cWhile both countries are working at resolving the issue through every possible diplomatic channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made it clear that such acts against Nigerians will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nConsequently, businesses that were linked to Gulen in Nigeria began removing Turkey from their business names and rebranded completely although they maintained their Turkish orientation.\n\nSome of these companies include the Nigerian Turkish International College (NTIC) with branches in Kaduna, Abuja, Kano, Yobe, Ogun and Lagos. The school changed its name to Nigerian Tulip International School.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Turkish Nile University changed its name to Nile University. The Nigeria Turkish Nizamiye Hospital which was patronised by Nigeria\u2019s elite was simply changed to Nizamiye Hospital.\n\nDespite these moves, however, Turkey remained adamant.\n\nIn 2019, the new Turkey Ambassador to Nigeria, Melih Ulueren, said at an event in commemoration of the third year anniversary of the coup that the Turkish Maarif Foundation had been set up to take over all business interests linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nWith Turkey unable to take over the business interests of the Gulen movement in Nigeria, Erdogan decided to take a new approach and give Nigeria an offer that would be difficult to refuse.\n\nWith the surge in insecurity in recent times and its many facets including banditry, terrorism, kidnapping among others, the Nigerian government is in desperate need for weapons and intelligence, also, considering the impending arms embargo by the United States Congress due to human rights concerns, Nigeria needed to explore other options and unlike the US, Turkey would be willing to partner with Nigeria without such stringent human rights conditions.\n\nMaking a direct reference to Nigeria\u2019s security quagmire, Erdogan during his visit to Nigeria in October 2021 told President Buhari that his administration would continuously share intelligence with Nigerian authorities.\n\nHe was quick to add that those behind the attempted coup in Turkey were still very active in Nigeria and there needed to be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe sensitivity we show in fighting terrorism, I hope will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. The perpetrators of the heinous failed coup of July the 15 FETO are still very active in Nigeria. And we are continually sharing our intelligence with Nigerian interlocutors and authorities,\u201d Erdogan was quoted as saying.\n\nAs a show of good faith, Buhari immediately announced the removal of Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 red list. The Nigerian President revealed that he signed eight major agreements with Turkey on several key sectors including energy, defence industry, mining and hydrocarbons among others. Buhari also praised Erdogan for opening his country\u2019s borders to accommodate millions of refugees in dire need of humanitarian support.\n\nBuhari also recently visited Istanbul for the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit. During the visit which Presidency officials described as \u2018epic\u2019, several agreements were reached.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said in a Facebook post that Turkish technology in Nigeria will surely quicken the process and efforts to \u201crid Nigeria of pockets of terrorists and the menace of kidnappers and bandits. From their wide experience and advances in technology in fighting terrorism and banditry, they have a lot to give and they have assured us that they will give that support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Nigeria will not allow any part of our territory to be used to undermine a friendly state such as Turkey. Under our strict Central Bank and Financial Intelligence Unit\u2019s governance structure and management, money from the investments in issue cannot be moved anywhere to finance subversive activities,\u201d said Shehu.\n\nApart from Turkey\u2019s military assistance, Buhari also hopes to ensure that Erdogan would assist Nigeria to build infrastructure which has been the exclusive preserve of China.\n\nThe Marif Foundation funded by the Turkish government is also expected to build a five-star hotel and conference centre, schools and a world-class hospital in Abuja.",

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Federal Government on Wednesday destroyed over 1m doses of Astrazeneca vaccines donated to combat COVID-19.\n\nThe Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, led the destruction at Gosa Dumpsite, about 2km from the Idu Railway Station, Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe withdrew about 1,066,214, doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines from across the country,\u201d he said\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria(NAN), reports that Nigeria joined other African countries, like Malawi, South Sudan, Liberia, Mauritania, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Comoros, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in destroying the expired COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cAs you can see these vaccines have now been deposited by the Abuja Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cWe have come through in our promise to all Nigerians to be transparent in our delivery of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines did not expire before we took the decision to withdraw them. Today is an opportunity for Nigerians to have further faith in our vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cWe worked with our sister agency, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who took that decision to destroy these vaccines at the point that they got expired.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is the work that requires trust. It is a sacred trust that has been bestowed on us by the generalizing generality of Nigerians and hold that trust to be true,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the heroes of today\u2019s activity were actually the frontline health workers.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, when these vaccines were offered to us, we knew that they had a short shelf life. But we were living in an environment where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines were very scarce.\n\n\u201cThey were not available due to vaccine nationalism. Some developed countries that procured these vaccines, hoarded them in their stores,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended members of staff of the NPHCDA who worked Saturdays or Sundays on very extreme situations to make sure that Nigerians have access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe were able to vaccinate over 10 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo my heart and my pride goes out to those frontline health workers that continue to work around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe still have short shelf life vaccines in the country. They are still potent.\n\n\u201cThey have not reached the end of use dates and the health workers are still going around every communities and settlement to ensure Nigerians are vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThis decision has saved Nigeria over 40 million dollars,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr. Mojisola Adeyeye, noted that Nigeria was the only country with a unique immunization programme.\n\n\u201cNigeria has one of the best vaccination immunization program in the world. UNICEF mentioned this last year. But we started this journey months before the vaccines came.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we are witnessing today. It is a continuous unfolding of the fact that the best is for all Nigerians, because Nigerians deserve the best in terms of quality of medicines, vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeyeye added that this was the basis of the endless meetings between NPHCDA and NAFDAC.

Gbadebo Badru, said the most important thing to do was to ensure that Oyetola is re-elected.\n\n\u201cWe have seen several things that Oyetola has done for us. I want to assure you that everything you have been told Oyetola will still do, he will do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have started again. They want to suffer us in Iwoland like they did in 2018. We won\u2019t allow it to happen anymore.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Moshood Adeoti was Secretary to the State Government for eight years, Iwo-Osogbo road was completely abandoned. He was also the Chairman, Tenders Board for eight years, overseeing all government contracts, he couldn\u2019t do anything about our road.\n\n\u201cAdeoti did not resign or leave the party until he was denied governorship ticket. That is because of his selfish interest. But we won\u2019t allow him lead us astray in Iwoland. It won\u2019t happen anymore.\n\n\u201cIwo Federal Constituency has decided. We are standing with Oyetola. Adeoti should go and calm down and not bring bad things to us in Iwoland.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all calm down. After Oyetola, then we can talk about West by the Grace of God,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso addressing the party faithful and supporters at the event, Dr. Amidu Tadese, a former Chief Whip of the State Assembly in 1992 and serving Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, noted that Oyetola is a governor that loves Iwoland, adding that members of The Osun Progressives, TOP were in government for eight years when the State was bouyant but did not play any major role in Iwoland.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe only road that Aregbesola claimed to do in Iwo was done by Kamorudeen Alao\u2019s LG administration.\n\n\u201cOyetola has started works on Lawyer Atanda road. After that, he will do Odoori to Adeeke and two other major roads.\n\n\u201cIn the last 7 months, Oyetola has been sending us food monthly. Apart from that, our water works was established in 1952. Since then, it has been abandoned. Now, Oyetola has awarded the contract for its rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cSome people were there for 8 years, they couldn\u2019t do anything. Now, they are back.

He is a good man. I have spoken with him a couple of times; he is a good person. We need a good man like Osinbajo at the helm of affairs of this country \u2013 someone people can learn from; someone people of goodwill share a common conviction with. He has this great passion for the country and I want other Nigerians to emulate his passion for the good of our country.\n\n\u201cWe want other Nigerians to emulate this passion. I am always available to share my experience about the country.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that politicians should always have a vision for a united and great Nigeria as a shining example of democracy in the continent. He also hailed the convener of the group for their convictions and belief about the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBabangida urged the group not to relent in seeking a prosperous Nigeria, urging other groups to learn from the organisation.\n\nSpeaking further, he said politicians had a lot to learn from the organisation.\n\n\u201cI believe you have experience with politicians already and we will follow you based on this conviction that you have about this country.\n\n\u201cI pray you grow this body so that people will speak well of you, and I pray other organisations will learn from you.\n\n\u201cWith constant engagement, there are people who can bring about positive change in this country. Please stay on course and I know things will be much better than now.\u201d\n\nHe also urged the group to convey his best wishes to the vice president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn his part, the national convener, OGO, Ojo Sylvanus Folusho, praised Babangida for believing in the dreams of the group. He also hailed him for endorsing Osinbajo as president ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to consult former military president Ibrahim Babangida and you hear him clearly. Babangida described Osinbajo as a passionate leader that can move the country forward to the greater heights we are expecting.\n\n\u201cBabangida is a resolute leader and he has given us his word and we should convey his best wishes to the vice president. He also told us to continue our conviction for a better Nigeria and we will continue to preach the gospel of Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that the VP will accept to run for 2023 president. We have been in this struggle for two, three years and we are happy about this endorsement.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the leader of the delegation, Chief Emma Ejiofor, said the group started as a small group of like-minds and patriots.\n\nEjiofor said the group discovered that Nigeria\u2019s problem is poor political leadership which has affected economic leadership.\n\nAs 2023 approaches, he said the group decided to build a structure on a solid foundation.\n\n\u201cWe defer first to you, the biggest masquerade himself. Even though we have not discussed with Osinbajo to run, we believe if the call is coming from a legend like you, he will get the message clear and be convinced to run for the 2023 election,\u201d he added.",

The costs are $65,606,420, \u20ac15,152,651 and N31,360,272,397 respectively.\n\nSpeaking on the memo he presented, Aliyu stated: \u201cToday, I presented to council 16 memos, which I seek for council\u2019s approval and the council graciously approved all of them. At this point, let me say what these approvals will do to the nation\u2019s electricity supply. \u201cAs we\u2019re all aware, the major problem we\u2019re having in the Electricity Supply Industry is to be able to evacuate sufficient electricity and distribute them. That is to say, we have a very weak transmission grid and distribution segment of the value chain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe may not be having much problem with generation. So, unless we\u2019re able to strengthen the electricity grid, which is nationwide, and to expand, and to be able to evacuate, what the grid can take to consumers, we will have a lot of problems ahead of us.\n\n\u201cSo, what we\u2019re doing currently through various and several interventions is to be able to repair the grid by constructing new transmission lines, bringing in new equipment to replace the old ones at our substations. So, that will release more capacity to the distribution and to the customers.\n\n\u201cSo, the operational capacity, as you all know now is hovering around 5,000 megawatts and the transmission and distribution.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Maiduguri, Borno State, urged troops of Operation Hadin Kai to remain steadfast as they go into the final phase of the campaign against insurgency and other forms of criminalities.\n\nThe President, who addressed the troops at the Airforce Base in Maiduguri, Borno State capital, said the entire nation remains grateful for the gallantry displayed in ensuring gradual return of peace to the North-East, while condoling with families that have lost loved ones, and the wounded.\n\n\u201cI urge you also to stay focused to achieve our strategic end-state which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North East Geo-political Zone and other parts of the Country where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari assured families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the nation and the injured that the Federal Government will cater for their needs, recognising their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country.\n\n\u201cYour career is like no other because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others.\n\n\u201cI am therefore here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and indeed the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the Government would continue to ensure that the widows and children of fallen heroes were well catered for, to help them fully realise their potentials.\n\nThe President noted that the response exhibited across the theatre had shown extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces is known for. Well done.\n\n\u201cOur country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterized by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes.\n\n\u201cFurther to the reorganizations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead,\u201d the President added.\n\nWhile noting threats posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), he said substantial resources have also been directed at procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, similar attention is being given to Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the Theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the troops that at the onset of the administration he emphasized the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force, which was in realization of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimize the mutual gains for our respective national security.\n\n\u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North East Region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region.\n\n\u201cI am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy,\u201d he added.\n\nHe assured that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders including friendly nations, civil society organizations as well as other credible non-governmental organizations to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed deep appreciation to the Government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the Federal Government in multiple spheres.\n\nAdding, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the State.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the Federal Government and states.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Service Chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation which continues to enhance operations.\n\n\u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the Research and Development Exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s Annual Conference and the launch of locally constructed Seaward Defence Ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander in Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur Government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible,\u201d the President assured.\n\nThe President stated that the manpower challenges which have limited the rotation of some units from the Theatre would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.",

Nigeria wants good leaders. This will be someone who is ready to sacrifice so many things for the country. There will be a lot that will surround who will become the next president of Nigeria. The person will not be too old or too young. The person will have a clean bill of health from scandals. Of course, the Igbo will find it difficult and tough. They will come up with propaganda in order to keep them in the race.\n\n\u201cIn the 2023 election, Nigeria will want to pick the best candidate. The Northern states will be divided; some will support the South while some people will support the North. Governors from the Southern states will not speak with one voice. The Governors will be divided on personal grounds.\n\n\u201cAPC and PDP will do everything possible to reach consensus so that it won\u2019t cause problems. The pattern of the Southerners will be very firm while that of the Easterners will be very weak. They will make moves but they won\u2019t achieve their expected desires. Of course, the two leading parties will make bold moves that will make the 3rd party re-strategizes their plans.\n\n\u2018\u2019I foresee that whoever wins the 2023 election will be given the mandate freely given by the electorate. The spirit of God says Buhari is ready to handover and will not interfere or dabble into the affairs of who becomes the next President. The government and the Electoral Umpire will do what is right and this will make Buhari to be honoured. There is no doubt, there will be smooth transition and whoever is announced by INEC will not be removed by any court.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile making this prophetic revelation, the man of God referred to some politicians who are likely to join the presidential race.\n\nHe mentioned the likes of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Omoyele Sowore, Kingsley Moghalu, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and several others.",

The President should therefore ignore all dissident and retrogressive exhortations aimed at dissuading him from signing the bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe affirm our conviction in the direct primary procedure as it will allow only politicians who are truly popular at the grassroot level to emerge as party candidates.\n\n\u201cHowever, we also concur that political parties should be able to unilaterally determine their choice of technique in line with their respective ideologies.\u201d",

This is the result of a mix of very low vaccination coverage, increased travels and movements, reduced compliance to public health social measures and highly transmissible Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant now circulating in the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt further added that \u201cindoor religious congregation should be limited to 50 percent capacity with full compliance to public health social measures; face masks and hand sanitizers should be used at all times regardless of vaccination status while in public spaces.\n\n\u201cFamilies are advised to limit the number of visitors to their homes and put in place precautionary safety measures. Any gathering in the excess of 50 people should be done in open spaces with physical distancing.\n\n\u201cAvoid non-essential interstate travel at this period as this increases the risk of spreading infection from one place to another. People who intend to travel are encouraged to take a rapid COVID-19 test to confirm status as many infected persons are asymptomatic.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you have taken the full dose of COVID-19 vaccination including the booster dose to reduce your risk of severe infection and death in case of exposure to COVID-19.\u201d",

I am therefore here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021.\n\n\u201cI do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno state and indeed the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nHe said government would continue to ensure that the widows and children of fallen heroes were well catered for to help them fully realise their potentials.\n\nThe president said the response exhibited across the theatre had shown extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\n\u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces is known for. Well done.\n\n\u201cOur country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterized by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes.\n\n\u201cFurther to the reorganizations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting the threats posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the President said substantial resources have also been directed at procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal.\n\nHe said a similar attention is being given to Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the Theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also told the troops that at the onset of the administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force, which was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimize the mutual gains for our respective national security.\n\n\u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North East Region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region.\n\n\u201cI am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno state, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari assured that the present administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders including friendly nations, civil society organizations as well as other credible non-governmental organizations to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nExpressing appreciation to Borno state government, the president said: \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state. I particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno.\n\n\u201cYours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the Federal Government and states.\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence, the Chief of Defence Staff, Service Chiefs and the heads of other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation which continues to enhance operations.\n\n\u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the Research and Development Exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s Annual Conference and the launch of locally constructed Seaward Defence Ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander in Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible,\u201d he said.",

No- AG157EKY.\u201d\n\nHe added that these two had four Nigerian accomplices who are already embedded in the country.\n\nIntelligence gathered by the NIS suggests that Ali holds an Algerian diplomatic passport with the name Najim Ould Ibrahim.\n\nConsequently, the NIS Commander, who wrote on behalf of the Comptroller General, said he has been directed to request an intensifying of alert levels at the borders.\n\nAll operatives in charge were urged to emplace necessary countermeasures at all the nation\u2019s entry and exit points (Air, Land, Sea/Marine), including, but not limited to, surveillance, rigorous search on persons and vehicles, transhumance, to effectuate the immediate arrest of these terrorists as to countervail this and any terrorist attacks in Abuja.\n\nThe NIS\u2019s warning comes a few weeks after the Department of State Services (DSS) raised an alarm over plans by terrorists to attack military bases in border towns across the country.\n\nThe secret agency also put the Nigeria Customs Service on red alert to avert the pending attacks by the insurgents on Ogun border communities and other border towns across the country, noting that the warning is based on intelligence it gathered.\n\nIn a leaked memo dated November 25, 2021, and addressed to the Customs Area Controller, Nigeria Customs Service, Ogun Area Command, Abeokuta, the DSS advised customs and other security agencies in the country to put counter-measures in place to frustrate the plot by the insurgents.\n\nAccording to the leaked document which was titled, \u2018Plans By Insurgents To Launch Attacks On Military Bases In Various Border Communities,\u2019 the planned attacks are to be carried out simultaneously on military posts and bases in various border communities across the nation.\n\nThe letter signed by the State Director of Security, Ogun State Command, M.B. Abdullahi, did not specify exactly when the attacks will take place but the indications were that it was imminent.\n\nDSS further noted that in view of the foregoing and the likelihood, such attacks are not limited to the military personnel only.\n\nThe agency advised all law enforcement and security agencies with operational bases at border communities to take note of the threat and emplace countermeasures with emphasis on the personal security of operatives to frustrate the planned attack.",

A. Egwuata, praying for an order for the final forfeiture of the 60 buildings and a 9.6-hectare plot of land, both located at Sabon-Lugbe South-West Extension, Airport Road, Abuja, alleged to have been acquired by Bintu through corrupt means.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari\u2019s Critic, Ortom Backs President\u2019s Refusal To Sign Amended Electoral Bill\n\nCounsel to ICPC, John-Paul Okwor, told the court that the Commission was relying on Section 48 (1) (2) and (3) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, which gives it power to approach the courts to forfeit properties corruptly acquired by individuals.\n\nThe Commission had argued before the court that the former NSCDC Deputy Commandant, set up a private company, Faith Winners Victory Properties Limited, through which she allegedly perpetrated the fraud by selling plots of land to unsuspecting members of the public.\n\nThe court heard that Bintu claimed that the land, which she used to dupe over 1000 people that subscribed into the estate business, was owned in partnership with NSCDC.\n\nHowever, the subscribers, who had made several payments running into millions of naira, were never allocated plots of land nor had their funds returned to them by Bintu and her company.\n\nFurthermore, ICPC proved before the court that Bintu, who had jumped bail and is now a fugitive, did not enter into any partnership with NSCDC to build estates for members of the public.\n\nShe told the court in her argument that ICPC had no powers to prosecute civil cases and that Sections 6 and 48 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, relied upon by the Commission have been repealed by the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2003. Therefore, the case should be struck out, she prayed.\n\nHer arguments were dismissed by the court for lack of merit, and Justice Egwuata then ruled that all the 60 buildings and the 9.6 hectares of land situated at Sabon-Lugbe South-West Extension, Airport Road, Abuja, listed by ICPC be forfeited to the federal government.",

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) and the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), two critical federal government agencies investigating the recent oil blowout on an Aiteo facility in Bayelsa, have linked the leak to sabotage.\n\nDuring a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the Santa Barbara River, Nembe, both organisations agreed that the wind valve may have been tampered with by yet to be identified persons, leading to the spill.\n\nNOSDRA is the federal government agency responsible for monitoring and responding to oil spills in Nigeria and acts between oil companies and communities at the local and state level.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of State for the Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, had set up the body to ascertain the cause of the spill, the volume and impacted area.\n\nUsually, a JIV is convened by the operator of the affected facility and comprises representatives of the oil firm, affected communities, regulators and state ministry of environment.\n\nDuring the visit, a representative of the NURPC, Mr. Adetoyinbo Adeyemi, stated that physical examination of the failed wellhead from an engineering point of view indicate that the pressure from the asset was not enough to blow the well.\n\nHe argued that the wind valve which he said was designed to withstand all kinds of pressure could not have failed if it wasn\u2019t tampered with, explaining that the fact that the facility wasn\u2019t even producing at the time, made it even more improbable to suspect any other cause.\n\n\u201cWe are here to establish the cause of the incident that happened at the Santa Barbara well 1. From the findings, you can see that there\u2019s no spill anymore. Where the spill came out from is from the wind valve.\n\n\u201cThe wind valve has been replaced now. That means that the wind valve the way it was, is not designed to fail like that because there are bolts surrounding it, well designed to keep the pressure in place.\n\n\u201cSo, if it had not been taken off, there is no way it could have moved from there. When it was reported initially, there was no valve in that place and it could not be found. So, to us, it is an act of sabotage.\n\n\u201cBefore that well\u2019s assembly was designed, it was done to take care of any pressure from that well and as you know, the well had not been producing for a long time, and there was no pressure to take off the valve because they are called the barriers to ensure that such an environment where it has been installed is not affected.\n\n\u201cSo, if you are trying to compare an apple with an orange, it\u2019s going to be a wrong thing. Another thing is that if you can go back and read, you will find out the valve is not designed to fail except somebody goes there to mess it up,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso, NOSDRA\u2019s Ismail Baba-Ahmed, traced the leak to the same cause, stressing that from his expertise on fluid mechanics and his interactions with the wellhead experts who plugged the leak, only vandalism could have led to the blowout.\n\nHe explained that he gathered from the wellhead engineers that the threading on the wellhead casing where the valve was removed was not worn out, a development that suggested that the leak was not caused by pressure.\n\nThe leak which was reported on November 5, was plugged on December 8, with some 16, 000 barrels of crude and crude sediments said to have been recovered from the site.\n\nThe well, which was acquired from Shell by Aiteo has had a life of 20 years so far, but was shut in at the time the blowout happened.\n\nOfficials of the company alleged that some persons who claimed to have been on surveillance duty had been arrested earlier by security agents near the site and are currently being interrogated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The already beleaguered power sector faces even more challenges this yuletide season with severe gas shortages hitting a number of the country\u2019s electricity supply assets, THISDAY learnt Thursday.\n\nAside the breach of the Trans-Forcados pipeline, it was gathered that the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) was battling to revive its gas plant in Ughelli East which is currently down.\n\nAlready, the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC), has written some industry players intimating them of the dire development and the likely impact it would have on power supply, especially in the western axis.\n\nIn a memo dated December 20, 2021, marked Ref: NDPHC/NIPP/MD/2021 obtained yesterday, the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) alerted the Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) of the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThe official communication seen by THISDAY was signed by the Managing Director of the NDPHC, Mr. Chiedu Ugbo and was copied the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).\n\nTitled: \u201cRe: Notice Of Gas Shortage From Nigeria Gas Company,\u201d the NDPHC noted that it had been notified of the breach of the facility, coupled with other technical issues that were affecting gas supplies in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have been notified on the 18th of December 2021, by the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC), via an email (Annexure I) of a breach on their gas supply network as well as technical issues affecting gas suppliers on the western axis.\n\n\u201cThese challenges have led NGC to issue the notice of gas curtailment arising from the abysmal system pressure levels that must be managed to avoid collapse of the gas grid,\u201d the NDPHC stressed.\n\nQuoting the NGC, the NDPHC stated that the Trans-Forcados Pipeline (TFP) was breached on December 17, 2021, and had impacted Seplat\u2019s production and may further affect other producers if not immediately repaired.\n\nIt added: \u201cAlso, NGC reported that the NPDC\u2019s Ughelli East plant is currently down while Chevron Nigeria Ltd (CNL) had also lost a compressor because of technical issues.\n\n\u201cThe combined impact of all these issues is a deferment, unavailability to off-takers, of about 250MMscfd of gas from the pipeline network,\u201d the power company noted.\n\nNDPHC Limited has five of its operational power plants viz: Olorunsogo, Omotosho, Sapele, Ihovbor and Geregu, which have all been impacted by the gas curtailment.\n\nIt was learnt that while Omotosho National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) has been forced to shut down, Geregu NIPP and Ihovbor are only receiving limited gas volumes, thus leading to part load or low generation operation.\n\nHowever, in the memo, the management of NDPHC stated that it was monitoring the situation and was committed to ensuring the plants return to full operations as soon as gas supply improves.\n\nLast week, the NERC disclosed that of the country\u2019s 26 power plants, only nine supply 73 per cent of electricity generated and deployed across the nation.\n\nThe industry regulator, in its report for the fourth quarter of 2020, said that the situation was of grave concern to the sector as the convergence of generation in a few plants could destabilise supply when they encounter challenges.\n\nWhile malfunctions are a common feature in the sector, resulting in incessant blackouts, on the average, Nigeria generates roughly 4,000 megawatts for a population of over 200 million.\n\nWithin the first seven days of March, Nigeria\u2019s power sector lost about N6.8 billion to challenges related to insufficient gas supply to electricity generation companies (Gencos), while in 2020, the sector lost N1.71 billion in just one day over the challenge.\n\nIronically, Nigeria holds the largest natural gas reserves in Africa \u2014 and the ninth-largest globally, with an estimate of 206 trillion cubic feet (tcf), but with little investment, only a little is tapped.\n\nThe country\u2019s gas reserves exceed its crude oil reserves, although over the years oil has had all the attention, while the gas reserves were left to waste.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
