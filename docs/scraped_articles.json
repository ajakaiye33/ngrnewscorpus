Our peaceful disposition as a people should not be misconstrued as weakness.\n\n\u201cNigeria cannot incarcerate our leader illegally and expect things to be normal again. If by October 21, Kanu is not brought to court, Nigeria will know that Kanu commands the unflinching loyalty of over 60 million Biafrans home and in Diaspora.\n\n\u201cBy keeping our Leader out of circulation, his health will be in jeopardy and we won\u2019t allow this. The Fulani-controlled Nigeria Government must tell us why it will choose to disobey court orders and expect citizens to watch like conquered slaves.\n\n\u201cThey are busy granting amnesty to terrorists and bandits killing their soldiers and citizens but keeping peaceful agitators in perpetual detention.\n\n\u201cTheir plan is to suppress agitation and force everyone into submission but Biafrans won\u2019t succumb to their intimidation. We are a different people.\n\n\u201cTheir plan is to silence agitations for freedom as championed by Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Ighoho so that the Fulani from across Africa will overrun Nigeria. They can\u2019t conquer Biafra land as they have conquered Hausa and other indigenous tribes in Nigeria.\u201d",

This to us was unpalatable, disrespectful and should not be encouraged by any sane person.\n\n\u201cDespite the provocation, the council still went ahead and directed that some of the ASUU\u2019s demands should be met. If they wanted to have an interface with the Council, there are procedure. They shouldn\u2019t just storm the venue of their meeting.\n\n\u201cThe Council of the university is placing premium on the welfare of staff. Though ASUU had made very good and germane demands, but there are matured and civil ways by which we can ask such in a university setting\u201d, he said .\n\nOn whether the Council would wield the big stick against unruly ASUU members, the VC said: \u201cThe Council out magnanimity had decided to overlook the ASUU\u2019s action and extended hands of fellowship to them\u201d.\n\nOlanipekun clarified that the university won\u2019t tolerate any form of financial corruption under any guise, saying apart from directing alleged cases of corruption to anti- graft agencies for investigation, that the university had also constituted a committee to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cAnd we assure you that whoever committed or indicted for administrative or financial infractions will face disciplinary action, this we are assuring ASUU,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cASUU too must understand that there are rules and regulations and whoever flouts the rules would be made to face disciplinary actions\u201d.",

The federal government of Nigeria has again perfected plans not to bring him to court on that day.\n\n\u201cTheir wicked plan is to perpetually keep him behind bars without trial to see if they can demoralise him and Biafrans but they are late.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government refuses to bring him to court in his next court appearance on October 21, 2021, the entire Biafra land will be on total lock down for one month. The federal government will know that they cannot take us for granted any more. Our peaceful disposition as a people should not be misconstrued as weakness. Nigeria cannot incarcerate our leader illegally and expect things to be normal again. If by October 21, Kanu is not brought to court, Nigeria will know that Kanu commands the unflinching loyalty of over 60 million Biafrans home and in Diaspora.\n\n\u201cBy keeping our Leader out of circulation his health will be in jeopardy and we won\u2019t allow this. The Fulani-controlled Nigeria Government must tell us why it will choose to disobey court orders and expect citizens to watch like conquered slaves. They are busy granting amnesty to terrorists and bandits killing their soldiers and citizens but keeping peaceful agitators in perpetual detention.\n\n\u201cTheir plan is to suppress agitation and force everyone into submission but Biafrans won\u2019t succumb to their intimidation. We are a different people. Their plan is to silence agitations for freedom as championed by Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Ighoho so that the Fulani from across Africa will overrun Nigeria.

          "title": "11 in race for APC national chairman",
          "text": "- Advertisement -\n\nAlthough the All Progressives Congress (APC) is yet to fix a date for its national convention, no fewer than 11 chieftains are showing interest in the race to succeed Governor Mai Mala Buni as chairman of the ruling party. JIDE ORINTUNSIN examines their chances and constraints.\n\nSince the fusion of the legacy parties in 2014 gave birth to the ruling All Progressives (APC), the contest for the party\u2019s leadership positions at any level has never been this keen. The two major national conventions that produced the former National Working Committees (NWC) did not generate the kind of attention the forthcoming national convention is currently generating.\n\nBut, for the crisis that rocked the tenure of Comrade Adams Oshiomole-led NWC mid-term, a full convention to replace the executive arm of the party would have been due by June 2022. The \u201cpalace coup\u201d of June 25, 2020 by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) sacked the Oshiomhole-led NWC and saddled the responsibility of running the party on the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led 13-man Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). The committee was mandated to recognise, resolve the avalanche of the crisis rocking the party and to organize a national convention to elect a new NWC, in line with the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nAfter two extensions (of six months) were granted, the Caretaker Committee commenced the process for the emergence of a new NWC. On July 31, 2021 ward congresses were held in more than 18,000 wards throughout the country. It was followed up by the local government congress while the state congress is slated for October 2.\n\nAhead of the convention, agitation for zoning of the party positions and elective offices keeps mounting and the need for the party to honour the gentleman\u2019s agreement of power rotation between the North and the South is becoming more palpable. But, the silence from the CECPC on the modalities for the national convention has been fueling tension. Nevertheless, with what is playing out, indicatiuons are that the party has tacitly conceded to the idea of power shift.\n\nPolitical watchers said, this was informed by the array of national chairmanship aspirants, who are all from the North.\n\nInfluence of governors:\n\nOf all the blocs in the party, the state governor\u2019s forum is the most influential and the most formidable.\n\nAside from controlling the structure in their respective states, their influence on the CECPC is enormous.\n\nThis explains why virtually all the aspirants, including former governors among the chairmanship hopefuls, defer to their state governors on endorsement.\n\nAs the main financiers of the party, the governors will surely want to influence who emerged as the new national chairman.\n\nInfluence of legacy parties:\n\nAnother determinant factor is the influence of the legacy parties. Though on paper, all the legacy parties have fused into one political platform, the truth is that patronage is still based on members\u2019 affiliation to their former parties.\n\nSome elements in the defunct Congress for Positive Change (CPC) have mounted a campaign for the bloc to produce the next national chairman. They hinged their argument on the fact that other legacy parties have had a feel of the office.\n\nHow much of this will play out at the convention will surely influence the voting pattern, except a consensus arrangement is reached.\n\nRegional agitation:\n\nA group within the party, the APC Patriotic Ambassadors of Nigeria (APAN), have since last year been rooting for the micro-zoning of the national chairman to North-central. The group has persistently urged the Mala-Buni-led CECPC and the NEC to zone the chairmanship to the North-central.\n\nAdvancing reasons why the region should be favoured for the plum job, its National Coordinator, Dr. Aliyu Ibrahim said the zone is the most strategic geo-political zone with multi-cultural and multi-ethnic electoral investment opportunities.\n\nHe said: \u201cZoning the position of the national chairman to North-central will help galvanize more electoral victories for the party at both primary and secondary elections in future polls, beginning with 2023.\u201d\n\nConsensus option:\n\nThough no date has been fixed for the national convention, some political gladiators are already spoiling for action. Stakeholders in the party are however divided over the mode of election at the national convention. Some aspirants are spoiling for outright election, while some are pushing for consensus. Feelers from the party however show that the CECPC may settle for consensus.\n\nA source at the party\u2019s national secretariat told The Nation in confidence that the Buni-led committee may have settled for consensus. His words: \u201cThe emergence of John Odigie-Oyegun and Adams Oshiomhole were through consensus. Even most of the congresses conducted so far this time around have been through the consensus option. For peace to reign, the CECPC is reaching out to other stakeholders, such as the governors and National Assembly caucus to get their buy-in to work out the modalities for the consensus option before the NEC meeting, where the format and schedule of activities for the forthcoming convention will be approved.\u201d\n\nThe stage is however set for the national convention, with all the aspirants engaging in strategic campaigns and consultations ahead of the date. As at the last count, no fewer than 10 party chieftains from the North are jostling to contest for the chairmanship seat. They are Senator Tanko Al-Makura, Senator Kashim Shettima, Senator George Akume, Mr. Sunny Moniedafe, Senator Mohammed Musa, Mallam Salihu Mustapha, former Minister of Aviation, Mallam Isa Yuguda, former governors of Zamfara and Borno states, Abdulaziz Yari and Ali Modu Sherrif respectively.\n\nAbdulaziz Yari:\n\nAbdulaziz Yari, a two-term former governor of Zamfara State, is one of the leading aspirants for the office. Yari believes he has what it takes to lead the party to victory come 2023. He is a one-time chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF); a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors.\n\nThe defection of the current Governor Bello Matawalle to the ruling APC is seen by political watchers as a threat to Yari\u2019s aspirations. Some of his supporters that Matawalle has lured to the party may whittle down Yari\u2019s influence and control of the party structure and machinery in the state. Eventually, this may ultimately frustrate his chairmanship ambition.\n\nA very strong-willed man, Yari is not known to give up on a mission he set out to accomplish. He has dismissed all alleged plots by some bigwigs from the Northwest against his aspiration. For him, nobody, except providence can succeed in undermining his his aspiration.\n\nYari said: \u201cIf God decides that it should be, it is going to be. People can manouvre and do all sorts of calculations, but they will not prevail. All I know is that I can lead this party and they know what I can do.\n\n\u201cSome persons can fabricate lies but at the end of the day, the truth will prevail. There are so many other things they have said that is a mere tissue of lies meant to try to get a good man down but they will never succeed.\u201d\n\nYari said despite his inability to accomplish all the objectives it set for itself in its progressive manifesto, the APC has abundant chances of winning the 2023 elections in a very remarkable way, if the \u201cright things\u201d are done between now and next year.\n\nAli Modu Sheriff:\n\nFormer Borno State Governor Ali Modu Sheriff is the most controversial figure in the race. A founding member of the APC, he is also a leader of the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP), one of the legacy parties that metamorphosed into the APC.\n\nIn 2014 Sheriff jumped ship to the then ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP). His political clout, the massive human capacity to mobilise and garner support for himself saw him becoming the national chairman of the PDP within a short period of defecting to the party before his NWC was sacked by the Supreme Court. By April 26, 2018, he returned back to the APC.\n\nAhead of the proposed APC national convention, the 65-year old politician has embarked on nationwide strategic consultations with the major blocs within the party. Only last week he was in Jigawa State to sell his national chairmanship aspiration to Governor Abubakar Badaru.\n\nA man of enormous financial muscle, political pundits continue to see the infamous role he played in the PDP as an albatross to his APC national chairmanship aspiration. Despite his considerable influence in Bornu State, he is not in the same political camp with Governor Babagana Zulum, whose body language is visibly in support of Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\nA leader of the Sheriff\u2019s mobilization team, Dr. Cairo Ojugbo said the party needs a man of the Sheriff\u2019s pedigree at this crucial period.\n\nIsa Yuguda:\n\nA smooth and silent political operator, the former Bauchi State governor and former Minister of Aviation, Isa Yuguda, is another gladiator seeking to take over the APC National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nA banker-turned politician, Yuguda, while hosting the leaders of Coalition of APC Support Groups, gave his mission statement and why he is the most qualified party man to lead the over 40 million strong APC.\n\nYuguda said he is in the race because he understands the power dynamics at the centre while he served as minister for six years and governor for eight years. He said he is not coming to warm the seat as national chairman but to proffer quality solutions to resolve the lingering crisis and division in the party.\n\nIf he emerges as the national chairman, Yuguda promised to ensure that justice and equity are entrenched in the party and that he would guarantee party supremacy, which he assured would help put an end to the various crisis rocking the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cI felt I was strongly favoured by the Almighty God who created us. I felt very strongly that rather than relegating myself to the bush where I am now, I feel I should come back and offer myself because I know I have been favoured.\u201d\n\nA strong believer in the country\u2019s democratic future, the former Minister of Aviation recently told reporters in Abuja that despite the \u2018terrible\u2019 nature of Nigerian politics, he was never afraid to return to the murky political waters to offer himself because he has been highly favoured by God.\n\nHe added: \u201cI was privileged to serve in Nigeria for six years as minister and eight as governor. I think I have served long enough in the Villa to know the dynamism in the power at the centre. If I am the dullest person, at least I still have to offer something that will be meaningful. This is why I said let me give it a shot. If I succeed, fine and good and if I don\u2019t the Almighty Allah will not say you did not come out.\u201d\n\nRead Also: PDP crisis: APC, two more governors begin defection talks\n\nFor the Chairman Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Coalition, Mr. Tunde Imolehin, who is a member of the APC national membership registration and revalidation committee for the Southwest, \u201cYuguda falls in the category of party leaders who can direct the affairs of the party; someone whom everybody would listen to any time he speaks due to his rich background and experience.\n\n\u201cI believe we are here to begin a journey we will never regret, a journey that will be sustainable. It is a journey that will answer all the intrigues and all the challenges; all the misunderstandings and all the misconceptions that have happened since 2015.\u201d\n\nKashim Shettima:\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima, another former Borno State governor, is a highly influential lawmaker in the National Assembly, whose administrative acumen, excellent human relations, and intellectual capability are the unique selling points that are likely to work in his favour in the chairmanship race.\n\nThough Shetima is yet to make public his intention, observers are of the view that major party stakeholders may prefer him for the chairmanship position. His supporters are quick to brandish his high sense of justice, especially in his choice of a worthy successor.\n\nDespite the fact that he has a penchant for speaking the truth to the throne, Shettima is said to be held in high esteem by President Buhari. In a presidential congratulatory message recently to the former governor, Buhari was quoted to have said: \u201cI am proud of Shettima for his achievements in office as one of the best governors in the country for the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges of insecurity, he was able to make his mark because he was able to keep his key campaign promises; he proved his mettle and did not disappoint the electorate. Senator Shettima will be remembered for many things, including the fact that he handed the state over to Prof Babagana Zulum, a capable and deserving successor.\u201d\n\nPushing for an NWC with Shetima at the helms of the affair, Adamu Modibo, an APC chieftain from Yobe State eulogised the leadership qualities of the chairmanship hopeful and maintained that the party stands to gain enormously from his administrative acumen and depth. Modibo added: \u201cAn NWC with Shettima as chairman is all we need to take the party to a higher level. This is a man of great influence across many interest groups, a bridge-builder, who sees possibilities in all situations and circumstances. This explains his success stories in Bornu State as a governor for eight years and now as a senator.\u201d\n\nTanko Al-Makura:\n\nTanko Al\u2013Makura is another high contender for the national chairmanship position. The 69-year-old businessman-turned politician was the former Nasarawa State governor. He is of the CPC legacy bloc; the only bloc that is yet to have a shot at the national chairmanship seat since the establishment of the party. Promoters of Al-Makura\u2019s candidacy also believe that he may enjoy presidential backing owing to his CPC roots.\n\nLike Shettima, the former Borno State Governor, Al-Makura also enjoys the support of his successor, Governor Abdullahi Sule. He also enjoys the support of some members of Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), being one of its earliest members and the Senate caucus.\n\nUntil his recent encounter with the anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Al-Makura is seen as a top contender and less controversial figure in the race for the APC chairmanship.\n\nDanjuma Goje:\n\nSenator Danjuma Goje, a former Gombe State governor, is another member of the league of former governors seeking to lead the party in post-Buhari era. Goje was elected as governor on the platform of the PDP. His political influence in the state was instrumental to APC takeover of the state in 2019.\n\nCurrently, a third-term senator representing Gombe Central and Chairman Senate Committee on Appropriation, Goje is a committed party man whose loyalty to party supremacy saw him dropping his ambition to run for the 9th Senate Presidency. He stepped down for current Senate President Ahmed Lawan.\n\nA highly-respected politician with national clout and appeal, Goje\u2019s campaign handlers promised his leadership will deliver a party where its (party) constitution, hierarchy, and supremacy would be respected.\n\nBut, political observers in the Northeast have expressed fear that the cold war between the lawmaker and Governor Inuwa Yahaya over control of party structure in the state may affect his ambition. They argue that the influential role of the Progressive Governors Forum in determining who gets what in the party may be deployed by Yahaya to stall Goje\u2019s aspiration.\n\nSunny Moniedafe:\n\nSunny Moniedafe was the first to declare his intention to succeed Oshiomhole. As early as the beginning of the year, the former Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) has openly expressed interest in running for the office.\n\nBorn and raised in Adamawa State by parents from Delta State, Moniedafe has described himself as the best man for the job. He explained that his candidature will unify the party because he neither plays ethnic nor religious politics.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Adamu opposes zoning of presidential ticket in APC\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m vying for the office of the national chairman of the APC because I want to give the party a new sense of direction. I have no godfather and I am no pushover. I will contest if it is zoned to the Northeast. If it is not zoned to us, I will contest any position zoned to us because I want to serve.\u201d\n\nHe may have not occupied any elective office, but he believes his administrative experience in party management even before APC was established gives him an edge.\n\nHe told reporters recently: \u201cIf given the opportunity to serve as national chairman of the APC, my team will, first of all, re-affirm the respect for and supremacy of the party\u2019s constitution, and ensuring its effective implementation, whilst maintaining utmost discipline.\n\n\u201cI will put every bit of my energy to institute an effective working synergy among all party structures and arms of the government, which is critical to ensuring that promises made during campaigns are not mere rhetoric but will be accelerated and fulfilled to the letter for the good of Nigeria and its citizens, as well as excellent global relations.\n\n\u201cMy dealings as a national chairman will exhibit absolute transparency in the party\u2019s affairs as one of its hallmarks. We will be free of any form of influence or corruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi Adamu:\n\nThe former Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Adamu remains the man to beat at the forthcoming national convention for the post of national chairman.\n\nAdamu is a third term senator and veteran politician who entered the political scene in 1977 as an elected member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the constitution of the short-lived Second Republic. He was the first secretary-general of the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in Plateau State. Later, he became its state chairman in 1982.\n\nCurrently the chairman of the newly reconstituted APC National Reconciliation Committee, Adamu may leverage on his new appointment to push further his aspiration as he reaches out to all aggrieved members.\n\nAdamu intends to bring his wealth of experience to bear as a one-time chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF). But, his detractors accuse him of being too pro-North. Though he commands a lot of respect at home, he may not likely to get the support of his home state.\n\nSaliu Mustapha:\n\nHis name may not ring a bell because he is not been in the elite club of former governors, but he is well known within the political circle. The young-businessman-turned politician is as good as any of the aspirants. He represents new hope in the political landscape of the country.\n\nAn astute grassroots politician from Kwara State, Mustapha has paid his dues in political party administration. A founding member of the APC, he was the national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC. In his entire sojourn in the political terrain over two decades ago, he has held various administrative positions.\n\nHe is also the second most senior member of the defunct CPC. Indeed, Mustapha may cash on this to clinch the party\u2019s highest office, more also when the CPC bloc is angling to produce the next national chairman. Both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nMustapha has promised to be the bridge between the old and the young generations in the party. He has also promised to abide by the Rule of Law and party supremacy, as well as adhere strictly to the letters and spirit of the party constitution and build on the gains so far made by the Mala Buni-led national caretaker committee.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa:\n\nUnarguably the youngest of all the chairmanship aspirants, the 54-year old member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly represents Niger East Senatorial district. Fondly called \u201cSani 313\u201d by his political admirers, the chairmanship hopeful represents the new political yearnings.\n\nBack in Niger State where he hails from, Sani caught his political teeth from his late father, Alhaji Tanko Bawa Musa, the Iyan Minna, who was the chairman of Piakoro Local Government Area, and from his elder brother, Abdullahi Musa, a former member of the House of Representatives between 1999 and 2003.\n\nIn 2007, the young Sani launched himself into the murky waters of Nigerian politics. He contested for the PDP governorship ticket and lost. This forced him to return to his private business. But, by 2019 luck shined on him, as he was elected to the Senate to represent Niger East.\n\nA man of proven integrity, Sani who recently declared his intention to become the next national chairman said: \u201cMy experience in private and public sectors, the capacity required to manage diverse people and interests irrespective of tribe, religion and region is already imbibed by me. I am a mobilizer, a bridge-builder, and a strategist that is passionate about the wholesome development of the nation. I possess a strong interpersonal skill by demonstrating the utmost discretion and integrity in all of my dealings.\u201d\n\nSani Musa\u2019s political credentials may not be intimidating, what he lacks in party politics, he has in abundance in human management. A focused and humane person, his victory at the convention will bring a new lease to the party.\n\nMusa is believed to have the endorsement of his governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, who may use his influence as a member of the national caretaker committee of the party to swing support for Sani 313.\n\nGeorge Akume:\n\nA two-term governor of Benue State, Senator George Akume is the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs. He is perceived as the most eligible aspirant to occupy the position of APC national chairman.\n\nThe former Minority Leader of the Senate from June 2011 to June 2015, Akume who recently opened a campaign office for the actualization of his dream, is poised to be the next national chairman of the party.\n\nOne of his supporters, Scheme Adams said: \u201cArrangements have been concluded for our candidate to formally declare his intention in Makrudi, the Benue State capital. Our leader has all it takes to lead the party. Having successfully governed a state for eight years, he was a senator, where he was elected as Minority Leader because of the traits his colleagues saw in him and now a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This is the type of leader we need to bring his experience to bear in piloting the affairs of the party.\u201d\n\nThe coast is clear, the party looks set for the national convention and the job schedule for the incoming NWC is designed. What is important is the emergence of a national chairman that will be able to manage the fallout of the congresses conducted, effectively prepare and fashion a strategy that will ensure victory for the party in 2023.\n\nIn the words of a chieftain of the party, Abdullahi Jalo: \u201cThe kind of national chairman we need now is one who can unite the party, he must have grassroots appeal and command the respect of all members.\u201d",
          "summary": "The two major national conventions that produced the former National Working Committees (NWC) did not generate the kind of attention the forthcoming national convention is currently generating.\nSome elements in the defunct Congress for Positive Change (CPC) have mounted a campaign for the bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\u201cMy dealings as a national chairman will exhibit absolute transparency in the party\u2019s affairs as one of its hallmarks.\nBoth ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\nHe is perceived as the most eligible aspirant to occupy the position of APC national chairman.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja, Chinelo Obogo, Omoniyi Salaudeen, Lukman Olabiyi and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe battle for control of the reins of power assumed a new twist yesterday, as political leaders drawn from the northern and southern parts announced a new coalition, \u2018Rescue Nigeria Project\u2019 (RNP), with a mission to recruit a competent leader for the country in 2023.\n\nThose who attended the meeting at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, included former national secretary of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Ambassador Usman Bugaje, former minister of education, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, former Kwara governor, Abdul Fatah Ahmed and Prof. Pat Utomi. Conspicuously absent were former deputy governor of Kogi State, Yomi Awoniyi and former Cross Rivers State governor, Donald Duke.\n\nIn his welcome address, Bugaje identified poor leadership recruitment process at the heart of the problems confronting the country. He said the RNP was determined to push for new standards with competence, discipline and character to make a difference.\n\n\u201cThe Rescue Nigeria Project is founded on the premise that the problems of this country, many and varied as they are, all emanate from poor leadership. In other words when you reduce the problems of this country to what they are, ultimately, it all comes to leadership.\n\n\u201cWe have been unable to exit the leadership conundrum precisely because the leadership recruitment mechanism in our political parties is so flawed that, except for accidents, they are incapable of producing competent leaders with the requisite knowledge, discipline and commitment to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe are living with or better still, groaning under the consequences of this folly. What this means is that any attempt to rescue this country from its troubles must first rescue it from the current leadership recruitment mechanism that seems to leverage on money and connection or ethnic sentiments and no premium on knowledge or competence.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is how to introduce a set of criteria or better still re-calibrate the recruitment mechanism in our political parties to prioritize knowledge, competence and character. The deepening crises in the political parties is all the more reason why this re-calibration is necessary.\n\n\u201cOur core values, rightly start with ethical leadership which speaks to the character of leaders, the key features of competence, capacity and the courage to do the right thing, motivated by patriotism, selflessness and service, conscious of inclusiveness, fairness, equity, mutual respect and accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe intend to renew the spirit of leadership and create new standards to speak to the role this great country is expected to play in the great continent of Africa..\n\nOn calls for zoning of elective offices, particularly the presidency, Bugaje said priority should be given to competence.\n\n\u201cWe must seek to change the conversation about leadership. The first thing we should want to know about our president is not which part of country he or she comes from, rather how competent is he or she? What is the content of his policy document? What is his team made up of, etc. We also seek to ensure a seismic shift from the politics of big men to the politics of big ideas. The empty politics of big men has not taken us anywhere but down the drain. We simply can\u2019t continue this way.\n\n\u201cWe also have to prioritise Knowledge, because as we all know, in the 21st century, knowledge is the greatest capital. That is the only thing that give countries the competitive edge. Governance must be driven by ideas, it has to be creative and must create solutions, especially job creation, economic growth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nFormer Kwara governor, Ahmed, said performance of the present administration in the last six years fell short of expectations of most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, Nigerians embraced change. Today, that change appears to be what we didn\u2019t expect. There is insecurity. There is widespread poverty and incompetence in government. Today, we have high level of nepotism and lack of exclusiveness. These have given rise to agitations by different ethnic groups.\u201d\n\nProfessor Adeniran alerted the nation to what he described as the growing loss of direction and hopelessness amongst Nigerian youths.\n\nMeanwhile, Elder-statesman and frontline Yoruba leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and the Aare Onakankanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, have tackled the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) on its plot to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nDirector of Publicity and Advocacy of the group, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, had insisted that North has the votes and would not play second fiddle to any other part of Nigeria.\n\nThe Arewa group said it had no apologies for rejecting the demands of the Southern Governors Forum that the 2023 presidency be zoned to the South.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV Morning Show, Ahmed, who was responding to the backlash by prominent southerners and groups said no one has the constitutional right to compel any part of the country on how to vote and that if northerners chose to elect a northern president in a free and fair election, people should have to live with it.\n\n\u201cThe approach of the southern governors and some organised groups in the south in speaking from both sides of the mouth is wrong. Even as we speak, certain southern governors who are saying we must do this or that are secretly negotiating and jostling for positions for themselves for 2023. They know all the options that are available and are actively involved in this. They know the politicians from the northern part of the country including their colleagues but they come out and create a bipartisan fallacy and start making demands that they know are inconsistent with the democratic process. This should stop because it is not helping. What we are saying is to allow a democratic process to determine who will become our president and we should ensure that we pick someone better than President Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to Chief Edwin Clark who faulted the claim that the population of the north is an advantage, Hakeem said: \u201cFor people like Chief Adebanjo and sometimes, Chief Clark to say things like, \u2018if you don\u2019t do this, there would be no elections in 2023\u2019, (they) have no control over what happens in 2023. These kind of statements are what cause tension in the country.\n\n\u201cWith due respect, there are many elderly people like Chief Clark and Chief Adebanjo who speak in a language which elders should not be speaking. They have no business leading groups. These are people who create more problems for politicians and politicians become hostages of rhetorics that people have.\u201d\n\nHowever, Adebanjo, in his reaction said: \u201cI agree with him that we are not patriots because we don\u2019t agree to the subjugation of the South to the Fulani in the North. If that is why we are not patriots, we agree. On the issue of power shift, what he said about retaining power in the North is part of the arrogance of their leaders, who want Nigeria to remain one, but on the condition that they have the rulers. It will not work. We had discussed that with his forefathers; so, we are not going to argue that with him again. If that is why we are not patriots, we are not going to agree on that. We knew we wouldn\u2019t need their agreement before we said that we are not going to have presidency in the North in 2023. That is why we are insisting on changing of the constitution, which they gave to us through the military in 1966. And until that one is done, there can be no peace in this country. We are not going to stay in Nigeria where they will be the rider and we will be the horse. I don\u2019t want to go into any argument with him. When did he come into existence? We\u2019ve had these arguments with his forefathers. We don\u2019t need to argue that again.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Adams said other regions of the country were fully aware of the antic of the North to continue to dominate them and were ready to turn the table around.\n\nThe Yoruba generalissimo who spoke at Ibeju, Lagos during the maiden edition of Egbe Festival organized by the Olokun Festival Foundation (OFF), lambasted said NEF\u2019s statement only exposed the domineering agenda of the north and was capable of setting the nation on fire.\n\nHe held that Nigeria was not property of any region and any attempt by the North to force it domineering agenda on others would be resisted.\n\nThis is Igbo youths under the aegis of the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, (COSEYL) warned that the South East would produce its own president if that happens.\n\nAhmed, while speaking at the maiden Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series organized by the students wing of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, said anyone who did not want a northerner as president in 2023 can leave the country.\n\nHowever, in a statement by it president general, Goodluck Ibem, the group described the utterance by the northern statesman as unfortunate and disapointing.\n\n\u201cIt was the support of the south that made President Buhari to win his elections in 2015 and 2019. We are very surprised that Hakeem has suddenly forgotten so soon how President Buhari emerged as president. History doesn\u2019t lie, he should go back to history to refresh his memory. We, as the youth leaders of South East geopolitical zone, stand by the decision of the southern governors that the office of the Nigerian president be zoned to the South for equity and justice. Enough said,\u201d Ibem stated.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has described his nomination for The Sun Man of the Year 2020 Award as a loud call to double his efforts in delivering on his mandate .\n\nSpeaking when he received The Sun delegation led by the Managing Director/Editor-In-Chief, Mr Onuoha Ukeh, who visited to present to him a letter notifying him of his nomination as The Sun Man of the Year 2020, in Abuja, Kyari said he was humbled by the recognition.\n\nHe stressed that singling him out forcthe award in the midst of millions of illustrious Nigerians would propel him to surpass his current feat.\n\nThe NNPC boss said: \u201cI wonder if I do deserve this award because I\u2019m just doing what I have to do as NNPC GMD. I\u2019m working according to my conscience and the need to make this place a better place. That is the least I can do. Doing something that makes you happy without regret and being honoured for it gives a good feeling. This appreciation comes from the depths of my heart.\n\n\u201cTo be singled out among many excellent Nigerians is also good, but this is a huge challenge. I can\u2019t query your choice of me. Irrespective of my thoughts, it\u2019s a challenge to do more to show I merit the honour and add one more step everyday. It\u2019s a call to more duty, to make Nigeria a better place because there are people watching what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe elated NNPC GMD said he was looking forward to receiving the award on October 16, while giving assurance of working in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nNoting that \u201c no country develops without being inclusive,\u201d Kyari said being inclusive, in his context, does not mean the usual ethnic narrative but a strategic cause aimed at achieving national cohesion.\n\n\u201cThere is hunger everywhere and challenges everywhere. So, inclusion is key here so it can benefit everyone and you would see all these issues of secession die down,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, The Sun MD told Kyari that his name was selected by the newspaper\u2019s board of editors, after a rigorous procedure that considered many factors bordering mainly on achievements and character.\n\nListing why the NNPC GMD was chosen, he said: \u201cWe note that following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, you, realising the condition of the country\u2019s existing healthcare system, rallied operators in all oil and gas sectors to raise over N21 billion to support the fight against the spread of the disease.\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, 26 per cent of the fund raised to support the fight against COVID-19 was deployed for the provision of logistics and in-patient support equipment such as ambulances, ventilators, isolation centres, etc, with every state of the federation benefitting from the donations.\u201d\n\nHe said at the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NNPC continued to deliver on its mandate by signing the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract of the NLNG Train-7 project with the SCD JV Consortium comprising affiliates of Saipem, Chiyoda and Daewoo.\n\n\u201cLast year, NNPC recorded major strides in the gas sector with the commissioning of the Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility (IGHF) and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and Dispensing Unit, constructed to address domestic gas supply challenges. The facilities currently deliver over 200 million standard cubic feet of dry gas per day and 330 metric tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) which is equivalent to 16 units of 20 tonnes LPG trucks per day into the domestic market.\n\n\u201cAs NNPC GMD, you have ensured the publication of the Audited Financial Statements of the Corporation and its 19 subsidiaries registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 1990, as amended alongside that of the National Petroleum Investment and Management Services (NAPIMS) to provide clarity on Joint Venture finances. This is the first time the Corporation\u2019s Audited Financial Statements were ever made public.\u201d\n\nThe Sun MD noted that Kyari had led NNPC to achieve a $300 million reduction in the cost of the AKK Gas Pipeline contract via contract renegotiation from the initial $2.8billion.\n\nHe further stated that the NNPC executed a Joint Venture agreement with NIPCO to help in the marketing and distribution of the product, with the aim of getting as many Nigerians as possible to migrate to the use of gas as automotive fuel.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Awards ceremony will be held at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday, October 16.\n\nApart from Kyari, others who will receive awards are: Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State (Man of the Year); Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State ( Governor of the Year); Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (Political Icon); and Comrade Philip Shaibu, Deputy Governor of Edo State (Sports Personality).\n\nOthers are Allen Onyema, chairman, Air Peace and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke (Exceptional Philanthropist); Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), chairman, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency and Brig Gen Ibrahim Shuaibu, Director General of the National Youths Service Corps (Public Service); Engr Nnamdi Ezigbo, chairman, SLOT Systems Limited and Dr. ABC Ojiakor, chairman, SEPLAT Petroleum Company Ltd (Entrepreneur of the Year); Alhaji Mustapha Ado, chairman, Ammasco International Ltd and Chief Ebuka Onunkwo, Chairman, Seahorse Lubricant Industries Limited (Industrialist of the Year).\n\nAlso to be honoured are First Lady of Ondo State, Chief Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu (Most Supportive First Lady,); Chief Obinna Iyiegbu (Obi Cubana), chairman of Cubana Group (Hospitality Icon) and Kanayo O. Kanaya, star actor and producer (Nollywood Icon).\n\nOther award winners are Mr. Moses Ekpo, deputy governor of Akwa Ibom State, Chief Olabode George, Prof George Obiozor, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and Amb. Babagana Kingibe (Lifetime Achievement); Chief Frank Okafor, chairman of Marco Polo Group Limited and Prince Chris Igwe, chairman, Mainland Oil Limited (Investor of the Year).\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari, to amend the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 passed by the National Assembly over two months ago.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter dated September 16, 2021, and read during plenary on Tuesday by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari in the letter explained that the appointment of two non-executive members as provided for by the Act to the board of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) and Upstream Regulatory Commission (URC) did not reflect balanced geopolitical representation.\n\nHe, therefore, requested amendment to Sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b) which provides for the Administrative Structure of the PIA 2021, to increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six on the boards of the NPRA and URC.\n\nAccording to him, doing so would foster national unity and \u201cprovide a sense of participation and inclusion to almost every section of the country in the decision making of strategic institutions such as the oil industry\u201d.\n\nIn addition, the president proposed a deletion of Sections 11(2)(f), 11(2)(g), 34(2)(f) and 34(2)(g) from the Petroleum Industry Act, which would see to the removal of the Ministries of Petroleum and Finance form the Board of the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Authority and Upstream Regulatory Commission.\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe proposed amendment will increase the membership of the board from nine (9) to thirteen (13) members that is representing 44 percent expansion of the board size.\n\n\u201cThis composition would strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or inter-governmental relations. They can continue to perform such roles without being in the board.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to not that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be Directors \u2013 being same rank with Directors in the institution. This may bring some complications in some decision making especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nHe also sought an amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) to be replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the Board of the Commission or Authority under section 2 shall be made by the President, while those made pursuant to subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of section shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\nThe President further requested that Section 41(2) of the Petroleum Industry Act be replaced with a new section as \u201cthere shall be five (5) executive directors for the Authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the Federal Civil Service with each responsible for one of the following.\u201d\n\nThe president, in his proposed the amendment, underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for employees of the Authority.\n\n\u201cIn future, these positions will obviously be filled by the workers in the Authority through career progression in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Civil Service,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "FG probes fraud in COVID-19 vaccination",
          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nFederal Government said it had uncovered fraud in the administration of COVID-19 vaccines that had to do with people trying to get vaccination cards without being vaccinated.\n\nIn response, it said the State Security Services (SSS), ICPC and other law enforcement agencies have been engaged to investigate and prosecute persons and their accomplices attempting to fraudulently acquire vaccination cards.\n\nSpecifically, government said it recently arrested and was prosecuting a staff of the FCT State Primary Healthcare Development Board, who was involved in the criminal act.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, told journalists at a press conference in Abuja, that the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) was unhappy with the fraudulent attempts and has urged those attempting such acts to desist henceforth.\n\nHe insisted that ongoing COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination cards were free of charge at all designated sites across the 36 states and the FCT. He insisted that possession of vaccination cards without receiving the vaccines is criminal and punishable by law.\n\nHe encouraged Nigerians to immediately report any suspected cases of buying and selling of COVID-19 vaccination cards without receiving the vaccines to the nearest law enforcement agency or to NPHCDA.\n\nHe reiterated that the agency was closely working with NAFDAC to monitor and handle any Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI).\n\n\u201cIn this second phase of the vaccination rollout, we\u2019ve had 4,349 reports of non-serious AEFI cases and 40 reports of serious AEFI cases with the Moderna vaccines. For AstraZeneca, we have had 1,115 non-serious AEFI cases and 38 serious AEFI cases, and these cases have been successfully treated and the affected persons are doing well and going about their normal duties.\u201d\n\nDr. Faisal informed journalists that Nigeria has got the International Coordinating Group (ICG) approval for 3,566,628 doses of the oral Cholera vaccines, and based on the shortage of the vaccine globally, they were able to secure some doses and had strategically mapped out and identified areas for deployment in the three states with the highest number of cases as a reactive campaign.\n\n\u201cObviously, we are not relenting in the fight against cholera outbreak working side by side with the NCDC. We would continue to apply for more doses of the cholera vaccine, and we believe that as these vaccines become readily available, Nigeria would get more doses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the NPHCDA boss allayed fears of negative effect of the recent decision of the UK government to ban nationals of some countries from entering UK, assuring Nigerians that the new travel advisory would not be binding on them.\n\n\u201cAs you may be aware, the UK government released a new travel advisory which would take effect from Monday October 4, 2021. And there have been concerns by Nigerians on how the new decision would affect them. We would like to clarify that the guidance provided by the UK government was that they would want to simplify the classification of countries from green, amber and red to just red and green list. Therefore, countries that are currently on the amber list may fall into either of these two categories.\n\n\u201cWe have had preliminary discussions with officials of the UK government. Without prejudice to the information yet to be released, we have been assured that Nigeria will maintain the status quo. That is to say Nigeria will not be on the red list.\n\n\u201cThe UK government have also stated that they have no issues with the vaccines being administered in Nigeria. For instance, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, also known as COVISHIELD that is used in Nigeria was approved by the UK regulatory body (MHRA), other stringent regulatory authorities and the World Health Organization. So, the UK Government does recognize the vaccines used in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe UK is, perhaps, doing a phased approach to deal with the high demand and volume of people arriving their Country. It is important to stress that this phased approach is still under review by their Government and they would be providing updates regularly.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria at the moment, there is no change in the guidelines for entry of Nigerians into the UK. A UK citizen on entry into Nigeria regardless of the vaccination status, is made to do a PCR test and isolate for seven days. Same applies for Nigerians entering the UK. This is called the principle of reciprocity in the diplomatic circles.\n\n\u201cFrom our usual updates to the press and Nigerians, Citizens are aware that the vaccines used in Nigeria are donations from the UK Government, the Canadian Government and the United States through the COVAX facility.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Buhari Proposes New Amendments to PIA, Nominates Regulatory Boards",
          "text": "*Seeks expansion of upstream, midstream memberships\n\n*Appoints Komolafe CEO of URC, retains DPR\u2019s Auwalu\n\n*Removes petroleum, finance ministries from agencies\u2019 boards\n\n*Sends EFCC board nominees for approval\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nExactly 37 days after the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was enacted, President Muhammadu Buhari has written to the senate, requesting amendments to the law and expansion of membership of the board of the Upstream Regulatory Commission (URC).\n\nBuhari, in a letter read yesterday on the floor of the senate, also sought an increase in the membership of the board of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe president hinged his desire to alter the new law on the need to ensure national balance in appointments into the boards, in the letter dated September 16, 2021, and read yesterday during plenary by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari further moved to fast-track the full operation of the newly signed Act, sending a list of nominees for the proposed URC, the regulator of the upstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry as well NMDPRA, which would oversee the midstream and downstream sector.\n\nBuhari explained that the appointment of two non-executive members to the board of the midstream, downstream and upstream commissions, as provided for by the Act, did not reflect balanced geopolitical representation.\n\nThe latest requests came about 48 hours after the president, in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources, triggered Section 53(1) of the PIA, directing the incorporation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited and approving the formation of a new board, which would be headed by Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\n\nBuhari requested amendment to Sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b), which provide for the administrative structure of the PIA 2021, to increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six on the upstream as well as midstream and downstream boards. He noted that doing so would foster national unity and provide a sense of participation and inclusion to almost every section of the country in the decision-making of strategic institutions, such as the oil industry.\n\nIn addition, the president proposed the deletion of sections 11(2)(f), 11(2)(g), 34(2)(f) and 34(2)(g) from the Act, which would see the removal of the ministries of petroleum resources and finance from both boards.\n\nBuhari wrote in the letter to the upper chamber, \u201cThe proposed amendments will increase the membership of the board from nine to 13 members, that is, representing 44 per cent expansion of the board size. This composition would strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\u201d\n\nOn the removal of the two ministries from the boards of the agencies, the president explained that they already had clear-cut roles and could carry out those responsibilities without necessarily being on the boards.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or inter-governmental relations,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThey can continue to perform such roles without being on the board.\u201d he added, maintaining, \u201cIt is also important to note that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be directors \u2013 being same rank with directors in the institutions. This may bring some complications in some decision making, especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nBuhari also sought amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) of the PIA, which would see them being replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the board of the commission or authority under Section 2 shall be made by the president, while those made pursuant to Subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of the section shall be subject to confirmation by the senate.\n\nBuhari further requested that Section 41(2) of the PIA be replaced with a new section to read, \u201cThere shall be five executive directors for the authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the federal civil service.\u201d\n\nIn his proposed amendments, the president underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments, arguing that this will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for their employees.\n\n\u201cIn future, these positions will obviously be filled by the workers in the authority through career progression in conformity with the rules and regulations of the federal civil service,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn the letters to the senate, the president said he was acting in accordance with the provisions of the different laws governing the establishments.\n\nFor the upstream, the president nominated Isa Ibrahim Modibbo as Chairman, while Mr. Gbenga Komolafe was selected as Chief Executive Officer. Hassan Gambo was chosen as Executive Commissioner, Finance and Accounts, while Ms. Rose Ndong was nominated Executive Commissioner, Exploration and Acreage Management.\n\nThe president retained Mr. Sarki Auwalu, who currently heads the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), as Chief Executive Officer of the proposed midstream and downstream authority. He listed Chairman of the authority as Idaere Gogo Ogan; Abiodun Adeniji as Executive Director, Finance and Accounts; and Ogbugo Ukoha as Executive Director, Distributions Systems, Storage and Retail Infrastructure.\n\nBuhari also sent to the upper chamber for screening and possible approval a list of nominees for the board of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe nominees for the EFCC board are George Ekpungu, Secretary to the Commission (Cross River); Lukman Muhammed (Edo); Anumba Adaeze (Enugu); Alhaji Kola Adesina (Kwara); and Alhaji Yahaya Muhammad (Yobe).\n\nBuhari urged the senate to consider and confirm the nominees in an expeditious manner, given the important role they will play in the current administration.\n\nA profile of the CEO of the upstream commission, Komolafe, obtained by THISDAY showed that he had been deeply involved in strategic policy formulation and implementation in the oil and gas industry for about 27 years.\n\nKomolafe is an expert in institutional process study and designs for curbing revenue leakages and attaining optimum national productivity. He has initiated and coordinated various policies that generated and saved the country billions of dollars in his various capacities and national assignments.\n\nThe 57-year-old engineer from Ondo State was Managing Director, Nigeria Pipeline and Storage Company (NPSC), where he initiated the reform and business model for maintenance and operations of NNPC pipelines and depot infrastructure efficiently on private Joint Venture (JV) basis. This saved Nigeria monies that had perennially been expended on national downstream petroleum assets maintenance, operations and security.\n\nIn addition, he was Group General Manager, Special Duties at the NNPC; Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division; and Executive Director (Commercial) Pipelines and Petroleum Marketing Company (PPMC). He was also General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF); and General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), among several other positions.\n\nAside being an engineer, Komolafe has degrees in law, as well as industrial and labour relations, and a recipient of various awards.\n\nBoth chambers of the National Assembly had before embarking on their annual vacation in July passed the harmonised version of the long awaited legislation, before transmitting it to the president for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*House alleges fleeing bandits from Katsina, Zamfara attacking Kano\n\n*Emir condemns dialoguing with criminals\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Olawale Ajimotokan in Katsina and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has warned the federal government that banditry has transformed into insurgency and that the hoodlums, who orchestrated the carnage had started to relocate from the regions to other parts of the country, hence, the need for drastic action to eliminate them.\n\nHe advised the federal government to adopt new security measures that would completely liquidate insurgents and bandits terrorising the country, particularly, the North West and North East zones, where his state falls.\n\nMasari, who spoke when he received the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed at the Government House, Katsina, added that bandits are relocating to the fringes of the forest to unleash terror on innocent citizens.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom experiences of other countries, you need to liquidate banditry and insurgency completely. I said it before let me repeat it again, the issue of banditry in Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, part of Niger and Kaduna States has no religious problem and tribal.\n\n\u201cSo, if you take whatever action nobody will complain to you on religious or tribal grounds. We are the same people same language, same culture and tradition. We have certainly became enemies of each other; the good ones on this part and the bad ones on the other part\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn everything there is collateral damage, even if you want to clean your room completely in the process you will lose something that you like. So, in dealing with these people of the forest there may be some collateral damages but we need to take action\u201d.\n\nHe, however, said North-west governors have reviewed the issues surrounding the failure of many efforts in order to curb banditry, lamenting that there are 150 bandits\u2019 camps in adjoining forests of Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna and Niger States operating independently.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cToday, in these forests of Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna going down to Niger, there are over 150 different camps of bandits each one operating independently\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Minister, Mohammed said the security measures adopted by the Masari-led government in combating banditry were yielding positive results.\n\nHe added that the efforts need to be trumpet in order to encourage security agencies and other stakeholders in the ongoing war against banditry and terrorism to do more in warding off the carnage.\n\nThe minister stated this in Katsina while in audience with Governor Masari and other top government officials to ascertain the security measures put in place by the governor in curbing insecurity.\n\nSharing this viewpoint, the House of Representatives, has also raised the alarm that bandits fleeing from military operations in Zamfara and Katsina States, had infiltrated and attacking other states in the zones, including Kano State.\n\nThis is as the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, has condemned those calling for dialogue with bandits, declaring that the criminals do not deserve human rights.\n\nHowever, Masari, who spoke when receiving the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, at the Government House, Katsina, reiterated that bandits were relocating to the fringes of the forest to unleash terror on innocent citizens.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFrom experiences of other countries, you need to liquidate banditry and insurgency completely. I said it before, let me repeat it again, the issue of banditry in Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, part of Niger and Kaduna States, has no religious problem and tribal.\n\n\u201cSo, if you take whatever action, nobody will complaint to you on religious or tribal grounds.\n\nWe are the same people, same language, same culture and tradition. We have certainly become enemies of each other; the good ones on this part and the bad ones on the other part.\n\n\u201cIn everything, there is collateral damage, even if you want to clean your room completely in the process, you will lose something that you like. So, in dealing with the people of the forest, there may be some collateral damages, but we need to take action\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the North West governors had reviewed the issues surrounding the failure of many efforts in order to curb banditry, lamenting that there were 150 bandit camps in adjoining forests of Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna and Niger States, operating independently.\n\nThe governor maintained that, \u201ctoday, in these forests of Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna right up to Niger, there are over 150 different camps of bandits, each one operating independently\u201d.\n\nMohammed, who spoke earlier, said the security measures adopted by the Masari-led government in combating banditry were yielding positive results.\n\nHe added that the efforts needed to be ramped up and security agencies and other stakeholders encouraged and appreciated in the ongoing war against banditry and terrorism, to do more in warding off the carnage.\n\n\u201cWe are not in any doubt that some of the measures you (Masari) embarked upon have started yielding fruits. However, it is unfortunate that the media is not giving same attention to the tune of events as it\u2019s being given to the activities of the bandits. We believe that these efforts desired to be trumpeted.\u201d\n\nAlso, on Tuesday, the House raised the alarm at plenary following the adoption of a motion by Hon. Haruna Dederi, on the need to take urgent measures to check frequent attacks by bandits on Rogo Local Government Area of Kano.\n\nThe lawmaker said Rogo and Karaye Local Government Areas shared borders with Katsina and Kaduna States, which for sometime have been bedeviled by the nefarious activities of armed bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the military operation against bandits in Zamfara and Katsina States, the bandits are now fleeing into other states, including Kano State,\u201d Dederi said.\n\nHe lamented that in the last few weeks, bandits had attacked towns and villages in Rogo, including Jajaye, Zarewa, RuwanBago, Bari, Falgore, Dutsen-Bari and Hawan \u2014Gwamna (Fulatan), where they kidnapped people, who were still mostly in their captivity and demanding several millions for their release.\n\nDederi, therefore, expressed worry that if measures were not immediately taken to stop the activities of bandits in Rogo Local Government Area and other border councils of Kano State, their nefarious activities could spread to other local places, thereby upsetting the relative peace being enjoyed in the state.\n\nConsequently, the House urged the federal government to set up a well equipped Joint Security Taskforce with the mandate to operate along the border lines between Katsina, Kaduna and Kano States, to address the frequent attacks by armed bandits in Rogo and other affected border councils.\n\nThe House also resolved that a similar joint security taskforce be set up by the government in Abia and Kogi to arrest the security situations in both states, while at the same time, urged the federal government to step up efforts to consolidate the gains recorded in the military operation against armed banditry by expanding the operation in a coordinated and simultaneous manner that would cover all other affected states and prevent the movement of the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Katsina, while speaking during an interactive media session on insecurity co-organised by the Katsina State government and the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, kicked against the payment of ransom to bandits and accused those who carry out the unwholesome act of hiding behind human rights to commit crime.\n\n\u201cSome of the bandits have settled in our cities. They have started buying lands and are now building houses in our communities. Bandits can never repent. Though we are in a democracy, but bandits don\u2019t deserve to enjoy human rights that they are denying others,\u201d the Emir said.\n\nHe lauded Masari\u2019s decision to shut down telecommunication service in the state, ban the sale of petrol in jerry cans along border communities, close animal markets, ban the sale of fairly used motorcycles and close junction motor parks, saying the decision had improved security in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\n\n\nNigeria has raised $4 billion through Eurobonds, which was a reflection of investors\u2019 confidence in the economy.\n\nThe amount was raised after an intensive two days of virtual meetings with investors across the globe.\n\nIn a statement issued last night, the Debt Management Office (DMO) explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis exceptional performance has been described as, \u201cone of the biggest financial trades to come out of Africa in 2021\u201d and \u201can excellent outcome\u201d.\n\nAccording to the DMO, bids for the Eurobonds were received from investors in Europe and America, as well as Asia. There was also good participation by local investors.\n\nAccording to the statement, the size of the Order Book and the quality of investors demonstrates confidence in Nigeria.\n\nThe Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years\u2013,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum\n\nThe long tenors of the Eurobonds and the spread across different maturities are well aligned with Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, 2020 \u20132023, the DMO said.\n\nIt stressed that since the Eurobonds were issued as part of the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the raising of $4 billion through Eurobonds\n\nprovides a significant amount of funds to finance projects in the Act, thus contributing to the implementation of the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nNigeria returned to the International Capital Market (ICM) three years after its last outing in 2018, when it floated a $2.5 billion aggregate Eurobonds under its Global Medium Term Note Programme.\n\nThe DMO had stated that in addition to providing funding to part-finance the deficit in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the issuance of the Eurobonds would benefits the country in many other strategic ways.\n\nAccording to the DMO, it would also bring about an inflow of foreign exchange, leading to an increase in external reserves to help support the naira exchange rate as well as Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nIt further explained that when Nigeria raised funds externally through Eurobonds, it freed up space in the domestic market for private sector and sub-national borrowers.\n\nThe debt management body stated, \u201cIn effect, it helps the sovereign not to crowd out other borrowers in the domestic market. The issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria has opened up opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s corporate sector, notably banks, to issue Eurobonds to raise capital in the ICM.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Power. It excites and incites. It can excite hope and strength, or incite tension, hate and bitterness. Why should the regional background of the next president be a vexatious issue, evoking threats and recriminations? Why should brothers be at daggers drawn with each other over the geography of power? What happened to gentlemanly ententes, negotiations and trade-offs? What happened to the Nigerian agenda \u2013 if there was ever one? Brothers sheathe thy swords.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the principal interest of acquiring power at the centre is to steer Nigeria and all Nigerians to a path of peace and development, why should the geography of power be such a caustic issue? If the interest of all Nigerians is of consequence why should the axial disposition of power be the minatory contention? Well, except the latent grail of obtaining power at the centre is to pursue regional and sectional agendas, I see no reason for the pyrotechnics and why we cannot come to an accord on where power should orbit in 2023.\n\nReally, leadership in Nigeria has been blighted by ethnic and religious blots. A new leader is elected, but he gets there and makes ethnic protectionism his pastime. So, Nigerians are wary because power is not deployed for the benefit of all, but for the convenience of a few. The north may be skittish that power orbiting to the south will be to its own detriment, and the south could be uneasy that power subsisting in the current axis will further diminish its interest \u2014 a clash of titanic interests and agendas. But what happened to the Nigerian agenda? One for all and all for one?\n\nSince we are cognisant of our problems; we know where the house started to cave in, is it not logical that we reach a consensus in the leadership value of the next president in 2023 \u2014 such as his antecedents, credentials, proven leadership and managerial abilities, demonstrated patriotism, expansiveness and respect for diversity \u2013 but with ethnic/regional background as a secondary value?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need a Nigerian president \u2013 not one that will be defined by his geographical or ethnic character. Yes, a president that will be utilitarian in the deployment of power for the benefit of all Nigerians. So, whether north or south, it will not matter where the president comes from; there will be a sense of belonging and national affability among a majority of Nigerians. We need the Nigerian agenda \u2013 not northern or southern agenda.\n\nThe pursuit of power should be for the protection and preservation of all. We made some mistakes in the past with successive leaderships; we should be bold enough to correct them. We cannot seek change, but persist in the same pigeonhole mentation. How do we reorder the system when we insist on the status quo because we want the pendulum to swing our way? We must be able to distinguish between primary and secondary value.\n\nSome prominent Nigerians and groups have been heating up the cauldron with their intemperate comments on the 2023 presidency. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum, was reported to have made some uncharacteristic comments on the geography of power in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaba-Ahmed reportedly said: \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before whether we are president or vice-president, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote who you want. Why should we accept a second-class position when we know we can buy a form and contest for first class and we will win? Why does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble because power comes from God. We inherited leadership and being honest is not being stupid. The north has pride; we are humble enough to know that we are going to run Nigeria with other people but we are not going to pay a second fiddle to anybody. We may not have the most robust economy, there are people who are trying to strangulate us even more than we are being strangled.\u2019\u2019\n\nI have followed the statements of Baba-Ahmed over the years and noticed his dispassionate assessment of polarising national matters. It is the reason I find his recent comments untoward. But besides Baba-Ahmed, other prominent persons and groups in the south have been suffusing their demand for power to the region with corrosive statements and threats. Brother should not threaten brother.\n\nNaturally, when leaders in the south make indecorous statements about power shifting to the region in 2023, it provokes a reaction from the other side. I think matters of this complexion require tact and diplomacy \u2013 not threats or counter threats. Even if most people agree that power should orbit to the south in 2023, there is still a need for popular consensus.\n\nWe all have to work together. Leaders only deepen the sectional fears and widen the chasm by making uncontrolled comments. Where the next president should come from is a collective decision, no region or group should be isolated or made to feel threatened over this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitical, religious, group and community leaders should be disciplined in their public comments on the 2023 presidency. They should know that there can only be an election if the country is peaceful and secure. They should not incite chaos with undisciplined statements.\n\nBy Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo\n\nTwitter/Instagram/Facebook: @FredrickNwabufo",

          "title": "Ventures Park launches larger hub in Abuja for its expanding user base",
          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nIn addition to technology enthusiasts and stakeholders, the campus is open to non-governmental organisations, international agencies such as the United Nations, as well as researchers and professors working in northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our users are in the startup ecosystem but we have a good mix of people that come, work, and interact with one another,\u201d Ventures Park CEO, Nkechi Oguchi said. According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Image credit: Supplied.\n\nBut why Abuja, and not Lagos, which is the epicentre of tech activity in Nigeria and where Ventures Platform has a \u201cvery active\u201d community? Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTechpoint Build 2021\n\nNetflix\u2019s free plan in Kenya\n\nMore on Nigeria\u2019s CBDC\n\nCartona\u2019s Series A\n\nTechpoint Build is coming!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you imagine a large gathering of tech enthusiasts, industry experts, and early-stage startup founders? Close your eyes and see one that involves industry conversations, exhibitions, startup idea pitches, funding, and networking with tech-savvy people and key players. Well done! You\u2019ve successfully imagined Techpoint Build.\n\nTechpoint Build has been held annually since 2017 to connect key players in the African startup community. The 2021 edition promises to be nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThemed The Next Frontier, this year\u2019s edition will focus on building frontiers that enable tech development for Africa and preparing ourselves to harness the opportunities across industries like edtech, healthtech, musictech, and fintech.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? This year\u2019s edition is set for January 22, 2022, and registration is free!!! Find more details here. And reserve your spot here.\n\nKenyans can now watch Netflix for free and without Ads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Netflix\n\nYes, you read right. US-based movie streaming platform, Netflix, announced on Monday that it had begun the rollout of a free Netflix plan for Kenyans. Is anyone thinking of relocating to Kenya yet?\n\nIt was announced in a blog post released on Monday, September 20, 2021. The platform\u2019s Director for Product Innovation, Cathy Conk, revealed that Android mobile phone users above 18 in the East-African country can now access one-quarter of movies and television shows on Netflix free of charge and without ads.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t said. The blog post said nothing about how long this free plan would be available and whether plans are in the works to extend this offer to other markets. However, Conk hinted at the most likely reason for this offering: free subscribers can upgrade to a paid subscription to access the platform\u2019s full catalogue of movies and shows.\n\nSugar for ants; ants for sugar. Considering a September 2021 Statista report projecting that there\u2019d be a total of 2.6 million Netflix subscribers in Africa by the end of the year, this move is probably to increase sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s subscriber figures and, in the long-term, increase paying subscribers.\n\nViability? With 2,424,857 (17.6%) of Kenya\u2019s 13,777,600 young people \u2014 excluding students, homemakers, and those discouraged from looking for work \u2014 currently unemployed, there might not be such a significant increase in paying subscribers. Beyond the subscription fee, unaffordable Internet is a bigger factor to consider.\n\nA good time to revisit: Why Netflix needs more than cheap plans to drive massive growth in Africa\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBN urges businesses to adopt eNaira afore launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eNaira will launch on the 1st of October, 2021\n\nCBN breathing \ud83d\udd25. Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has said that the eNaira must be accepted as legal tender in the same way as the country\u2019s fiat currency.\n\nPer Punch, CBN Director for Payment System Management, Musa Jimoh, stated that following its launch, the eNaira must be accepted as a form of payment by all merchants and business outlets.\n\nRecall that in July, it was announced that the eNaira is set to launch on October 1, 2021. The digital currency, which won\u2019t be different from fiat and won\u2019t be inflation-proof, will be regulated by the CBN, the same body regulating the Naira. Think free transfers and more cashless transactions.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take my word for it; read How Nigeria\u2019s eNaira will work\n\nQuestions around user privacy, workings of cross-border payments, and taxing model should be answered when it launches.\n\nEgypt-based Cartona raises $4.5m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Egyptian eCommerce startup, Catorna, has announced raising $4.5 million in a Series A round led by Dubai-based venture capital firm, Global Ventures. Other participants include Kepple Africa, T5 Capital, and some angel investors.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Cartona? Mahmoud Talaat (CEO), Mahmoud Abdel-Fattah, and Rafik Zaher founded Cartona in August 2020. The startup directly connects retailers to wholesalers, manufacturers, and Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies via its mobile application.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the startup, which has over 30,000 merchants on its platform, has processed more than 400,000 orders.\n\nTalaat believes that the platform\u2019s fully asset-light model differentiates it from other startups \u2014 like MaxAB and Capiter \u2014 with similar offerings in Egypt as it works best for all stakeholders in the country\u2019s eCommerce space.\n\nThe funding will go into improving their technological infrastructure for the supply chain in the retail market and further Egyptian expansion into Cairo and Alexandria.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nHeterogeneous Opinions Do Not Have To Collide.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to reliable, affordable, and constant power supply has continuously been a problem in sub-Saharan Africa for a long time, impairing economic growth. As the population in the region increases, the enormity of the problem becomes more evident.\n\nIn Energy in Africa Challenges and Opportunities by Manfred Hafner and Simone Tagliapietra Lucia de Strasser, in 2018, about 600 million people out of 1.07 billion in sub-Saharan Africa did not have access to electricity.\n\nWhile there are efforts to increase access to electricity, population growth outpaces these efforts.\n\nInterestingly, some parts of Africa have high connection rates. According to Afrobarometer, Egypt has a 100% connection rate, South Africa, 95%; and Nigeria, 90%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s high percentage access differs greatly from its 17% supply rate. This means that electrical connections to people\u2019s houses and businesses do not translate to regular power supply.\n\nSadly, in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the case is either a high connection rate with little supply or a low connection rate with adequate supply and sometimes neither. An example is Burundi, with less than 25% connection rate and a supply rate below 19%.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s population and need for economic growth increase, the need for a reliable and sustainable energy source also rises.\n\nIn its Energy Outlook 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Africa predicts that the continent\u2019s population will surpass China\u2019s by 2025, making it critical to meet its energy demands.\n\nConnecting 600 million people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZOLA Electric Co-Founders. Image source: Digest Africa\n\nAfrica\u2019s electricity problems are not new, and companies are continuously developing tech solutions to solve them.\n\nZOLA Electric is one such company. It started when American Co-founder, Xavier Helgesen, an American, went hitchhiking in Malawi.\n\nWhile in Malawi, Helgesen spent time with a family in a fishing village on the shores of Lake Malawi. After discovering that the family lit their home with kerosene lanterns, he had an epiphany and immediately decided to work on a solution to the continent\u2019s electricity problem.\n\nDuring his master\u2019s programme at the University of Oxford, England, Helgesen researched solar power. It was there he met two other Americans \u2014 Erica Mackey, who had worked in Tanzania, and Joshua Pierce, a renewable energy expert \u2014 with whom he co-founded ZOLA Electric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether they devised a plan to provide affordable solar solutions for Africans, and in 2012, they launched ZOLA Electric first as Off-Grid Electric in Tanzania.\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s CEO, Bill Lenihan, tells Techpoint Africa that the drive to create the company came from the Co-founders passion \u201cto solve a big problem [since] 2.2 billion people across the planet do not have access to reliable energy and those people tend to be the ones that need it the most.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lenihan, ZOLA Electric is not a solar company but one that enables solar. He describes it as a company that creates digital energy where users and suppliers get real-time information about their energy consumption.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to bring affordable energy and clean energy, and solar does its job there. However, the bigger issue is unreliability in these markets, and by definition renewables are unreliable, so the other key need to solve this is storage.\u201d\n\nHarshit Chatur, a Senior Director at integrated power company, NRG Energy, corroborates Lenihan\u2019s claims, saying renewables are uncontrollable supply resources.\n\n\u201cWhen the sun isn\u2019t shining, solar panels do not produce energy. When the wind isn\u2019t blowing, turbines do not produce either.\u201d\n\nLenihan believes ZOLA stands out as not being just a backup solution to Africa\u2019s energy crisis but a primary solution.\n\nHe says the solutions mostly available across Africa and South-East Asia are backup solutions. He cites the example of a Lagos home that is connected to the grid but needs a backup generator and an inverter \u2014 a costly solution that cannot ensure constant power.\n\nIn contrast, ZOLA Electric creates smart batteries that manage all power sources. Everything essentially goes through the battery while it intelligently switches power sources.\n\nZOLA Electric has a product called Infinity that takes power from solar panels, power grids, and other power sources. It then uses an installed software to switch to the most readily available energy source while simultaneously storing energy.\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s video demonstration shows that Infinity can detect changes in the environment if the power source is solar or power surges if the source is an electrical grid.\n\nLenihan describes it simply as an energy management system that works like a storage system but actually does more.\n\n\u201cIt takes data and manages it to whatever is the priority of that homeowner,\u201d he says.\n\nZOLA Electric sells its products through its partners, who, while serving as distributors, interact directly with customers.\n\nThey install the ZOLA Electric solutions and help with maintenance. Essentially, it\u2019s a business-to-business (B2B) model.\n\nJourney through the years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Digest Africa\n\nFor Lenihan, it has been a journey of building and pioneering new technology. Through the years, the company has learnt what is effective for the continent and what isn\u2019t.\n\nThe learning process began in Africa\u2019s rural areas, understanding what they truly needed and the most sustainable way to provide it.\n\n\u201cWe started with lights and phone chargers and then went on to power televisions. We moved to more urban on-grid settings where people wanted really productive use and big systems, so the energy apparatus became even more complex.\u201d\n\nDescribing it as a product journey, he admits that though there have been many mistakes, they\u2019ve also made significant progress.\n\nAfrica\u2019s energy market is quite complicated. Each country, city, and user has specific needs, and over the years, ZOLA Electric has worked on products so flexible that they address all those specific needs.\n\nIn addition to the journey of creating a flexible product, the company was simultaneously building a digital energy industry.\n\nAccording to Lenihan, the industry was new, and although they built alongside other companies such as M-Kopa, it is still a challenge forging an entire industry.\n\nHowever, the co-founders\u2019 passion, which is also evident in employees and partners, has consistently kept the company going. And Lenihan believes it will help the industry grow.\n\n\u201cWe need people who want to get it done.\u201d\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nTesla is currently the company\u2019s second-largest investor. This happened because California-based solar company, SolarCity, invested in ZOLA Electric \u201cabout five years ago,\u201d Lenihan clarifies.\n\nSolarCity was acquired by Tesla a few years later, making Tesla ZOLA Electric\u2019s second-largest shareholder.\n\nLenihan reveals what he proposes will become the distributed digital energy industry.\n\n\u201cI see a renewed focus by the world on energy equality and energy access, and I hope that the momentum that exists today for the world to support the emerging markets in building out an energy apparatus continues.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that distributed digital energy is going to be the solution for emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThe company currently provides power for over 1.5 million people in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Nigeria.\n\nWhile Lenihan claims ZOLA Electric creates primary energy solutions, they still depend on other energy sources.\n\nHe admits that the company\u2019s product set doesn\u2019t completely solve the problem, but in a few years, the company will develop one that addresses all concerns.\n\nThough he sees a bright future for the industry, he maintains it will not be easy.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be 2.2 billion people without access to reliable energy if it were easy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, innovation should not be associated with only these large-scale projects.\n\nThe education sector offers countless opportunities for change that can impact students, parents, and educators for years to come. It\u2019s safe to say that education is responsible for innovation, and without it, the process will be dysfunctional.\n\nSo, a goal of the next frontier discussion will be to uncover the strategies for operating in the connected economy, and how the relationship between IT and education is changing to support new business models based on collaboration and engagement.\n\nAudience\n\nStartups in education\n\nMinistries of education\n\nIT businesses\n\nEducational institutions\n\nThe Next frontier in the Health Industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation in healthcare takes many forms.

There have been several attempts and one of the promises I made during my electioneering was that before leaving office, I was going to make Edo like modern cities in the world, making Edo people experience a retail shopping mall in the state.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the project is a public-private partnership and when completed, the government would sell its shares to Edo people.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are very pleased and happy with our partners, Persianas. We thank the chairman, who built the first Shoprite in Nigeria. For our administration, it\u2019s all about partnerships. This is what we call a classic public-private partnership between the government and the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to keep any interest. Once the mall is built, the government intends to sell its own interests to Edo people who are interested in being part-owners. Our role is to ensure and enable transactions like this to take place in the state.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cWe are bringing back industries and transactions of this nature to the state. We are stimulating investment into the state and when the businesses are set up, the government will withdraw because it has no business in running businesses.\n\n\u201cEdo has a unique location, fertile land and lots of mineral resources. We are repositioning the state to attract investors to take advantage of these opportunities; we are making sure our investment climate is friendly, attractive and supportive.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Persianas Nigeria Limited, Mr. Tayo Amusan said, \u201cWe are excited to bring Shoprite to Edo State. We have the experience to do business in the state, as we have done JARA stores in conjunction with the Edo State Government.\u201d\n\nAmusan expressed satisfaction with the developmental strides of the Obaseki-led administration, commending the governor for prioritizing the welfare and livelihoods of Edo people.\n\n...",

Abdulwahab Eyitayo.\n\nEyitayo said the terrorists surrendered from their enclaves in Sambisa Forests, as well as other hideouts.\n\nEyitayo, who is also the Commander, Sector 1, Operation Hadin Kai, disclosed this during a visit by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu and a team of Defence Correspondents form Abuja on Tuesday, in Maiduguri.\n\nAccording to him, the surrender by the repentant terrorists was a welcome development.\n\nAccording to him, one of the reasons they are surrendering in droves is the overwhelming fire power from the troops.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is because every man\u2019s endeavour is motivated by his family\u2019s wellbeing, that is why they are coming out with their families. We started seeing the signs from June.\n\n\u201cOur intensified operations had blocked their logistics\u2019 routes and supplies, bombardments all over, that is why they started surrendering and diseases have overpowered many of them.\n\n\u201cIt was better because in the end, the troops will clear all of them and their sympathisers combined,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOC warned that a time would come that the window of surrender would no longer be available, urging the sympathisers of the terrorists to encourage them to come out.\n\nHe added that whoever supported the enemies of the state would also be treated as an enemy by the state forces.\n\nHe said the military was more determined than ever to deal decisively with the terrorists and their supporters, NAN reported.\n\nOn the handling of the surrendered terrorists, Eyitayo disclosed that the Nigerian army was responsible for receiving, profiling or screening of the terrorists.\n\nThe GOC stated that afterwards, they would be handed over to the Borno government for further action.\n\nHe explained that a sizeable number of the surrendered, comprised wives and children of the terrorists, as well as those that were forcefully recruited into their folds.\n\nEarlier, the director, army public relations, said the media tour was part of efforts to counter the wrong narratives and apprehensions generated by recent surrenders of the terrorists.\n\nNwachukwu acknowledged and commended efforts of the troops in putting pressure on the terrorists to abandon their illicit activities.",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nProfit taking on floor of the Nigerian Exchange by investors is creating good BUY opportunities as prices of stocks keep coming down. The lower the price, the better for entry.\n\nIf investment in stocks is treated as normal transaction of buying and selling, the best for an investor at any point in time is an entry at relatively comfortable price, with the mindset for an exit at higher price level than the entry. At that, due considerations are needful at the entry and close monitoring in the process of holding the stock. These are essentials seeing that market trends and fundamentals do change and in most cases, in the opposite direction to performances of specific companies.\n\nThe following stocks have great potentials:\n\nACCESS BANK\n\nCurrently trading at N8.9, Access Bank has a year high of N10.5 and a year low of N6.25. It is trading 15.24% away from its year high of N10.50.\n\nWith a Book Value of N21.82, relative to the current price of N8.9 shows that the stock is under-priced and therefore has uptrend potential.\n\nFBNH\n\nThe share price of the big elephant is currently trading at N7.50 with a year high of N9 and a year low of N4.50. It is trading 16.67% away from its 52 weeks high of N9.\n\nGoing by its Book Value of N21.51, relative to its current share price of N7.55, FBNH is considered very cheap.\n\nUBA\n\nThe share price of UBA is currently trading at N7.65 and it has touched a high of 9.80 and a low of N5.80 in the last 52 weeks. It is trading 21.94% away from its 52 weeks high of N9.80.\n\nWith the Book Value of N22, relative to the current price of N7.60, UBA is considered cheap.\n\nZENITH BANK\n\nZenith Bank closed yesterday at N22.95. It is trading 19.47% away from its 52 weeks high of N28.50, which suggest an uptrend potential for the share price of the bank.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s Book Value at N36.42 relative to its current share price of N22.95 make the stock a bargain.\n\nFIDELITY BANK\n\nCurrently trading at N2.40, the share price of the bank with the last 52 weeks has touched a high of N3.10 and a low of N1.75. It is trading 22.58% away from its 52 weeks high of N3.10, which suggests an upside potential for the stock.\n\nWith Q2 2021 earnings per share of 67 kobo, a low P.E ratio of 3.58x and earnings yield of 27.92% makes it very attractive.\n\nWith the Book Value of N9.43, relative to the current price of N2.4, Fidelity Bank is considered cheap.\n\nOKOMU OIL\n\nOkomu Oil is now trading at N104, which means you can even get it lower than N100 during trading day especially when you are getting bulky units. It is still a very good buy.\n\nBUA CEMENT\n\nBUA Cement has been on offer at N61.20 which is the 10% limit down. By the time information hit BUA Cement, you will not see it at N61.20.\n\nCOURTVILLE\n\nCourtville Business Solution\u2019s Q1 and Q2 results were encouraging. If is true that they have gotten other State Government\u2019s patronage, their Q3 will be better than previous performance.\n\nBOC GASES\n\nBOC Gases has changed over management as it has been acquired by TY Danjuma. With the position of TY Danjuma in the Company, what he was able to achieve in May and Baker, he will also be able to bring to BOC Gases",

When you list the world\u2019s 10 big banks, six are in China. The banking sector is very important because, without money, we cannot build our industries,\u201d Jianchin said\n\n\u201cWhat I am thinking here is best to talk to the governor of the central bank, and how we can allow the Chinese banks to run office here and now, they are doing the feasibility studies on that.\n\n\u201cI am working hard that in the binational meeting, I hope we can make a big decision and give a big push to let the banking industry and insurance industry because financial integration and institutions are key,\u201d Mr Jianchin added. \u201cIf you go to China, you will find our banking industry is very powerful, not only for business but a change in the way of life.\n\nExtolling the extant China-Nigeria trade relations, the Chinese ambassador noted that the trade volume between China and Nigeria was nearly $20 billion, increasing from 2020\u2019s $19.2 billion.\n\nAccording to Mr Jianchin, the 2021 celebration is special as it coincides with the 50th anniversary of China-Nigeria\u2019s bilateral relations and that the countries share October 1 national day.\n\nHe disclosed that the Chinese embassy would honour 50 Nigerian employees of Chinese companies in Nigeria for their outstanding performance and contribution to strengthening diplomatic ties",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum has said that it regretted that it got rid of then-President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 elections to vote in the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nThe group expressed disappointment that Buhari has let down millions of Nigerians including members of the All Progressives Congress who trusted in his leadership prior to the poll six years ago.\n\nNEF, therefore, said that the next President of Nigeria should be one who would act in the \u201copposite direction\u201d of Buhari, who hails from Katsina, North-West Nigeria.\n\nNEF Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, spoke on Tuesday when he featured on Arise TV\u2019s \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 breakfast programme\n\nHe said, \u201cIs there any Nigerian who is not disappointed in President Buhari including diehard APC people? Is there anybody who would not tell you he wished President Buhari had done much better?\n\n\u201cWe raised huge expectations, we told people, \u2018Get rid of Jonathan, put Buhari there, he would fix corruption, he would fix insecurity, he would fix the economy\u2019 (but) look at where we are now.\n\n\u201cHow can anybody say they are happy with the record of President Buhari, even the people very close to him would tell you that they wished he could have done much better and he could have done much better and he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2018Next president should act in opposite direction of Buhari\u2019\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman said Nigeria needs a President who would act in the \u201copposite direction\u201d of Buhari in terms of economic policies, security, amongst others.\n\n\u201cSo, what we need to do now is to get ready to elect another President who would go in the opposite direction, a President who has a vision and a clear idea of what governance involves rather than just being a President. So, I am disappointed and that is why today, I am actively involved in trying to see that a new leader emerges in getting Nigerians a new lease of life,\u201d Baba-Ahmed noted.\n\nNegotiate, don\u2019t demand, NEF tells Southern Govs\n\nSpeaking further, Baba-Ahmed said the north had lived under Southern Presidents \u2014 Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan \u2014 since Nigeria\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nHe, however, said Southern Governors should not make the 2023 Presidency a matter of disagreement amongst Nigerians, noting that they should negotiate rather than demand the number one seat. The 17 Southern Governors at their meetings in Lagos and Enugu lately had insisted that power must return to the South in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have lived under Southern Presidents because we recognise that Nigeria is made up of sections, ethnic groups and interests. We recognise that, we are northerners, pluralism is in our DNA, we accept that, we live with it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make the issue of Presidency a matter over which Nigerians would fight and threaten the country and the democratic process, that is very dangerous for this country,\u201d the NEF spokesman stated.\n\nBaba-Ahmed also insisted that the north has the numerical strength in any election, adding that those doubting the north\u2019s voting power should check the last elections, claiming that millions of southerners voted for northern candidates during the elections.\n\nHe, however, said though the north has the numerical strength, neither the north nor the south can solely produce a President without the help of other parts of the country.\n\n\u2018APC, PDP not answer for 2023\u2019\n\nAlso, the NEF spokesman said that Nigeria needs a President who realises the need to rebuild the country, secure Nigerians and boost the economy from the downward slope.\n\n\u201cThe nation needs a leader that would do the things that President (Muhammadu) Buhari hasn\u2019t done, create inclusiveness, address resentment and frustration in other parts of the country and in the north and speak and act for everybody,\u201d he added.\n\nThe elder statesman, however, regretted that both the ruling APC and the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, have no answers to what Nigerians want in a candidate in 2023.\n\nHe noted that the \u201csmaller parties\u201d should be given the opportunity to field candidates with the character and capacity to lead Nigeria from all her current woes.",

          "text": "The incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) will bring about the desired openness and accountability in the running of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry and speed up efforts to reactivate the redundant refineries.\n\nThese, among others, were the views expressed Tuesday by some analysts who spoke to Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nBuhari\u2019s power under PIA\n\nLast Sunday, President Muhammadu Buhari directed the incorporation of the NNPC Limited as provided in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThe president\u2019s directive was in line with Section 53(1) of the PIA, which requires him as the minister of petroleum resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of commencement of the Act in consultation with the finance minister on the nominal shares of the company.\n\nBuhari, therefore, directed Mele Kyari, the group managing director of the NNPC, to take necessary steps to ensure the incorporation of the NNPC Limited is consistent with the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\nSimilarly, President Buhari appointed Ifeanyi Ararume as NNPC board chairman while Kyari and Umar I. Ajiya are chief executive officer and chief financial officer respectively.\n\nUnder Section 59(2), the PIA also gives the president the power to approve the appointment of the Board and Management of the NNPC Limited, with effect from the date of incorporation of the company.\n\nReactions\n\nCommenting on the new status of the NNPC, a political economist and development researcher, Mr Olamilekan Adefolarin, commended the President saying incorporating the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) would make for greater transparency and accountability in the running of the Corporation.\n\nAdefolarin told Blueprint that with the signing of the PIA by the president and incorporation of the NNPC, relative harmony would be brought to the oil and gas sector of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe also said this would put an end to all the political and economic scheming, intriguing and compromises.\n\nThe analyst expressed confidence that the move would drive competitiveness and bring the much needed dividend to the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt would help in revamping the obsolete refineries. This, we hope could come from focused investment and opportunity from anticipated investors.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the corporation has been accused of not being ambitious. However, with the reality of its incorporation, the NNPC is now set for optimal performance. Furthermore, with the Corporation incorporated, Nigerians should expect a paradigm shift from many years of management decadence of the state-controlled oil and gas sector, just as it would also open the sector for quality FDI. It would bequeath a worthwhile heritage to future generations.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said the incorporation of the NNPC would not in itself be a magic bullet that would cure decades of wanton corruption and mismanagement, warning that the corporation must avoid unviable transaction and crude exploration deals.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, debt incurrence could be another pitfall of the corporation. In this case, with high expectations and drive to expand its investment stock, borrowing and revenue not equal to debt could hamper the corporation\u2019s dividend.\n\n\u201cEssentially, it must build a broad national business consensus of understanding the problems in the international oil arena in order to be able to deploy appropriate policy actions. We hope the corporation would canvas for critical attention for crude oil refinery business in Nigeria vigorously,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking to one our correspondents, an economist, Mr Friday Efih, said it is better late than never.\n\nAccording to him, the opaque nature of affairs in the Corporation would gradually be laid to rest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good directive by the president. We should put everything in place in order to attract investments into the sector. It shows the authorities have finally realised that the country can get more from its oil and gas sector.\n\nIn his view, a legal practitioner, Charles Edo, said incorporation of the NNPC is an indication that the administration is committed to the implementation of the PIA.\n\n\u201cIt is a good step in the right direction towards the implementation of the petroleum Industry Act,\u201d Edo told Blueprint.\n\nAmendments to PIA\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has written the National Assembly on proposed Administrative Structure Amendments to the PIA 2021.\n\nIn the letter to President of the Senate Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, the president said: \u201cHaving carefully reviewed the administrative structure of both the Commission and the Authority, I would like to propose the following amendments: A. Appointment of Non-Executive Board Members; B. Removal of the Ministries of Petroleum and Finance from the Board of the two institutions; C. Appointment of Executive Directors.\u201d\n\nHe also said the PIA 2021 provided for the appointment of two non-executive members for the board of the two regulatory institutions, stressing that the membership limitation had not addressed the principle of balanced geopolitical representation of the country.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, pray for the intervention of the 9th Assembly to correct this oversight in the interest of our national unity,\u201d he added.\n\nIf approved, \u201cit will increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six: one person from each of the geopolitical zones of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also said the proposed amendment would increase the membership of the board from nine to 13, and strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread, and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning already have supervision or inter-governmental relations, and can continue to perform such roles without being in the board.\n\nOn the appointment of executive directors, President Buhari stressed the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments.\n\nHe said this would ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for employees of the Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority .\n\nHe said the proposed amendments to the PIA 2021 is strictly about the structure and aimed at ensuring smooth take-off and consequent growth of the two institutions.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendment will increase the membership of the board from nine to 13, that is, representing 44 per cent expansion on both sides. This competition will strengthen the institutions and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or intergovernmental relations that will continue to perform such roles without being in the board. It is also important to note that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be directors in the same rank in the institutions\n\n\u201c(c) Appointment of executive directors. The Act has made provisions for seven departmental heads in the authority to be known as executive directors. The appointment will also be subject to Senate\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is invited to note the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure effective management of the revenue generating institutions through uniform implementation of public service roles for employees in the authority.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendments to the PIA which is aimed at laying safe administrative structures governed by simple operational laws that will ensure smooth take-off and consequent growth of the two institutions and also in line with this administration\u2019s commitment to carry out petroleum reforms,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\nIn yet another letter, President Buhari also sought the Senate\u2019s confirmation of the Board of the Upstream Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn the letter dated September 16, 2021 and read during plenary by the Senate President, said the request sought for confirmation the Chairman, Chief Executive and Executive Directors for the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nThis, he said, was in accordance with the provision of Section 34(3) of the PIA 2021.\n\nThe nominees for confirmation into the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Board are: Idaere Gogo Ogan (Chairman); Engr. Sarki Auwalu (Chief Executive); Abiodun A. Adeniji (Executive Director, Finance and Accounts); and Ogbugo Ukoha (Executive Director, Distributions Systems, Storage and Retail Infrastructure).\n\nAlso in another letter dated September 16, 2021, President Buhari while relying on the provision of Section 11(3) of the Act sought the lawmakers\u2019 confirmation for his nominees for Chairman, Chief Executive and Executive Commissioners to the Board of the Upstream Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe nominees for confirmation are: Isa Ibrahim Modibo (Chairman); Engr. Gbenga Komolafe (Chief Executive); Hassan Gambo (Executive Commissioner, Finance and Accounts); and Ms Rose Ndong (Executive Commissioner, Exploration and Acreage Management).\n\nAccording to the President, both requests for the confirmation of the board\u2019s membership were made \u201cin order to fast track the process for the establishment of the Commission.\u201d",
          "summary": "Similarly, President Buhari appointed Ifeanyi Ararume as NNPC board chairman while Kyari and Umar I. Ajiya are chief executive officer and chief financial officer respectively.\nHe also said this would put an end to all the political and economic scheming, intriguing and compromises.\nHe said this would ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for employees of the Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority .\nThe nominees for confirmation into the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Board are: Idaere Gogo Ogan (Chairman); Engr.\nGbenga Komolafe (Chief Executive); Hassan Gambo (Executive Commissioner, Finance and Accounts); and Ms Rose Ndong (Executive Commissioner, Exploration and Acreage Management).",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has cautioned against politicising the open grazing controversy, saying the new law banning the activity in the southern states of Nigeria is not implementable.\n\nSome southern states like Ondo, Oyo, Lagos, Enugu and Osun, as well as the northern state of Benue, among others, have passed the anti-open grazing law.\n\nThe southern governors\u2019 decision was an outcome of a series of meeting held in Asaba (Delta state), Lagos and Enugu states.\n\nSpeaking to journalists Tuesday after a meeting with officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja, Governor El-Rufai said while it is true that herders must not continue with the old practice of roaming about with cattle, the remedy is not in making the laws that may not be able to be implemented.\n\nRather, he said, it lies in carefully planning for a solution which is the establishment of ranches.\n\nHe said the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) agreed that the way to go is ranching.\n\nThe governor said, already, his government had started the establishment of a ranch in Kaduna which he said, would accommodate about 1,500 Fulani herders and their families.\n\n\u201cThe Northern state Governors Forum has already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production. And we must move towards ranching.\n\n\u201cBut moving towards ranching cannot be done overnight. We have to have a plan, we have to have resources and we have to implement it sensibly. It is not a matter of populist legislation or saying that tomorrow this or that. It is not a solution. We have taken a position as northern state governors and we are implementing that.\n\n\u201cAnd in my state for instance, we are developing a huge ranch to centralise the herders. And that is the solution, a long term. But can it be done overnight? No.\n\n\u201cThis project we are doing will cost us about 10 billion naira. The CBN is supporting us with about N7.5 billion. And it will take about two years to do. We will be settling about 1,500 Fulani herders\u2019 families. And I hope that they will see that there are alternative ways of producing livestock instead of running up and down with cattle going to people\u2019s farms to cause all kinds of problems. We want to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cWhat is unhelpful is to politicise the situation and pass legislation that you know that you cannot implement. So, we have taken a position and we are working round the clock to implement that position.\n\n\u201cAnd these herders emanate from the north and we are going to centralise them. We cannot do it overnight. We need billions of naira. This is just one ranch that is costing N10 billion. I have 14 grazing reserves in Kaduna state and I will like to convert into ranching. Do I have 14 x 10 billion naira? I don\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government will give me N140 billion, I will convert the other 13 into ranches and make sure that nobody comes out with a cow or sheep in Kaduna state because I will have enough ranches to take care of everybody. That is the solution. You can legislate, but let us wait and see. And I wish them the best of luck.\u201d\n\nThe governor also weighed in on the ongoing contention between the governments of Rivers and Lagos states and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) over who is supposed to collect the Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nAccording to him, some people think that VAT is the same thing as Sales Tax, insisting that they are different because VAT is a \u2018special kind of tax.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe took a position in the Nigeria Governors Forum not to comment on the VAT issue because it is still going through the court. And until the Supreme Court makes a final pronouncement on the matter, anything that you see today can be changed. Even the states that have passed legislation, the Supreme Court can override them. So, I am reluctant to comment on it.\n\n\u201cBut people think that VAT is a sales tax. It is not. VAT is a special kind of tax. And there are many ways to look at it and I am sure that the appropriate time the Nigeria Governors Forum will look at it and take a position. But until then, I am reluctant to comment on a matter that is still going through judicial process,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Mailafia: Silencing the voices of the Middle belt -NigPilot",
          "text": "Nigerians received the news of the demise of the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Dr Obadiah Mailafia at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital Gwagwalada, Abuja, with a great shock. But the numbness soon changed to anger when details of the circumstances surrounding his death were made public by the National Publicity Secretary of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr Isuwa Dogo.\n\nAccording to Dr Dogo, \u201cDr. Mailafia arrived in Abuja last Sunday, September 12, 2021, from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife. On arrival at home, the wife noticed he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria. After three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday, September 17, 2021, where he was shabbily treated. It took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him.\n\n\u201cDr. Mailafia was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital, and EHA Clinics. The wife opted for the third choice. On arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him. After few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case.\n\n\u201cThe wife opposed the decision and insisted that she was opposed to the idea of taking her husband to Gwagwalada. Mailafia\u2019s wife only succumbed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad will happen to her husband. Yesterday, Saturday, September 18, 2021, Dr. Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada. on arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr. Mailafia was not on duty. Even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing goes wrong. The wife of the former CBN Deputy Governor was asked to pay the sum of N600\u2019000 as a deposit even when it was a referral case, with an accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN. At a point, Dr. Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him on a ventilator.\n\n\u201cThe doctors flatly refused. Even after the doctors declared Dr. Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr Mailafia\u2019s son that is living abroad, had directed a family member who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN Deputy Governor, to mount pressure on the chest of Dr. Mailafia for resuscitation and thereafter place him on life support. The doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Dr. Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they have already pronounced him dead. Even when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead. While the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr. Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death.\u201d\n\nAs a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression. The economist was never afraid to speak truth to power just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides. In the twilight of his life, this consummate technocrat and global scholar of repute beamed his searchlight on the raging insecurity ravaging our country. He expressed regrets over the government\u2019s incapacity to rein in the activities of insurgents and criminal groups terrorizing the nation. As a former presidential candidate in the 2019 poll, Dr. Mailafia sought to deploy politics to bring about the dream he had for his country. Even after he lost the election, he never let down the bar in demanding fair treatment for all Nigerians.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum recalled his patriotic zeal in standing up for truth and justice.\n\n\u201cHe was never a letdown in being at the forefront of showing the way for national greatness as he was willing to lay down his life for Nigeria. The Forum is inspired by his altruistic disposition and contributions to national development.\u201d\n\nSeveral Nigerians have called for probe into the circumstances surrounding the death of this outstanding Nigerian from the Middle Belt who devoted his life to the emancipation of near voiceless minorities in the North. The demand for a probe into Dr Mailafia\u2019s death is reinforced by the fact that several months before his demise he raised the alarm that his life is at stake.\n\nIn September 2020, the late former CBN deputy governor was the subject of attention following an invitation he got from the Department of State Service, DSS over his statement on radio that a governor in the North-West part of the country was sponsoring bandits in the region. The invitation by the DSS sparked mixed reactions.\n\nMailafia had issued a statement claiming that his life was in danger \u201cfor speaking on behalf of the holy martyrs \u2014 of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly and youths that have been killed in our beloved country\u201d.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after his interrogation at the Jos office of the SSS, Dr Mailafia said \u201cI had indicated that I have reason to believe that my life has been in danger. I have no conclusive proof, but I got threats in where I was staying on Thursday because I saw some strange people at the gate trying to break in. I jumped the fence and escaped because I didn\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nThe death of the Middle Belt activist barely two weeks after declaring that the Fulanisation agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari is real is also a source of concern to Nigerians with the lackadaisical manner he was treated in the hospital and the refusal of the medical team to do everything within their professional competence to save him.\n\nSpeaking on September 5 during a special session organized by Forum for Good Governance Towards Revival for All Nations (TRANS 21) with the theme \u201cThe Role of the Church in Nation Building\u201d Dr Mailafia alleged the present administration in Nigeria of pushing for the Islamisation and Fulanisation of the country.\n\nMalaifia said \u201cThe kind of Islam that is coming from Sahara is dangerous. They want to take over your land and enslave you. Christians must rise to protect it. They want to take over your land and enslave you.\n\n\u201cIn the North East alone, more than 3000 churches have been destroyed, more than 400 priests and pastors have been killed. Last year, the CAN chairman of Adamawa was beheaded, even after a ransom was paid. We have been told that the so call bandits, who should not be called bandits because bandits do not bring down military aircraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo bandit has the capacity to bring down military aircraft. No bandit has the power to attack Nigeria Defence Academy which is the premier institution for the training of armed forces. No bandit has the capacity to do that, only terrorists have the capacity to do that.\n\n\u201cWe are being told that this terrorists are part of the insurgency because they did these kidnappings to raise money in order to fund the insurgency.\u201d\n\nOn the state of the nation, the Development Economist said all indications pointed to the fact that Nigeria is drifting towards a failed state, saying that the country may soon become ungovernable if nothing is done to check the drift as the country under President Buhari.\n\nHe specifically said the country is moving towards the domination of one ethnic group and religion over the other, while Nigeria has fallen from the grace being the most terrorised nation and the poverty capital of the world after India and Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to him, about two million Nigerians have been killed silently in Nigeria in the last few years with the government unable to tackle the menace of Fulani herdsmen, terrorists and bandits.\n\nHe said Nigeria parades about 90 million people who are poor with 50 percent of the figure from the North particularly the North-East and West geopolitical zones, noting Borno, Zamfrara and Yobe States accounted for 70 percent of the figure.\n\nMailafia said the situation in the North is getting out of hand with no fewer than 20 million of children out of school, lamenting the official unemployment rate in Nigeria is over 33 percent with youth forming 40 percent of the figure.\n\nMelaifia said \u201cNigeria is now a failed state, unable to perform its statutory roles. Nigeria cannot be described as a nation because the power is not concentrated in the hands of government alone. There are other blocs that now have power of coercion.\u201d\n\n\u201cRival groups control territory. Boko Haram is in control of over half of Niger State and if they successfully take over Niger, Abuja will be a walkover.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot provide security for the people. Nowhere is safe in the country. The forests have been taken over by foreign invaders.\n\n\u201cThe economy is collapsing. There is collapse of the institution. Police, Universities\u2019 standards are low. Corruption has taken over in the country. What else do we need to say Nigeria is a failed state?\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cNigeria has been designated as a failed state, we may not say it is a failed state but certainly it is surely exhibiting the features of a failed state in term of the kind of violence, the widespread insecurity, terrorism, abuse of humanity, criminality, rape, killing, maiming, destruction, we are a failing state, the solution is nothing than the need to give birth to a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the constitution we have presently is a fraud, it is a fraud because it starts with we the people when infact you and I did not sit anywhere to design this constitution, by this fact alone, it is based on lies and fraud.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people couldn\u2019t know that because former President Olusegun Obasanjo was a fair minded man and he was dedicated. Umar Masa Yardua (of blessed memory) was also a fair minded man, and because Goodluck Jonathan was a fair minded mind too.\n\n\u201cSo people could afford to live with fraudulent constitution, but now today we are seeing a fraudulent constitution in the hands of people who have hidden agenda, who hate our country, they have nothing to offer us.\n\n\u201cTherefore, on this basis, we must reject the evil we are seeing and we must demand for the re-engineering of our federation for the restructuring of our country so that we can have a new Nigeria anchor on social justice, fair representation for all the nationalities of this country and have a government based on transparency, justice and hope for all Nigerians and anchor on devolution of powers, this is the way forward.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after making these deep submissions on the state of the nation Dr Mailafia is no more. Frontline human rights group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Sunday demanded for a probe on the death of former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a critic of the current administration, Dr Obadiah Mailafiya, alleging that he may have been extra-legally killed.\n\nIn media release endorsed by the National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA regretted that Nigeria seems to have become the killer of her best citizens just as the Rights group said indeed persons who speak truth to power in the past six and half years have come under persistent attacks and pressure from forces embedded within the Nigerian Security Forces and the political class in charge of government at all levels to an extent that even the central ruling party, All Progressives Congress, has gone all out to try to sponsor many toxic, obnoxious and unconstitutional bills all aimed at curtailing the enjoyment of the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights recognised in chapter 4 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, exactly one year ago on September 11th 2020 at the height of the incessant harassment by the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police Force, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a critic of the current administration Dr Mailafiya raised alarm of death threat as follows: \u201cPlease, pray for me. I have reasons to believe that my life is in danger and that some powerful political forces want to silence me forever for speaking the truth. For speaking on behalf of the Holy Martyrs \u2014 of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly and youths that have been killed in our beloved country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are very unassailable reasons to believe that the alarm he raised which was never investigated may be the harbinger of his sudden demise in Abuja on Sunday September 19th 2021,\u201d argues the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria which is calling for independent investigation on his death.\u201d\n\nIt is not only the Middle Belt that lost an advocate of the masses but the entire nation and every Nigerian that is desirous of a just and equitable nation. Dr Mailafia\u2019s demise has left a huge vacuum amongst ethnic minorities in the entire nation and like the death of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, such vacuum may take decades to fill.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIt is not only the Middle Belt that lost an advocate of the masses but the entire nation and every Nigerian that is desirous of a just and equitable nation.",

On arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him. After few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case.\n\n\u201cThe wife opposed the decision and insisted that she was opposed to the idea of taking her husband to Gwagwalada. Mailafia\u2019s wife only succumbed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad will happen to her husband. Yesterday, Saturday, September 18, 2021, Dr. Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada. on arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr. Mailafia was not on duty. Even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing goes wrong. The wife of the former CBN Deputy Governor was asked to pay the sum of N600\u2019000 as a deposit even when it was a referral case, with an accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN. At a point, Dr. Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him on a ventilator.\n\n\u201cThe doctors flatly refused. Even after the doctors declared Dr. Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr Mailafia\u2019s son that is living abroad, had directed a family member who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN Deputy Governor, to mount pressure on the chest of Dr. Mailafia for resuscitation and thereafter place him on life support. The doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Dr. Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they have already pronounced him dead. Even when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead. While the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr. Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death.\u201d\n\nAs a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression. The economist was never afraid to speak truth to power just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides. In the twilight of his life, this consummate technocrat and global scholar of repute beamed his searchlight on the raging insecurity ravaging our country. He expressed regrets over the government\u2019s incapacity to rein in the activities of insurgents and criminal groups terrorizing the nation. As a former presidential candidate in the 2019 poll, Dr. Mailafia sought to deploy politics to bring about the dream he had for his country. Even after he lost the election, he never let down the bar in demanding fair treatment for all Nigerians.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum recalled his patriotic zeal in standing up for truth and justice.\n\n\u201cHe was never a letdown in being at the forefront of showing the way for national greatness as he was willing to lay down his life for Nigeria. The Forum is inspired by his altruistic disposition and contributions to national development.\u201d\n\nSeveral Nigerians have called for probe into the circumstances surrounding the death of this outstanding Nigerian from the Middle Belt who devoted his life to the emancipation of near voiceless minorities in the North. The demand for a probe into Dr Mailafia\u2019s death is reinforced by the fact that several months before his demise he raised the alarm that his life is at stake.\n\nIn September 2020, the late former CBN deputy governor was the subject of attention following an invitation he got from the Department of State Service, DSS over his statement on radio that a governor in the North-West part of the country was sponsoring bandits in the region. The invitation by the DSS sparked mixed reactions.\n\nMailafia had issued a statement claiming that his life was in danger \u201cfor speaking on behalf of the holy martyrs \u2014 of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly and youths that have been killed in our beloved country\u201d.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after his interrogation at the Jos office of the SSS, Dr Mailafia said \u201cI had indicated that I have reason to believe that my life has been in danger. I have no conclusive proof, but I got threats in where I was staying on Thursday because I saw some strange people at the gate trying to break in. I jumped the fence and escaped because I didn\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nThe death of the Middle Belt activist barely two weeks after declaring that the Fulanisation agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari is real is also a source of concern to Nigerians with the lackadaisical manner he was treated in the hospital and the refusal of the medical team to do everything within their professional competence to save him.\n\nSpeaking on September 5 during a special session organized by Forum for Good Governance Towards Revival for All Nations (TRANS 21) with the theme \u201cThe Role of the Church in Nation Building\u201d Dr Mailafia alleged the present administration in Nigeria of pushing for the Islamisation and Fulanisation of the country.\n\nMalaifia said \u201cThe kind of Islam that is coming from Sahara is dangerous. They want to take over your land and enslave you. Christians must rise to protect it. They want to take over your land and enslave you.\n\n\u201cIn the North East alone, more than 3000 churches have been destroyed, more than 400 priests and pastors have been killed. Last year, the CAN chairman of Adamawa was beheaded, even after a ransom was paid. We have been told that the so call bandits, who should not be called bandits because bandits do not bring down military aircraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo bandit has the capacity to bring down military aircraft. No bandit has the power to attack Nigeria Defence Academy which is the premier institution for the training of armed forces. No bandit has the capacity to do that, only terrorists have the capacity to do that.\n\n\u201cWe are being told that this terrorists are part of the insurgency because they did these kidnappings to raise money in order to fund the insurgency.\u201d\n\nOn the state of the nation, the Development Economist said all indications pointed to the fact that Nigeria is drifting towards a failed state, saying that the country may soon become ungovernable if nothing is done to check the drift as the country under President Buhari.\n\nHe specifically said the country is moving towards the domination of one ethnic group and religion over the other, while Nigeria has fallen from the grace being the most terrorised nation and the poverty capital of the world after India and Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to him, about two million Nigerians have been killed silently in Nigeria in the last few years with the government unable to tackle the menace of Fulani herdsmen, terrorists and bandits.\n\nHe said Nigeria parades about 90 million people who are poor with 50 percent of the figure from the North particularly the North-East and West geopolitical zones, noting Borno, Zamfrara and Yobe States accounted for 70 percent of the figure.\n\nMailafia said the situation in the North is getting out of hand with no fewer than 20 million of children out of school, lamenting the official unemployment rate in Nigeria is over 33 percent with youth forming 40 percent of the figure.\n\nMelaifia said \u201cNigeria is now a failed state, unable to perform its statutory roles. Nigeria cannot be described as a nation because the power is not concentrated in the hands of government alone. There are other blocs that now have power of coercion.\u201d\n\n\u201cRival groups control territory. Boko Haram is in control of over half of Niger State and if they successfully take over Niger, Abuja will be a walkover.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot provide security for the people. Nowhere is safe in the country. The forests have been taken over by foreign invaders.\n\n\u201cThe economy is collapsing. There is collapse of the institution. Police, Universities\u2019 standards are low. Corruption has taken over in the country. What else do we need to say Nigeria is a failed state?\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cNigeria has been designated as a failed state, we may not say it is a failed state but certainly it is surely exhibiting the features of a failed state in term of the kind of violence, the widespread insecurity, terrorism, abuse of humanity, criminality, rape, killing, maiming, destruction, we are a failing state, the solution is nothing than the need to give birth to a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the constitution we have presently is a fraud, it is a fraud because it starts with we the people when infact you and I did not sit anywhere to design this constitution, by this fact alone, it is based on lies and fraud.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people couldn\u2019t know that because former President Olusegun Obasanjo was a fair minded man and he was dedicated. Umar Masa Yardua (of blessed memory) was also a fair minded man, and because Goodluck Jonathan was a fair minded mind too.\n\n\u201cSo people could afford to live with fraudulent constitution, but now today we are seeing a fraudulent constitution in the hands of people who have hidden agenda, who hate our country, they have nothing to offer us.\n\n\u201cTherefore, on this basis, we must reject the evil we are seeing and we must demand for the re-engineering of our federation for the restructuring of our country so that we can have a new Nigeria anchor on social justice, fair representation for all the nationalities of this country and have a government based on transparency, justice and hope for all Nigerians and anchor on devolution of powers, this is the way forward.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after making these deep submissions on the state of the nation Dr Mailafia is no more. Frontline human rights group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Sunday demanded for a probe on the death of former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a critic of the current administration, Dr Obadiah Mailafiya, alleging that he may have been extra-legally killed.\n\nIn media release endorsed by the National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA regretted that Nigeria seems to have become the killer of her best citizens just as the Rights group said indeed persons who speak truth to power in the past six and half years have come under persistent attacks and pressure from forces embedded within the Nigerian Security Forces and the political class in charge of government at all levels to an extent that even the central ruling party, All Progressives Congress, has gone all out to try to sponsor many toxic, obnoxious and unconstitutional bills all aimed at curtailing the enjoyment of the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights recognised in chapter 4 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, exactly one year ago on September 11th 2020 at the height of the incessant harassment by the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police Force, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a critic of the current administration Dr Mailafiya raised alarm of death threat as follows: \u201cPlease, pray for me. I have reasons to believe that my life is in danger and that some powerful political forces want to silence me forever for speaking the truth. For speaking on behalf of the Holy Martyrs \u2014 of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly and youths that have been killed in our beloved country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are very unassailable reasons to believe that the alarm he raised which was never investigated may be the harbinger of his sudden demise in Abuja on Sunday September 19th 2021,\u201d argues the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria which is calling for independent investigation on his death.\u201d\n\nIt is not only the Middle Belt that lost an advocate of the masses but the entire nation and every Nigerian that is desirous of a just and equitable nation. Dr Mailafia\u2019s demise has left a huge vacuum amongst ethnic minorities in the entire nation and like the death of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, such vacuum may take decades to fill.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIt is not only the Middle Belt that lost an advocate of the masses but the entire nation and every Nigerian that is desirous of a just and equitable nation.",

A simple internet search would have availed Mr. Whoriskey of the judgment of the case and the present state of affairs. Further, questions 2-5 were directly extracted from untested allegations contained in a first amended verified complaint filed before the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division\u201d the groups alleged.\n\nThey called on media houses not to yield their platforms to people whose objectives were not noble as such would encourage unhealthy business rivalry. \u201cThere is a plethora of questions which The Washington Post rather has to answer and which directly calls to question its genuineness in permitting this to happen. It will be damning to the long-held image of The Washington Post that its staff have yielded the platform of the medium to the use for a global smear campaign and unhealthy business rivalry\u201d Mr. Tochukwu Ohazuruike who addressed the press was quoted as saying.\n\nIn answering the allegations against Mr. Peters, the groups claimed that \u201cMr. Peters has stated severally that he has never received any favour by way of facilitation or otherwise from Dieziani Alison-Madueke, and there was therefore nothing to be grateful for. He has severally denounced any such attempt to link the purchase of his property with Dieziani under such premises. His purchase of the furniture was in furtherance of his desire to furnish a property that belonged to him, and those furniture can be found, even today, at his said property at 58 Harley House. No furniture that belonged to him can be found at any other place other than in his property. The furniture found at the UK address of Dieziani Alison-Madueke does not belong to him, and certainly could not have been the same found in his said property at 58 Harley House.\u201d\n\nThey insist that the answers they provided should discourage future smear campaigns as this is not the first time it was happening saying \u201cwe hope that with these answers we would have satisfied Mr. Whoriskey and got him to alert his sponsors that the plot is dead on arrival and cannot be revived. We also say to all such persons who would in the future want to regurgitate these issues that the answers are already available in the public space as there is nothing hidden and there is nothing any media house can unearth again so no need taking any jobs from the sponsors of this smear campaign.\u201d",

He says they will address three key challenges \u2014 \u201csaving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better.\u201d\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tells the United Nations General Assembly that his government is against health passports, but backs drive to vaccinate against Covid-19 while saying he will be the \u201clast Brazilian\u201d to get jabbed.",

          "text": "President Joe Biden told the world on Tuesday that the United States is not seeking a new Cold War with China as he vowed to pivot from post-9/11 conflicts and take a global leadership role on crises from climate to Covid.\n\nAddressing the UN General Assembly for the first time as President, Biden promised to work to advance democracy and alliances, despite friction with Europe over France\u2019s loss of a mega-contract.\n\nThe Biden administration has identified a rising and authoritarian China as the paramount challenge of the 21st century, but in his United Nations debut, he made clear he was not trying to sow divisions.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThe United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to share challenges even if we have intense disagreement in other areas.\u201d\n\nBiden did not mention China by name, other than voicing alarm about human rights in Xinjiang, where experts say more than one million people from the Uyghur and other mostly Muslim populations are incarcerated.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is set to address the General Assembly later Tuesday but by video in light of Covid-19 precautions.\n\nBiden declared himself to be the first US president in 20 years not to be running a war after his controversial pullout of troops from Afghanistan, where the Taliban swiftly took over.\n\nInstead, America is \u201copening a new era of relentless diplomacy\u201d in which military power must be the \u201ctool of last resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mission must be clear and achievable, undertaken with informed consent of the American people and whenever possible in partnership with our allies,\u201d Biden said from the UN rostrum where previous US presidents, notably including George W. Bush, have pushed for military action.\n\n\u2018Recipe For Trouble\u2019\n\nOpening the General Assembly, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of growing divisions between the United States and China and urged dialogue.\n\n\u201cI fear our world is creeping towards two different sets of economic, trade, financial and technology rules, two divergent approaches in the development of artificial intelligence \u2014 and ultimately two different military and geopolitical strategies,\u201d Guterres said.\n\n\u201cThis is a recipe for trouble. It would be far less predictable than the Cold War.\u201d\n\nThe UN General Assembly is meeting in person for the first time in two years but at limited capacity and with pandemic precautions.\n\nThe measures include replacing the microphone after each speaker \u2014 likely welcome news for the 78-year-old Biden who spoke after Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who defied guidance only to attend if vaccinated.\n\nBiden has called a virtual summit on Wednesday on defeating the pandemic and teased that he will announce \u201cadditional commitments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek to advance the fight against Covid-19 and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on three key challenges: saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe also said Washington would double financing on climate change \u2014 a key element in reaching an ambitious new accord in November at a UN conference in Glasgow as temperatures and severe weather rise dangerously.\n\nThe United Nations says there is a $20 billion shortfall in the $100 billion fund that developed countries promised to mobilize annually from 2020-2025 for helping poorer nations adapt to climate change.\n\nFriction With Europe\n\nBiden will end a busy diplomatic week with an unprecedented four-way summit at the White House with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan \u2014 the so-called \u201cQuad\u201d widely seen as a united front against China.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s efforts to shore up alliances have faced one sudden and strong hurdle: France.\n\nParis recalled its ambassador to Washington in fury after Australia canceled a multibillion-dollar contract for French conventional submarines in favor of US nuclear versions as part of a new alliance announced with Washington and London.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said he will not meet one-on-one in New York with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and has described Biden\u2019s diplomatic style as \u201cbrutality.\u201d\n\nThe White House appears confident it can calm the spat, with Biden set to speak by telephone to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is not attending UNGA due to Covid precautions.\n\nBut German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who openly rejoiced in Biden\u2019s defeat of Donald Trump, voiced solidarity with France and called the submarine decision \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never under any illusion that we wouldn\u2019t have problems with the new American president,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, who is expected to address the assembly on Friday, is among about a hundred world leaders who attended the opening ceremony today.",

          "title": "Usyk Could Be Joshua\u2019s Toughest Test, Ex-World Champion Groves Says",
          "text": "Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua could face his toughest test yet when he fights Oleksandr Usyk in London on Saturday, says ex-world champion George Groves.\n\nJoshua, 31, puts his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO world heavyweight titles on the line against Usyk, a former undisputed cruiserweight world champion.\n\nThe 34-year-old Ukrainian has won all 18 professional fights, beating Tony Bellew and Derek Chisora on that run.\n\n\u201cTechnically, Usyk is brilliant,\u201d said Groves on the 5 Live Boxing podcast.\n\n\u201cHe showed that in unifying the cruiserweight division in great fights and I believe he could be Joshua\u2019s toughest test to date. This is the first fight when I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Joshua got beaten.\n\n\u201cJoshua has fought [Wladimir] Klitschko and been in with Joseph Parker and also been beaten [by Andy Ruiz] and the only question mark for Usyk is: Is he big enough to compete with AJ?\n\n\u201cIf Usyk keeps a high pace and makes Joshua miss with a lot of shots, that will work to Usyk\u2019s advantage as he has probably got a better engine.\n\n\u201cJoshua is a phenomenal athlete with tremendous punching power and strength but has a tendency to tire out if the pace is uncomfortable for him.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s fight from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live with full commentary from 22:00 BST.\n\nA crowd of more than 60,000 is expected and it will be the largest attendance Joshua has fought in front of since his win over Alexander Povetkin with 80,000 at Wembley Stadium in September 2018.\n\nSince then, Joshua has lost to Ruiz in New York before winning the rematch in Saudi Arabia and gained a ninth-round victory over Bulgaria\u2019s Kubrat Pulev at Wembley Arena last December, with only 1,000 fans attending because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBoth Joshua and Usyk won gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics, at super-heavyweight and heavyweight respectively, with the Briton going on to win 24 of his 25 professional fights, including 22 inside the distance.\n\nDillian Whyte, who lost to Joshua in 2015 and is pushing for a rematch with him or a shot at WBC champion Tyson Fury, believes the key to beating Usyk on Saturday is to adopt an attacking strategy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great fight and Joshua will stop him in the first six or seven rounds,\u201d Whyte told the 5 Live Boxing podcast.\n\n\u201cUsyk will start fast and Joshua should be cagey as Usyk is a bit lighter. Joshua can sometimes lack confidence but hopefully he goes back to the old him, starts pressing, being the bigger, stronger guy and gets the job done early.\n\n\u201cIf Joshua sets the pace, he can get an early knockout and if he is strong, confident and walks him down, then I don\u2019t see Usyk\u2019s punches troubling Joshua.\u201d\n\nGroves, who held the WBA super-middleweight belt in 2017 and 2018, added: \u201cIf I was Joshua, I would take control of the ring and try to dominate and bully off the front foot.\n\n\u201cUsyk will want to be off the back foot for the first couple of rounds, then try to pepper Joshua.\n\n\u201cIf I was in the Joshua camp, I would say: You want to keep this guy in his box. You don\u2019t want Usyk having any confidence, so hit him hard and early.\n\n\u201cIn the first three rounds, you want to land something big on him.\u201d\n\nPromoter Eddie Hearn also suggested Joshua could get an early victory.\n\nHearn said: \u201cI\u2019m always nervous for an Anthony Joshua fight, especially when you\u2019re fighting someone that really believes he is going to win.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re in the game for. If we win, the celebrations will be wild; if we lose, we will be gutted.\n\n\u201cAJ is comfortable with what he is doing, which is important in a fight like this, and he appreciates how tough this is.\n\n\u201cI think AJ wins by stoppage and that could happen early. AJ has to put dents in him early on.\u201d",

She opened it. I think they call that journalism.\u201d\n\nA New York Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said the newspaper\u2019s coverage of Mr Trump\u2019s taxes \u201chelped inform citizens through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest\u201d, and that the lawsuit was \u201can attempt to silence independent news organisations\u201d.\n\nLast year, Ms Trump filed her own lawsuit accusing Mr Trump and two family members of fraud and conspiracy, alleging that the then-president, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry and brother Robert Trump \u2013 who died last August \u2013 cheated her out of an inheritance.\n\nThat case is still pending.",

Expect aftershocks, stay away from damaged buildings and other hazards. Avoid driving, except for emergencies,\u201d the authority said.\n\nSurgeon Sameer Thakur said he had been performing a heart bypass operation in Geelong, near Melbourne, when the quake hit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of in the crux of the operation and we just felt the whole operating table move,\u201d he told BBC Newsday.\n\n\u201cLooking around the room, all the IV poles were moving and some of the clamps that we have, they were all shaking.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cfortunately we were at a stage where we could come to a halt\u201d until the shaking stopped, allowing them to complete the surgery.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation shared a clip of its breakfast TV presenters reacting in the studio as the earthquake hit.\n\n\u201cIs it an earthquake or a structural thing?\u201d presenter Michael Rowland was later shown asking producers. \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 that was a big one.\u201d\n\nSeveral high-rise towers and a city hospital were also briefly evacuated, residents reported. Some city tram lines had been suspended due to damage.\n\nSouth Australia Premier Stephen Marshall said his state had felt aftershocks.\n\nOne federal MP, Michael McCormack, said the \u201cground [was] shaking violently\u201d in Wagga Wagga, NSW.\n\nLarge earthquakes are uncommon in Australia because the continent lies centrally on a tectonic plate.\n\nThis quake struck at a shallow depth of 10km (6.5 miles), according to Geosciences Australia. It was initially measured at 6.0 magnitude before being revised to 5.9.\n\nThe geoscience agency says Australia experiences a potentially damaging earthquake \u2013 defined as above 6.0 magnitude \u2013 about every 10 years.\n\nMelbourne, the country\u2019s second largest city, is home to about five million people.\n\nThe city is currently in lockdown due to a recent wave of coronavirus cases.",

          "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that China would no longer fund the construction of new coal-fired power projects overseas, surprising the world on climate for the second straight year at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nChina has supported coal projects in developing countries including Indonesia and Bangladesh and has been under heavy diplomatic pressure to put an end to the financing to help the world meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nXi\u2019s announcement on Tuesday followed similar moves by South Korea and Japan earlier this year.\n\n\u201cChina will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,\u201d Xi said in a pre-recorded video address at the annual UN gathering.\n\nThe pledge came hours after United States President Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid to poorer nations to $11.4bn by 2024 to help those countries switch to cleaner energy and cope with global warming\u2019s worsening effects.\n\nAlthough Xi\u2019s speech was short on detail, the initiatives could provide some momentum going into COP26, the key global climate talks that are due to start in the Scottish city of Glasgow at the end of October.\n\n\u201cThis is an absolutely seminal moment,\u201d said Xinyue Ma, an expert on energy development finance at Boston University\u2019s Global Development Policy Center.\n\nIn the run-up to the historic 2015 Paris climate deal, a joint US-China agreement helped kick-start the successful negotiations.\n\nThe US climate envoy John Kerry quickly welcomed Xi\u2019s announcement, calling it a \u201cgreat contribution\u201d and a good foundation for success in Glasgow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to China for quite some period of time about this. And I\u2019m absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision,\u201d Kerry said in a statement.\n\nAlok Sharma, the British minister who is heading COP26, also hailed Xi\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cIt is clear the writing is on the wall for coal power. I welcome President Xi\u2019s commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad \u2013 a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nClimate campaigners also welcomed the pledge from the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2019, data shows that China was financing 13 percent of coal-fired power capacity built outside China \u2013 \u201cfar and away the largest public financier,\u201d according to Kevin Gallagher, who directs the Boston University centre.\n\nThe climate advocacy movement 350.org called Xi\u2019s announcement \u201chuge,\u201d saying it could be a \u201creal game-changer\u201d depending on when it takes effect.\n\nHelen Mountford, the vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said it was \u201ca historic turning point away from the world\u2019s dirtiest fossil fuel.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s pledge shows that the firehose of international public financing for coal is being turned off,\u201d she said but noted that Beijing continued to invest in coal at home.\n\nChina brought 38.4 gigawatts of new coal-fired power into operation last year \u2013 more than three times what was brought on line globally.\n\nNon-governmental groups in a letter earlier this year said the state-run Bank of China was the largest single funder of coal projects, providing $35bn since the Paris climate agreement.\n\nXi repeated pledges from last year that China would achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060.\n\nSome experts have criticised the targets as not ambitious enough, although the pledges allowed Beijing to claim the moral high ground on the issue after then-US President Donald Trump, who called climate change a \u201choax\u201d, withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s first moves after assuming office in January was to return the US to the Paris agreement.\n\n\u201cChina was the last man standing. If there\u2019s no public finance of coal from China, there\u2019s little to no global coal expansion,\u201d Justin Guay, the director of global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project, a group advocating for a global transition from coal and fossil fuels, said of Xi\u2019s promise.\n\nGuterres welcomed Xi\u2019s move on coal and Biden\u2019s pledge on helping developing nations deal with climate change.\n\n\u201cAccelerating the global phase out of coal is the single most important step to keep the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement within reach, he said in a statement.",
