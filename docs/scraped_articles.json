          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nMedical experts have said that hearing strange voices and seeing unusual things is a symptom of schizophrenia and not \u2018madness\u2019, as many Nigerians assume, noting that the medical condition affects a person\u2019s ability to think, feel and behave properly.\n\nThe experts also stated that a recent study suggested that about 1.86 million people suffer from schizophrenia in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts were reacting to recent reports that hardship and frustrations are fuelling schizophrenia and other mental health challenges in the country.\n\nAccording to the experts, a recent study by the World Health Organisation has confirmed that schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder affecting 20 million people worldwide.\n\nThe health condition, they said, is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions and language, as well as hallucinations and delusions.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the Director of Pharmacy and Head of Department, Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, Mrs. Olawunmi Peters, disclosed that a recent research has suggested that about 1.86 million people suffer from schizophrenia in Nigeria.\n\nShe explained that people with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment.\n\n\u201cThe person with this disorder hears and sees things in clear consciousness, which other people can\u2019t hear or see. In some cases patients may exhibit a deficit of functions such as lack of motivation, reduced speech, social withdrawal, or bluntness of effect,\u201d Peters said.\n\nShe recalled a particular patient who strongly believed that her first son used a hammer to drive nails into her skull every day. She added that, even in the face of contrary evidence, the woman refused to believe otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe patient would often be seen laughing to herself for no reason, and at times becomes very angry, telling her friends that her family wanted her dead. At some point, she became restless and suspicious and refused to eat for days.\n\n\u201cShe also described hearing voices abusing her and discussing her actions; and no matter how much you tried to talk her out of it, she was still experiencing these distressing symptoms,\u201d Peters said.\n\nThe director noted that a patient suffering from schizophrenia can only become violent when he or she is in the acute phase of the illness.\n\n\u201cAnd this usually happens when the condition remains untreated. Many patients who receive treatment are actually able to function well in society and build careers, especially when they are compliant with their medications and therapy sessions.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how disconcerting it can be when your live experience or reality is doubted by everyone around you and no matter how much you try to explain that you hear these voices, they insist that you are unwell?\n\n\u201cYet, you have no fever, no headache, no body pain, or any other measurable signs. This is the reality of so many schizophrenic patients and we can\u2019t blame them for their condition because they did not choose to have schizophrenia,\u201d she said.\n\nPeters added that, with adequate interventions from the clinical psychiatrists, pharmacists, nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers, individuals with schizophrenia can live a normal life.\n\nA consultant clinical pharmacist and National Chairman, Association of Hospital and Administrative Pharmacists of Nigeria, Dr. Kingsley Amibor, disclosed that in a population of over 200 million, Nigeria accounts for 100,000 new cases of schizophrenia on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cIt is often triggered in late adolescent age, around 19 to 20 years. Some may not be detected till they are in their early 30s, with symptoms like false belief (illusion), hallucination, while some have fixed mindsets. There is nothing you can tell them that they will believe.\n\n\u201cAlso, 48 percent of identical twins risk having schizophrenia. We are not saying all the children will have it but there is a risk that some will have it and environmental factors and viral infections play a role,\u201d Amibor said.\n\nHis view was corroborated by the Deputy Director in charge of Pharmacy at FNPH, Yaba, Dr. OyetunjiAjayi.\n\nAjayi disclosed that drug abuse or long-time substance use might trigger schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cThis condition can be treated or reversed. Schizophrenia is not a direct cause of death for anybody but the condition might get worse if they don\u2019t get the required treatment or medication.\n\n\u201cWhere I work, we have over 50,000 new cases annually. In the times of COVID-19, we had an average of 10-15 new cases daily and this is because it is people that know that the condition is treatable that come for treatment,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "People with disability protest insecurity, sues for peace in South-East",
          "text": "By Ugochukwu Alaribe, Umuahia\n\nPeople with disabilities under the aegis of the Joint National Association of Persons with Disability, JONAPWD, South-East zone, has decried the high state of insecurity in the South East and sued for peace in the zone.\n\nThe Association who stated this during a visit to the Methodist Bishop and Co-Chair of the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace, IDFP, Dr. Sunday Onuoha, in Umuahia, Abia State, stated that banditry, kidnapping, and other violent crimes have become the order of the day and urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation and sue for peace and dialogue.\n\nCoordinator of JONAPWD, South East zone, Hon. Wisdom Okechukwu Kalu, lamented that persons with disability are the most vulnerable and worst hit in the situation, stressing that they visited Bishop Onuoha for him to help amplify their cries to the government and well meaning individuals.\n\nALSO READ: Former President Jonathan, others to attend launch of book on entrepreneurship in Abuja\n\nIn his words; \u201cWe sue for peace because of what is happening in the country. Insecurity, killings by bandits are all over the place. We, the persons with disabilities, are the most vulnerable and the worst hit in the situation. That when people with legs, vision, and able-bodied will be running and escaping for their dear lives, persons with disabilities cannot help themselves. Therefore, we are trapped between life and death.\n\nThis is why we have come from all the states of the South East to visit Bishop Sunday Onuoha because we know his voice carries influence and weight. We are calling on him for safety, for him to call on all the leaders from all walks of life, to call them for peace that the persons with disability in Nigeria are suffering and are now trapped by insecurity. That we are the most vulnerable, we don\u2019t want to die. We are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation and call for peace and dialogue.\n\nThat we, the persons with disability, should suffer only one thing. We can\u2019t suffer from a disability and still be facing death daily in Nigeria. The insecurity is alarming; we are using this opportunity to call the UN, EU, USA, and the international community to call for our rescue in Nigeria. That we are crying and dying of hunger, hardship and insecurity, and suffering disability. The trouble is too much on us. We are calling on Bishop Onuoha to help amplify our voice so that the nation can hear us.\u201d\n\nWhile welcoming the members of the group, Bishop Onuoha, condemned the destruction of lives and property and urged those being manipulated to cause such destruction to desist.\n\nHe tasked the security agencies to be careful in the discharge of their duties in order not to waste innocent lives, stressing that the nation can resolve its differences without bloodshed.\n\n\u201cWe all need peace. And where there is crisis, nobody is secured and where there is peace and harmony, there can be guarantee that each person\u2019s rights will be respected. A gunshot doesn\u2019t know whether you are a Bishop or Imam, it doesn\u2019t know whether you are blind or crippled. The gun does not know whether you have legs or not. Whenever it is shot, it goes out.\n\nALSO READ: Minister demands justice for allegedly raped, murdered UniIlorin student\n\n\u201cThe concern we have at this point is that lives are being destroyed, we do not support criminality and burning of public places. We also do not support innocent Nigerians being killed in the name of insecurity. Many young people are being wasted, many people are missing. A story goes that a blind man was almost killed by security agents In Owerri. We don\u2019t want such to continue, it is time for everybody to come to the table. We can all come to the table; nobody should be too small or big to say I am sorry.\n\n\u201cWe are one family under God; we can resolve whatever differences we have without bloodshed. None of us gave life and none of us has the right to take life; life belongs to the Almighty God. We need to appeal to our security agencies; they have to be careful in carrying out their legitimate responsibilities. They must not destroy innocent lives. Lives are precious, we shouldn\u2019t waste them. Let\u2019s respect the rights of others.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that the President has asked law enforcement agencies to go and destroy innocent lives. They are directed to protect lives and when those lives that are supposed to be protected are destroyed; then there will be crisis. We don\u2019t want crisis and war. We also want to appeal to young people who are being used and manipulated to destroy public properties to stop. We can\u2019t continue like this destroying public properties and our common wealth.\n\nIt is unacceptable. Life is difficult; we should sustain what we have so that we can give employment to the people. If we destroy our common assets, there will be unemployment.

          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged the Federal Government, FG, to have a rethink over the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria by embarking on dialogue with the aim of resolving the issues.\n\nRecall that FG had last Friday, announced indefinite suspension on the operations of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria. This was announced by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, according to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Segun Adeyemi.\n\nConsequently, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, directed the Director of Public Prosecution to begin immediate prosecution of those who violate the Federal Government\u2019s order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s businesses, reportedly lost over N4.3 billion in days after suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nALSO READ: TB Joshua: Wound of his passage\u2019ll take time to heal \u2014 Family\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, Sanwo-Olu, while appearing on an early morning Television Show in Lagos, by panelists, led by Dr, Rueben Abati, speaking on the second anniversary of his administration as well as achievements and State of the Nation, made the passionate appeal to the FG.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu: \u201cThough, I will not want to join issues concerning the Twitter ban. Last week I was on a factfinding tour to some of our technology hubs to encourage our players where we pledged to support them. We have research grants to support the sector which are in N20 million, N10 million, N5 million, and we did over N250 million last year. In terms of interventions, we are supporting them. We are building biggest Iniformation Communication Technology, ICT, hub in Nigeria to be sited in Lagos.\n\n\u201cOn the Twitter ban, I can\u2019t sit here with all the responsibilities that I have and flay the Commander In Chief of the Armed Forces, who is having all the prognosis of the security I don\u2019t have, I can\u2019t begin to say what he has done is right or wrong.\n\n\u201cAlbeit, on both sides there are issues that can be resolved by the Twitter and our government. The action is not a ban but a suspension as they said. In view of this let us all sit down and a have a conversation.\n\nALSO READ: Former President Jonathan, others to attend launch of book on entrepreneurship in Abuja\n\n\u201c If Twitter had to take his investment to a country with 5 million subscribers and not Nigeria with 40 million subscribers, this speaks to the reason why we also need to have that conversation. In other climes they sign underlining agreement before operations on the rules of engagement, I\u2019m not sure if we have that here.\n\n\u201c Having said that, FG can handle this a lot better. A lot of e-commerce, a lot youths doing digital stuff on the internet, we can not throw all these away and pretend nothing is happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraints and better management from both sides.\n\n\u201cAnd what I\u2019m pleading is within the next two days let\u2019s see that happen, let us come together and resolve it amicably, Lagos is hurting, our youths are hurting, Nigeria is hurting and let us understand that what are the issues in getting this behind us so that we don\u2019t politicize it, people are losing monies, businesses, and economies are being destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere is also the security issues, let us be circumspect, don\u2019t let us throw the baby with the bath water. And I\u2019m ready to speak to it if I\u2019m called upon to give quality advice on what I feel should be done.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Worried by the worsening gridlock on the access roads leading to the country\u2019s two busiest ports in Apapa, the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has met with the Lagos State Government to map out strategies to tackle the menace.\n\nA statement by Olaseni Alakija, NPA General Manager, Strategic and Corporate Communications, indicated that NPA\u2019s Acting Managing Director, Mr Muhammed Bello-Koko, at the meeting with Gov Babajide Sanwo-Olu, emphasised the need for measures to curb corrupt practices and alleged extortion of truck drivers by traffic and security operatives along the Lagos Ports corridor.\n\nThe statement quoted Bello-Koko as harping on the need to strengthen enforcement of traffic laws along the Apapa and Tin Can Ports roads.\n\nBello-Koko told the governor that NPA was being inundated with complaints of extortions, especially by security operatives, and described the menace as a hindrance to the smooth implementation of the truck call-up system.\n\nBello-Koko lamented that no less than 30 \u201ctoll-points\u201d had sprung up around the Apapa and Tin Can Port, where bribes were allegedly being collected before trucks were allowed into the Port.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the meeting, Bello-Koko said that it focused on alleged extortion by security operatives, adding that NPA solicited government\u2019s intervention to check the menace.\n\n\u201cAt the NPA, we resolved to take the right punitive measures against any of our staff involved in this; we have moved some of them out of Port locations. We will do further reviews, whoever is found involved, will be appropriately sanctioned.\n\n\u201cBecause of the involvement of several security units, many checkpoints have been created; we believe there are over 30 checkpoints within the Apapa and Tin Can Port axis.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is a major issue causing delays and a whole lot of problems, so this was one of the concerns we raised at the meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NPA boss acknowledged that the Lagos State Government had been a close partner, especially in enforcement, both in terms of providing security operatives and monitoring of the \u201cEto\u201d call-up system, but emphasised the need to strengthen that collaboration.\n\nHe said he had directed the \u201cEto\u201d Project Consultant and operator of the Lilipond Truck Transit Park to redouble their efforts, especially on the deployment of necessary physical and IT infrastructure as well as adequate human resources, to address the gaps and complaints of delay from Port users.\n\nHe disclosed that NPA had given the TTP company \u201cmarching orders\u201d to immediately see to the deployment of the infrastructure, so as to reduce the waiting time of trucks in and out of the Port.\n\nBello-Koko further said that the meeting discussed the matter of poor access roads, especially around Sunrise Bus-stop leading to the Tin Can Port.\n\n\u201cTrucks going to Tin Can now use the Apapa Port road, so no matter how much you control the traffic in Apapa, it will not be noticed.\n\n\u201cNPA has reached out to the Federal Ministry of Works; we have been speaking with the Director of Works in the State, and we have asked that they should provide some palliatives around Sunrise Bus-stop.\n\n\u201cWe were made to understand that the contract for that section of the road has just been awarded, but because of the rains, work has been delayed. There is need for that part of the road to be graded so that the Tin-Can Port corridor will begin to enjoy some measure of free flow of traffic.\n\n\u201cWe have stakeholders like Dangote and others who have factories within the Port and each of them may need to bring in about 300 trucks daily, but it has to be done in such a way that their operations do not affect the need of other Port users.\n\n\u201cThe governor has promised to further engage the Commissioner of Police in Lagos; he has also directed LASTMA to keep the Port roads free of congestion,\u201d he said.\n\nBello-Koko expressed optimism that the renewed collaboration with the Lagos State Government would bring an end to the perennial gridlock within and around the Apapa metropolis, adding that trucks not registered would not have access to the Port.\n\n\u201cWe want residents of Apapa to be able to commute daily without stress; we need to also ensure that containers go into the Port and come out smoothly. We believe that with this meeting, solutions have been found. NPA will play its part and the Lagos government will play its part,\u201d he said.\n\nBello-Koko further said that efforts were in place toward improving the transfer and processing of exports at the Port.\n\n\u201cNPA is collaborating with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) to establish a seamless integration of the export processing terminals into the \u2018Eto\u2019 platform. This is in addition to the Lilypond Export Terminal expected to take off soon, which will serve as a dedicated export loading point.\n\n\u201cThe move will reduce travel time along the port corridor, safeguard the quality of the country\u2019s exports and impact positively on government\u2019s revenue from non-oil exports,\u201d the NPA boss.\n\nThe statement also quoted Sanwo-Olu as saying that the Lagos State government would work closely with the NPA toward the success of the truck call-up system, while calling on all port users to be alert to their responsibilities toward ending the gridlock in Apapa.\n\nHe emphasised the need for Port service providers, security agencies and NPA to adhere to their Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and also invest in the needed infrastructure which would galvanise the \u201cEto\u201d system to heightened performance.\n\nThe governor said that the State Government would commence engagements with the petroleum tanker drivers, tank farm owners and the NUPENG Union, to ensure that they were factored into the \u201cEto\u201d call-up system.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, the poor state of the Sunrise Bus-stop corridor has been identified as the major cause of the traffic congestion into the Tin Can Island Port, and there is need for the contractors to speed up work around that area.\n\nOn his part, Mr Jide Oduyoye, General Manager of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), said that Port users should expect a renewed vigour from LASTMA in dealing with the traffic situation around the Lagos Ports.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

I should have known better when it arrived , served by a lady who seemed unsure of herself and literarily shivering , again this should have warned me.\n\n\u201cAfter dropping the water off a glass cup on top of a very thick side table, she was summoned immediately but not before she gave me a very cold look filled with fear and danger alarms ringing, stupid me did not take note.\n\n\u201cI gulped down the water in one fell swoop and requested to see my co actors and the crew , at this time I was frighteningly alone until yet another steward , this time a much more assured looking male steward sundered in , picked up the remote control of a very wide tv set with similar dimensions of a vertically placed ping pong board, he turned it on and requested if I wanted to watch a Nollywood movie or a foreign one. I answered in the latter and allowed myself to be enveloped in the comfortably well made leather settee I had settled in.\n\n\u201cI requested for the bathroom as he was about to leave and also enquired about the other crew members and my co actors, he mumbled \u201cthey\u2019ll see you shortly, and the right door to your left\u201d to both my questions.\n\n\u201cI could have sworn I staggered to get up from my enveloping settee to navigate the bathroom as he described, feeling like I was staggering , I made for the white door with a male miniature emoji indicating boys room on the door.\n\n\u201cThe bathroom had a 2\u2032 x 2\u2032 window installed and as I struggled with my quasi consciousness to unzip my fly, I could have sworn I heard voices speaking in hush tones deciding how much to make off my body parts.\n\n\u201cAfter I was done and flushed, which I later realised to be a mistake, I observed the hush toned voices had subsided and foot steps had taken over hurriedly leaving the bathroom window I had just used\u2026\n\n\u201cI managed to send an SOS message to my friend fearing the worst and his urgent arrival to my rescue with a last minute message not to come alone.\n\n\u201cAfter I confirmed he had received the message and confirmation of his quick \u201cCopy that, stay calm and do not give away your fears feedback\u201d I quickly pocketed my phone, opened the door and fell straight into the arms of four heavily built men who started manhandling me and asking what I had heard, a quick upper court to my jugular by one of the men after series of migraine inducing slaps and punches and I passed out.\n\n\u201cI came to at the Air Force Medical Facility by Rumukrushi Road and my friend was there to assure me all was well. I had narrowly escaped a case of ritualists and cultists who were rampant in that side of PH.\n\n\u201cMy friend told me I was lucky and my updates had made things easy for him and his men as well as the IGP anti- kidnapping Team who worked together to have me and about 20 other victims rescued.\n\n\u201cSadly two other victims were not that lucky as they had been dismembered, butchered and their parts packed for human organ traders, dealers and merchants.\u201d",

          "text": "Security agents yesterday foiled an attempt to attack the Imo State Police Command headquarters.\n\nThey killed six of the assailants.\n\nOne of them, Joseph Uka Nnachi alias Dragon, was said to be the squad commander of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nThe police said he was responsible for over 70 per cent of the killings in the Southeast.\n\nOn April 5, gunmen attacked the command headquarters with explosives, destroying several vehicles and freeing over 600 detainees.\n\nIts spokesman, Bala Elkana, said Dragon and his gang were neutralised before they could access the headquarters.\n\n\u201cThey made effort to access the police headquarters through Works Layout around Avan Nursery and Primary School but were vehemently repelled.\n\n\u201cThey came in a white Hummer bus. Five of the hoodlums were killed during an exchange of fire and others were injured. The Hummer bus is recovered.\n\n\u201cFour Ak47 rifles all belonging to police officers they killed in two police stations, six bombs, 2,000 rounds of AK47 ammunition, seven AK47 magazines and two operational buses, one loaded with explosive were recovered.\n\n\u201cThe joint teams of the police and Army gallantly fought and neutralised the IPOB/ESN terrorists after several minutes of fierce gun battle along Works Road, near the Police Headquarters.\n\n\u201cAll the charms the notorious killer Joseph Uka Nnachi aka Dragon, native of Ebonyi State and his group were using which they so much believed in have failed them once more,\u201d said the police.\n\nThe spokesman told our correspondent that one of the gang members was captured alive and \u201chas made a useful statement\u201d.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma said the government was doing everything to ensure that peace returned to Imo.\n\nHe spoke while addressing worshippers at the Government House Chapel, Owerri, after service.\n\n\u201cToday (yesterday), the security architecture of government yielded another huge success as the combined efforts of security agencies in the state repelled another attempt on the police headquarters in Owerri.\n\n\u201cIt was an attempt by the bandits to release some criminals in police custody, particularly most of those that have confessed to having committed the crimes for which they were arrested and detained,\u201d the governor said.\n\nCommissioner\u2019s houses razed in Imo\n\nAlso yesterday, arsonists razed two houses belonging to Imo Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Chief Declan Emelumba.\n\nThe incident occurred in his hometown Ubulu-Ihejiofor in Oru West Local Government Area at about 1 am.\n\nSources said gunshots were heard as villagers ran into the bush.\n\nThe assailants were said to have broken down the gate and set the houses ablaze.\n\nEmelumba told our correspondent that the hoodlums stormed his houses heavily armed.\n\n\u201cBetween 1 am and 2 am, some people called me from the village that heavily-armed gunmen stormed my compound, broke the gate and set the buildings ablaze.\n\n\u201cMy gateman, who was the only person around when the gunmen came, managed to escape unhurt but the bandits had easy access to the buildings and completely burnt down everything,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nPolice station razed in Delta\n\nGunmen yesterday morning attacked a police station in Ashaka community in Ndokwa East Local Government Area in Delta State with explosives.\n\nThe assailants set the station on fire and torched its operational vehicle donated by the community and the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC).\n\nPolice spokesman Bright Edafe said the gunmen, numbering about 20, threw improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at the station.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that no life was lost and no arm was taken away. However, the police will not relent in ensuring that law and order are maintained in any community,\u201d he said.\n\nOperatives of the command shot dead six suspected kidnappers during a raid of their hideouts in the state.\n\nThe command recovered one AK47 rifle, one pump action gun and one AK47 magazine with 25 live ammunition.\n\nThe police said four suspects were arrested along the Bayelsa-Patani section of the East-West Road. Tactical operatives recovered a locally made Barretta pistol from the suspects.\n\nOne killed, others abducted in Anambra\n\nSecurity agencies allegedly stormed the home of Ifeanyi Ejiofor in Oraifite, Ekwusigo Local Government Area.\n\nEjiofor is IPOB\u2019s lawyer.\n\nSources said the team of operatives included soldiers, operatives of the Department of Security Services (DSS) and policemen.\n\nOne of the Hilux vehicles that conveyed the operatives was set ablaze during the ensuing commotion, but it could not be immediately confirmed who lit the fire.\n\nIt was learnt that Ejiofor\u2019s elder brother, driver and two others were abducted.\n\nEjiofor had earlier raised alarm on social media about the presence of security agents in his home.\n\nIt was leant that his assistant died in the commotion as gunshots rang out.\n\nA source said: \u201cWe managed to Barr Ifeanyi Ejiofor on phone and he confirmed the attack, saying that soldiers, joined by Police and DSS operatives shot in different directions and were about to break into his main compound.\u201d\n\nThe source said there were distressed voices of villagers and neighbours panicking and crying.\n\nPolice spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu, could not confirm the incident.\n\nBut a Senior Police Officer, who spoke with our correspondent in confidence, confirmed the incident, saying one person died and one Hilux van burnt.\n\nHe said normalcy had been restored, adding that security agents had taken over the area.\n\nIPOB spokesman Emma Powerful said in a statement: \u201cIt was around 2.30 am that they surrounded his (Ejiofor\u2019s) country home. Is it an offence for someone to defend IPOB?\n\n\u201cEjiofor is doing his job as a lawyer. Where in the world would a legal practitioner be harassed because he represents an organisation?\u201d\n\nPowerful alleged that security agents invaded Ejiofor\u2019s home on December 2, 2019, and killed over 10 people.\n\n\u201cSince then, they are still trailing and harassing him. The whole world must hear this,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nThere appears to be more trouble coming the way of the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN) Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, as he has been summoned to Abuja for interrogation by operatives of the Department of State Services.\n\nThe operatives who arrived at the ground on Sunday to deliver the letter of invitation did not meet the fiery priest at the church premises. It was also learnt that security guards at the premises refused to accept the letter requesting that the operatives should return on Monday to deliver it to the priest in person.\n\nJust last week, Mbaka returned from a 30-day compulsory prayer retreat imposed on him by the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga over his recent prophesies.\n\nThis was followed by a letter from the Bishop which stripped Mbaka of total control of the adoration ministry as it was converted to a Chaplaincy. Though Mbaka remained the Chaplain in charge, the Bishop reserved the right to appoint a new Chaplain or his assistants under the new arrangement. Onaga also announced that political statements and prophesies had been banned at the adoration ground.\n\nMbaka\u2019s troubles started recently when he prophesied against the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The cleric had said that God had rejected the President over his inability to provide jobs for youths noting that it was reason for widespread insecurity in the nation.\n\nHe went further to urge the President to resign or be impeached by the national assembly.\n\nReacting to the latest development in his Sunday message, Mbaka queried the rationale behind his invitation, insisting that as a prophet, he will not be cowed into silence. He warned that anyone who was contemplating closing down the ministry would regret such move.\n\n\u201cI got a call on Thursday that the DSS people from Abuja came here (Enugu) with a letter of invitation to Abuja. Over what? What I cannot understand is that the mother church in Nigeria should be \u201ccowed down\u201d to lilliputian.\n\n\u201cThe mother church is both a lamb and lion. The bible says if the foundation is destroyed, what can the just man do.\n\n\u201cAll these are efforts to dumbfound a prophet. All priest can be dumbfounded but no prophet should. We must protect the sheep. In this time, when killings are all over, when there is hunger everywhere, people do not have hope again. The only hope I have is God. Anybody who will stop people from worshipping here will regret it.\n\n\u201cI am the servant here. They don\u2019t understand history. I spoke against Abacha. I went to Minna to tell Babangida what was wrong in his time. I spoke to Obasanjo face to face. I perform under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. I ministered to the late President Yar\u2019adua. I am being used by a supernatural spirit called the Holy Spirit.\n\n\u201cIf they are attacking me here and there, even from those that should save me, no wahala (no problem). The Bible says if God is for us, who can be against us? Only God can be God. I heard the security people did not accept the letter. They asked them to come on Monday to give me the letter. If they know the anointing here is too hot for them, let them change. I will not keep quiet.\n\n\u201cLook at the millions of youths moving about unemployed and you call us Father. Should a father be comfortable in a situation like this? What kind of father is that?\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBlood flowed freely in Igangan, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapaland in Oyo State, on Saturday night, as gunmen dispatched over 45 persons to their early graves in the town.\n\nBesides, the five-hour invasion also led to burning of more than 60 houses, while over 160 vehicles were also destroyed, apart from a petrol filling station and the palace of Ashigangan of Igangan, Oba Lasisi Adeoye, that were also razed.\n\nIt was in the same Igangan that angry youths razed the village and vehicles of the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salihu, in February, this year, after the popular Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, held a town hall meeting in the town. Salihu was evicted from the town based on allegations of aiding and abeitting killings, kidnapping and destruction of farmland in the area.\n\nImpeccable sources said the invaders stormed Igangan at about 11pm, on Saturday, and operated till 4am, yesterday, before leaving the town in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe bandits, according to sources, were about 50 and they invaded the town on more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nCommunity leaders speak on bloodbath\n\nThe Secretary of Farmers Union in Igangan, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said many lives were lost during the invasion, adding that the invaders shot many residents dead, while security agents also neutralised some of the attackers.\n\nThe convener of Igangan Development Advocate, Oladiran Oladokun, said: \u201cOn numerous occasions, Ibrahim, Seriki Saliu\u2019s son kept threatening that Igangan would be razed down to ashes. He had the audacity to proclaim this on social media as well as on radio shows; perhaps, his words were taken as mere groans, but local vigilantes at Igangan kept receiving the news of impending danger.\n\n\u201cThe state, I believe, thought it\u2019s just another hype, for we notified the state of our fears on the 14th of April, when covert information reached us of a meeting of the Fulani, towards fulfilling their oath of allegiance towards reprisals.\n\n\u201cIf we had not made a little cover, perhaps, as Ibarahim, son of Seriki threatened, Igangan would have become a dunghill of ashes; or, perhaps, this is just their beginning.\u201d\n\nA former caretaker chairman of Ibarapa North, where Igangan is located, Tunji Omolewu, stated: \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town.

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigeria appears to be at crossroads over the steady rise in oil prices which hit $72 per barrel over the weekend, distorting earlier projections of the World Bank and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which had earlier predicted a low price regime for 2021.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil price benchmark is gradually making a rebound with a barrel of oil likely to hit $75 in the weeks ahead and probably above, a development that signaled a ray of hope for the troubled sector which has battled a low price regime occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic since last year.\n\nIronically, while other oil producing countries with robust refining capacity are anxious to reap the gains of higher oil prices, Nigeria seems to be fretting because a higher price regime will definitely translate to increased cost of refining and higher fuel subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, gains will be reaped for the country as its 2021 oil price projection was based on an estimate of $40 per barrel, indicating a daily gain of $57.6 daily for the country at 1.8 million barrels of oil production per day.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, had warned that states might have nothing to share from the FAAC because the country spends about N112 billion monthly subsidizing fuel as a result of the inefficient state of the nation\u2019s refineries which currently is in comatose.\n\nThere was anxiety and panic in the country in April when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had, in a letter to the Accountant General of the Federation , projected that it would deduct N112 billion oil and gas proceeds from the Federation Account for fuel subsidy in order to ensure continuous supply of petroleum products in the country and guarantee energy security\n\nWith daily consumption of petrol at 55 million litres per day and oil at $72 per barrel, the N112 billion monthly subsidy claims may balloon to over N200 billion monthly.\n\nSpeaking in April at the fifth edition of the special ministerial briefings coordinated by the presidential communications team, Kyari said while the actual cost of importation and handling charges of petrol amounted to N234 per litre, the government was selling the product at N162 per litre. That development, according to him, cost the country about N120billion monthly.\n\nWhile pump price steadily rose, the face-off between labour and Federal Government kept the latter in a tight corner. The unions had earlier forced the government to reverse the pump price from N168 per litre last year to N162.",

          "text": "Condolence messages have been pouring in following the demise of Prophet TB Joshua.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he would be missed by his followers all over the world not only for his spiritual contributions, but for touching many lives through philanthropic gestures.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, Buhari who commiserated with the family and members of SCOAN on the passing of their father and founder, urged them to take solace in the knowledge that life is not measured and defined by chronological longevity, but by enduring legacies and lives touched positively.\n\nThis is as Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said he received the news of the death with a heavy heart.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, in a statement by his media aide, Richard Olatunde, said the renowned cleric was a blessing to humanity and a great Ambassador of the state whose ministry was noted for charity.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Prophet Joshua\u2019s demise came as a rude shock. The pains are not mere emotional flashes; they are indeed piercing. The Ondo State born Pastor and Televangelist was a philanthropist whose exit will be sorely missed by many.\n\n\u201cProphet Joshua was committed to giving and was more often, inexorably imbued with calmness while lifting the downtrodden. As a televangelist, he did not just win souls for Christ, he was passionate about changing lives.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated timelessly, an alluring service to humanity and compassion by assisting not only his home local government, Akoko North West. Other adjoining local governments in Akoko land benefitted from his large heart of benevolence.\u201d\n\nKogi Governor, Yahaya Bello, said the cleric would be missed for his audacious truth telling and his peaceful advocacies as well as great concern for humanity most especially, widows, orphan and people living with disabilities\n\nWhile he prayed for God to comfort and strengthen the family, church and those greatly hurt by his death, he urged them not to derail for the footprints of the late clergy mostly his humanitarian endeavours\n\nIn his reaction, Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, said he was saddened by the pastor\u2019s death, who he said impacted the lives of millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cPastor Joshua deployed his gift of delivering the word of God in relatable terms to advance the church of Christ and brought laughter, solace and comfort to many with Christ\u2019s message of love.\u201d\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, in a statement, said the evangelist will be remembered not only for spreading the gospel of Christ, but also for his humanitarian works through which he positively touched millions of lives.\n\nHis death shocking, painful \u2013 Kalu\n\nLamenting the demise of the renowned preacher and evangelist, former Abia governor and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu said Pastor Joshua was popular beyond the shores of Nigeria, adding that he would be greatly missed by his followers.\n\nIn his condolence message, Kalu prayed for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cHis death is shocking and painful. He was committed to spreading the gospel of God through his religious and philanthropic platforms. Pastor Joshua was simple, kind-hearted, generous and easy going.\n\n\u201cHe played a key role in human capital development through philanthropy and counselling. His demise has no doubt, left a big vacuum in the Synagogue.\n\n\u201cHowever, the congregation should take solace in the fact that the late clergyman contributed immensely to the growth of the Synagogue church and the larger community by touching lives positively.\n\n\u201cThe late Pastor Joshua will be remembered as a notable spiritual leader with passion for empowering the poor and vulnerable in the society.\u201d\n\nWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased, Kalu extended his condolences to the people and government of Ondo state over the sad loss.\n\nJonathan, Arthur Eze, Gani Adams mourn\n\nFormer president, Goodluck Jonathan, described the late Joshua as a devout man of God, who served God and humanity with relentless passion during his life.\n\nThe former president in a message by Ikechukwu Eze, in Abuja, yesterday, said he impacted millions of lives across Nigeria and the globe.\n\nHe said he was saddened to hear about the death of T.B Joshua, at a young age of 57.\n\n\u201cTB Joshua was a devout man of God who served God and humanity with relentless passion.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of sound doctrine, meek and faithful to his call and passion of reconciling men to God and offering hope to humanity.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian leader, TB Joshua and his ministry exemplified Christ in faith, love and charity; positively impacting the lives of many Nigerians, Africans and millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cI condole with his family, his church and millions of his followers across the world. May God grant them peace and strength to cope with this loss,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nThe former president also prayed God to grant millions of Joshua\u2019s followers across the world the strength to cope with his exit.\n\nAcclaimed philanthropist and oil merchant, Prince Arthur Eze, described his death as a global calamity for the entire human race and Christians worldwide.\n\nAccording to Prince Eze, with TB Joshua\u2019s death, Nigeria has lost a precious citizen who stood out as a symbol of national unity and pride.\n\nHe said the death was a big loss to the preaching and spreading of the gospel and entire Christendom world wide.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze said the prophet would be missed by his teeming admirers and followers to whom he dedicated his spiritual powers, healing and delivering them from evil spirits and divers health challenges.\n\nProphet Joshua he said was used to perform a lot of notable healings which immortalised him.\n\nThe philanthropiat described TB Joshua as a humble man of God who the Almighty used to touch many souls in terms of philanthropy and spiritual cleansing.\n\n\u201cIndeed TB Joshua was a religious iroko tree whose life gave succour and salvation to humanity\u201d he lamented.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze prayed for the repose of the soul of Prophet TB Joshua while believing that \u201che is already seated in the right hand of our lord jesus christ.\u201d\n\nPrince Eze however expressed regrets that those whom he was used to cure and were still being healed from different ailments and health problems would miss his ministrations for spiritual freedom and purity.\n\nThe Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has described the death as a rude shock, painful and devastating.\n\nAdams described the late prophet as an \u2018Iroko\u2019 tree and an abode for many.\n\n\u201cT.B. Joshua found favour in spreading the Gospel of God through his ministry.\n\n\u201cAccording to the words of God in the Bible, the Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult for me to come to terms with the reality of his death. It was very sad. Prophet T.B. Joshua lived and died for God. His life was a complete definition of God\u2019s generousity and philosophy.\u201d\n\nTerrible loss to Yoruba nation \u2013 Akintoye\n\nIlana Omo Oodua (IOO) said his demise was a loss to the Yoruba nation.\n\nLeader of the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, in a statement by Maxwell Adeleye, said he was a great servant of God with outreaches touching most part of the world and bringing charity to the needy everywhere, including his people in the Akoko Area of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIn many countries across the world, people watched his ministry on TV as he brought his gospel message with hope and joy. We, his people, will miss him greatly. We all pray that God will accept him into the joy of heaven,\u201d the renowned historian and Second Republic member of the Nigerian Senate said.\n\nIkotun community youths mourn\n\nThe youths in the community were also seen gathered in twos and threes speaking in hushed tones. They wondered what would become of their fate now that the man who brought rapid development to the area was no more.",

By October, Nigerians organized #EndSARS by using Twitter to raise awareness and pool resources. At the time, Nigeria\u2019s president complained of \u201cthe spreading of deliberate falsehood and misinformation through the social media in particular.\u201d\n\nEight months later, Twitter deletes the president\u2019s tweet for threatening violence. The government combines this with grievances about Twitter\u2019s indirect role in empowering #EndSARS, ordering internet service providers to ban Twitter indefinitely.\n\nA pyramid of distress\n\nNigerians still tweet (thanks VPNs). On a Saturday morning Twitter Space, someone said he was still able to run an ad campaign.\n\nIn fact, the ban is a suppression of government criticism, accountability and dissent. These things are not supposed to happen in a democracy, much less a country that wants to grow a digital economy.\n\n[ Read: Twitter ban rewinds Nigeria to pre-internet darkness and reign of fear ]\n\nBut it\u2019s happening and curious plans are in store for internet-enabled platforms in general \u2013 WhatsApp, YouTube and maybe even Netflix. But from the Twitter ban alone, at least three concerns are playing out:\n\nStifling social services: Twitter is a mainstream SOS platform in Nigeria. The Police relies on it, as does the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control which has gained over 1 million followers since COVID-19 broke out last year (they have tweeted after the ban). With Nigeria\u2019s crippled healthcare and education, social media lends traction to the many GoFundMe\u2019s standing between salvation and death.\n\n[ Read: Federal Ministry of GoFundMe ]\n\nCommercial constraints: Developers who use Twitter APIs are mad at this ban. Digital marketers who rely on brands for marketing gigs are feeling blue, as are startups who leverage Twitter to run lean customer service and dispute resolution. Those startups\u2019 investors are already asking questions about security.\n\nBut the most painful distress is increased Despair and Loss of faith.\n\nIn search of predictability and peace of mind, more talent could trade Nigeria for Canada and Europe. For those who remain, arbitrary militaristic bans increase anxiety and tendency for hopelessness.\n\nA people without hope, without a reliable expectation of the future, can hardly build a prosperous nation. That is Nigeria\u2019s challenge. Is this big picture obvious to the architects of this ban?",

Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Showmax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "text": "On behalf of the ownership of Farmsponsor Nig Ltd, we want to thank our sponsors for their unwavering support and trusting us as we work to improve the Agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nWe deeply share in your displeasure with the upset that the company has had in paying out its sponsors.\n\nThe past few days has been quite a challenge as the company has been facing some difficulties which has destabilized our crowd funding operations.\n\nThese challenge stems from the recent SEC cease announcement on all crowdfunding platforms by June 30, 2021. This has made it impractical for Farm-sponsor to continue its crowding operation as the notice came upon us abruptly, by the first week of June.\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures to see that all funds collected from every sponsor will be paid back accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn overview of Farmsponsor facilities and operational layout\n\nPlease bear with us as payments will likely be staggered. We are working to make payout as fast as possible but to be honest, it may take up to 18 \u2013 24 months to finish. Paying everyone at once will eat too deep into our operational cash flow. Let us continue to work to pay you.\n\nThe stated timeline is only but the very least. We are already working hard to see everyone is paid in the shortest of time, nevertheless we wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint twice so we have to settle for the stated projected timeframe.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that over the last two years, Farm-sponsor have accomplished a great deal, and we owe it to all your sponsorship.\n\nIn the time that we have been doing business together along with the funds you have trusted us with, we have been able to establish the following:\n\n\u2022 A 360,000-broiler Pen (biggest in South-South Nigeria).\n\n\u2022 60,000 capacity breeders pen (with over 10,000 laying breeder birds).\n\n\u2022 10 tons per hour feed mill.\n\n\u2022 24,000 per day fully automated chicken processing plant (recently installed and commissioned).\n\n\u2022 128,000 birds per week state of the art hatchery.\n\n\u2022 823 Hectares of land in Oyo State (valued above $3m).\n\n\u2022 A veterinary clinic and two retail supermarket outlets in the heart of Port Harcourt, amongst many other great features that we have achieved together.\n\nWe are just stating to make certain, perhaps you\u2019re in doubt that you have invested wisely.\n\nPart of our short term strategies is through overdraft or a term loan from some of our financial institutions. Our mid term strategy is through equity investment from institutional investors and we are willing to relinquish 30-50% of directors shares in the company. Our long term strategy would be direct revenue from the business, hence the 18-24 months.\n\nOur entire workforce is working tirelessly to ensure that we regain the trust you\u2019ve always had with Farmsponsor.\n\nIt\u2019s uneasy on our part that we are writing this letter instead of payment slips.\n\nWe apologize for any undue hardship or inconveniences that this might cause you.\n\nWe really appreciate your understanding, and support as well as believing in us as we walk this journey of emerging a stronger Farm-sponsor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAkpa Chike\n\nCo-founder, Globetrot Farmsponsor Nig Ltd.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "#Twitterban: Nigeria is borrowing a leaf from China\u2019s playbook",
          "text": "Recent events in Nigeria suggest the government could be aiming for deeper inspection of its cyberspace. While the Twitter ban points to this, a report by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) shows this might be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAccording to the report, government officials \u2014 Ibrahim Gambari, the Chief of Staff to the President, and Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture \u2014 reached out to the Cyberspace Administration of China to discuss plans to build an Internet firewall.\n\nFreedom of expression \u2014 specifically on the Internet \u2014 is an issue that has hovered over the Asian powerhouse for quite some time.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report 2019 specifically highlighted ways the Chinese authorities infringed on the human rights of its citizens. In July 2018, Hunan Police detained independent blogger, Chen Jieren, for writing articles accusing the provincial party of corruption. According to the report, he was termed an \u201cInternet pest\u201d polluting the online space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Sun Wenguang also had his right infringed upon when Chinese police broke into his home for doing a live interview with US broadcaster, Voice of America (VOA). Journalists from the same organisation who tried to interview the professor suffered the same fate.\n\nBefore the physical crackdown on Internet users, the Chinese authorities shut down parody and meme app, Neihan Duanzi, with over 38 million monthly users.\n\nMore recently, Amnesty International revealed the Internet censorship efforts by China to suppress information about the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the non-governmental organisation, Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to raise awareness about the virus in a chat group, was detained by local police for four days. Subsequently, he died of the virus.\n\nNigeria is following suit\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture tweeted that it would be suspending Twitter. The news came a few days after the microblogging platform deleted a tweet by Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s clampdown on social media did not start with the Twitter suspension. Like China, the country has been seeking ways to control social media.\n\nThe Frivolous Petition bill of 2015 signalled the government\u2019s intent to regulate the space. The bill sought to control online and print media as well as regulate social media.\n\nPer The Guardian, the bill was thrown out in 2016 but there was another effort to control online speech.\n\nIn 2019, the social media bill officially titled \u201cProtection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019\u2033 was introduced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the bill, individuals spreading false information or that which could affect the security and relationship of the country with other countries could face a \u20a6300,000 ($730) fine or jail time of up to three years.\n\nWhile the bill hasn\u2019t been passed into law, 117,780 people have signed a petition calling for the bill to be discarded. According to change.org, the petition was started by the Isale Eko Descendants\u2019 Union.\n\nThe Union says the bill aims to curb false information, but in reality, it contained provisions that could limit people\u2019s ability to criticise the government.\n\nComparing Nigeria and China\n\nThe Human Rights Watch also chronicled the physical assault of staff in a media company by the Chinese police. The company identified as Now TV reported the court hearing of a human rights lawyer.\n\nInterestingly, the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture has also directed the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms. A move that might as well censor content that criticises the government\n\nCurrently, extremities such as those in China haven\u2019t been recorded in Nigeria, but some citizens suggest that the country might as well be on its way.\n\nAccording to the Cable News Network (CNN), the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, has directed federal prosecutors to arrest and prosecute Twitter users.\n\nA Twitter user predicts that the situation could escalate from a ban to police searching phones and detaining those who have the app, a practise the supposedly defunct police unit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), is known for.\n\nTheir activities sparked the #EndSARS protest in 2020, as citizens, consisting mostly of youths, trooped out in numbers to denounce SARS.\n\nDuring the protest at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, some people witnessed disruptions to the Internet. Suspicions that the Internet was tampered with arose when MTN, the largest telecom provider in Nigeria, tweeted and deleted thereafter, an apology for the Internet disruptions.\n\nOnline magazine, ChinaFile, revealed the purposes of some equipment identified as an integrated surveillance system by Chinese authorities. WiFi sniffers, surveillance equipment, were said to be able to intercept unique information about an individuals phone such as International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)\n\nLikewise, the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy said in its Revised Policy for SIM Registration, that it will start taking IMEI of mobile phone users in Nigeria.\n\nThis sequence of policies by the Nigerian government bears an uncanny resemblance to that of China. Will it go just as far to maintain a hold on people\u2019s freedom of expression and the media?",
          "summary": "The Human Rights Watch report 2019 specifically highlighted ways the Chinese authorities infringed on the human rights of its citizens.\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s clampdown on social media did not start with the Twitter suspension.\nThe bill sought to control online and print media as well as regulate social media.\nIn 2019, the social media bill officially titled \u201cProtection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019\u2033 was introduced.\nInterestingly, the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture has also directed the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms.",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you <a href=\" \"> subscribe now </a>.\n\nGood day,\n\nOgheneruemu here.\n\nAs of Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria joined the increasing host of African nations with a history of a clampdown on the Internet or social media platforms.\n\nThe government, in an official statement by the Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed that it would be indefinitely banning the microblogging platform, Twitter, from operating in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes after the platform deleted a tweet by Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, referencing the Nigerian Civil War. The tweet had been the subject of public outcry, with many users reporting it for various reasons.\n\nThis is not the first time the government has attempted Internet censorship. You might remember the \u201csocial media bill\u201d, which was introduced in 2019 but was met with public objection because it was perceived to be a means to limit citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\n\nWhy the ban? While there was no official reason given in the first statement, on Saturday, June 5, 2021, the government released another statement.\n\nThis time, the platform\u2019s role in propagating misinformation and fake news was cited as the rationale behind the ban. Changing its previous stance, the ban was tagged temporary and no longer indefinite.\n\nLegally speaking, the ban has been described as contravening the human rights of Nigerian citizens as contained in the Constitution. The right to freedom of expression, which includes freedom to hold an opinion and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference, while not absolute, does not provide for abrogation in this manner.\n\nAdd to this, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has ordered the prosecution of anyone found using Twitter.\n\nI will be delving into this aspect of the conversation later today. Set a reminder to check it out on Techpoint Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019ve thought about the economic effects this might have, you should take a peek at this: 4 ways Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban could affect businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian Twitter users have taken to using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass the ban after telcos followed the government\u2019s directive and restricted access to the platform.\n\nCertainly, this tactic is now normal practise whenever any attempt is made at Internet censorship in Africa, but it may not be the safest approach.\n\nOur reporter, Victoria Fakiya, would be giving a much-needed analysis on this later today. Don\u2019t forget to watch out for this story.\n\nTo get a general idea of the reactions so far, hilarious and contemplative, check out, Nigerians react to FG suspension of Twitter.\n\nAlso, Nigerians on Twitter react to Nigeria\u2019s Twitter Suspension.\n\nBut it appears Nigerians might have a lot more to worry about soon.\n\nOn Sunday, June 6, 2021, the Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) reported that the government has reached out to China\u2019s Cyberspace regulator to build Nigeria\u2019s Internet firewall.\n\nIf this news is anything to go by, an Internet firewall similar to China\u2019s Great Firewall would not only prevent access to any platform of the government\u2019s choosing but also block the use of VPNs.\n\nRead: #TwitterBan: Nigeria reportedly meets China to control access to social media, VPNs, others\n\nSudden decision? Probably not. FIJ reports that discussions surrounding this decision have been on since the #EndSARS protests, which took place in 2020. Supposedly, the government has been desperate to control the Nigerian cyberspace following the role social media played in the protests.\n\nNigeria seems to be following in China\u2019s footsteps, from its decision to start collecting International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers to the Twitter ban, and now an Internet firewall.\n\nUndoubtedly interesting enough to warrant some scrutiny. Check out Bolu Abiodun\u2019s story on this later today.\n\nYou guessed right after all. The rhyming word is ban. Great minds\u2026\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nNigeria has lost 15.5 million subscribers following the SIM registration ban.\n\nNourishing dairy with tech, a path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth?

          "text": "Just two days after a ban on microblogging platform, Twitter, the Nigerian Federal Government is reportedly working to gain control over what Nigerians can access on the Internet.\n\nIf reports by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) are anything to go by, the Nigerian Presidency has reached out to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) to discuss plans to build an internet firewall.\n\nFij also reports that Ibrahim Gambari, the Chief of Staff to the President, and Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture were among those present in the meeting.\n\nThe Internet Firewall will be similar to China\u2019s Great Firewall, which allows the Chinese government to prevent access to social media platforms like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, and any other website it chooses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sophistication of China\u2019s Firewall also allows the government to block its citizens from using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nRecall that on June 4, 2021, the Nigerian government enforced a ban on Twitter, stating that the platform undermines the country\u2019s corporate existence. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) was also required to licence over-the-top (OTT) platforms like YouTube, Netflix, or other social media platform.\n\nThe Nigerian government has flirted with this move in the past. The Nigerian Communications Commission already has a framework to regulate OTT platforms, arguing that they negatively affect telco revenues.\n\nIn 2019, Nigerian lawmakers introduced two controversial and heavily criticised bills: The Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation and other Related Offences bill (Social Media Bill) and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech bill.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Finance Act 2020 also contains a legal provision to tax tech giants like Google and Facebook for the revenue they make from the country.\n\nHowever, we raised a major issue: a lack of the required technical expertise to implement regulations on or collect taxes from OTT platforms.\n\nIf the Nigerian Internet Firewall comes to fruition, Internet censorship of Nigerians, social media regulations, and taxation might become possible.\n\nInterestingly, China would also add Nigeria to a list of African countries where it has a significant but questionable presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s Huawei helped design the African Union (AU) Headquarters in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, but according to Le Monde reports (in French, use Chrome to translate), the US accused China of stealing data from the AU headquarters.\n\nHuawei was also accused of helping the Ugandan and Zambian governments spy on opposition parties.\n\nFigures from Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Office show that Nigeria\u2019s debt to China grew 136% between September 2015 and September 2020, from $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion.\n\nA significant part of that debt is a $328 million loan to install fibre optic cables in Northern Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, Nigeria\u2019s growing partnership with China could extend to much more than just building an Internet firewall.\n\nThis is a developing story.",

          "title": "Opportunity for micro-insurers as 18m Nigerians show interest",
          "text": "Some 18 million uninsured adult Nigerians have indicated interest in microinsurance products, according to the result from EFInA\u2019s 2020 survey on Access to Financial Services in Nigeria released on Thursday.\n\nThis opens a huge opportunity for insurers in the country who are struggling to grow their customer base.\n\nCurrently, nine out of 10 Nigerians do not have any insurance subscription. Top among reasons for this are lack of tailor-made insurance products and low disposable income on account of the sluggish economic growth that has remained fragile since 2015.\n\nThe unwillingness by many Nigerians to take up insurance products has kept the insurance penetration rate in Africa\u2019s largest economy at less than 1 percent in the last decade.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that most insurance products that we have currently do not address the needs that we have in Nigeria,\u201d said Ayokunle Olubunmi, head, Financial Institutions, Agusto & Co.\n\nAs the country is evolving, Olubunmi believes \u201cthere is a need\u201d for insurance companies \u201cto adjust products to meet demand\u201d.\n\nRead Also: How riot, insecurity insurance is becoming a big deal in Nigeria\n\nGoing by EFInA\u2019s data that put Nigeria\u2019s adult population at 106 million (18 years and above), 103 million are outside the insurance scheme as only 2 percent or 2 million adults were insured as of 2020.\n\n\u201cOnly 2 percent of Nigerian adults are insured, but 18 million uninsured adults say they would be interested in microinsurance,\u201d Ashley Immanuel, CEO of EFInA, said.\n\nInsurance as a percentage of the adult population that is covered by a regulated insurance policy in Nigeria has remained stagnant at 2 percent since 2016 when it moved from the 1 percent reported in 2014, as analyzed from the data by EFInA.\n\nOut of the 40 percent insurance inclusion target set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for 2020, only 2 percent was achieved as the target fell short by 38 percent.\n\nExplaining why many Nigerians don\u2019t consider an insurance cover as a priority, Jim Ovia, founder/chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, said in a statement that the major problem \u201cwe see in the Nigerian market is that per capita income of the people is very low and people tend not to take insurance as a priority against other things related to them\u201d.\n\nThat explains why the 18 million Nigerian adults who told EFInA of their interest to take up insurance said they wanted micro products.\n\nThe high cost of living in Nigeria which is not matched by the country\u2019s per capita income as the fragile economic growth has remained lower than the population growth rate since 2015 means that more Nigerians are becoming poorer, the reason why the country\u2019s \u2018sachet economy\u2019 has continued to expand.\n\nIncreasingly more Nigerians are only able to buy less of their usual consumption basket as a result of shrinking purchasing power.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at a record high of 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a population growth rate at an average of 3 percent per annum, Nigeria\u2019s 2021 first-quarter GDP growth by a paltry 0.51 percent is anything but undesirable.\n\nInflation rate which measures the rate at which the prices of goods and service increase in Nigeria eased to18.12 percent in April down slightly from a four year high of 18.17 percent in March.\n\nBefore Covid-19, about 80 million of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic and population growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023, says the World Bank.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 is easily blamed for the recent economic woes in Nigeria, an evaluation of the country\u2019s macro-economic indicators before the pandemic shows Nigeria was grappling with low growth before the pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps, including dollar shortages and inflation.\n\nEconomic growth in Africa\u2019s most populous nation averaged 1.2 percent between 2015 and 2020. The problem with that is the population grew two times faster at an average of 2.6 percent per year.\n\nDespite the low opportunity for many Nigerians to improve their income level, insurance, according to analysts is an important financial services product that should be in their consumption basket as it could help to mitigate losses, increase financial stability and promote trade and commerce activities that can result in sustainable economic growth and development.\n\nAccess to basic financial services like a savings account, credit and insurance means that a country is financially included. Nigeria recorded 64.1 percent financial inclusion rate in 2020, meaning 35.9 percent or 38.1 million adults, an increase from the 36.6 million in 2018 were excluded in 2020. A higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\nAccording to analysts, the challenge of insurance companies to deliver on the funds they will raise to meet the required capital base will birth innovative products that will consequently help to deepen Nigeria\u2019s less than 1 percent insurance penetration rate.\n\nThe National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) said it has been working to increase the capital base of insurance companies in the past few years to enable industry players to take on more risk and create innovative products.\n\nEven though NAICOM has suspended the recapitalisation exercise for insurers and reinsurers, following a court order issued 10 days before the deadline of the first tranche of the exercise which was to take effect on 31 December, 2020 analysts believe raising the capital base of the industry players will be a catalyst to deepening Nigeria\u2019s insurance penetration rate that has not recorded significant improvement in the last decade.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nMigration is the movement of persons from their place of usual residence and across international borders to a country of which they are not national, usually for the benefit of all \u2013 country of destination and country of origin.\n\nSuch movement which are due to different factors could be immidiate or remote and could regular or irregular.\n\nIrregular migration is that movement which takes place outside the regulatory norms of the sending, transit and destination country. Those who migrate are call migrants.\n\nA migrants is any person who is moving or has moved across international borders or within a state, away from his/her habitual place of residence, regardless of the person\u2019s legal status, cause (s) of the movement and whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary.\n\nRecently, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) organised a training programme for selected journalists in the print, radio, television and digital media spread across different states of Nigeria.\n\nThis was within the framework and understanding of the role of the media in information dissemination\n\nThe three days training held in the FCT, Abuja was part of IOM awareness raising interventions designed to create positive behavioral change among potential migrants, their families and friends to make safe and informed migration related decisions and promote the positive impact returning migrants bring to their home communities.\n\nBeyond awareness raising, the training was aimed at building the capacity of participants in providing legal, ethical and well informed migration related reporting, with focus on data analysis and reporting, migration and challenges of COVID-19, interviewing migrants and their families, especially vulnerable migrants, social media, migration and technology, migration terminologies, human rights, mental health psychosocial support in reporting, gender and migration, as well as working with editors in migration reporting, among others.\n\nIt was also aimed at equipping them with the requisite knowledge to adequately situate migration related matters in the public domain, besides being a platform to strengthen existing partnership between IOM and the media organisations.\n\nAlso, in line with the concept of bridging capacity gap in reporting on migration, the Civil Society Network on Migration and Development (CSOnetMADE) organised a 2-day Capacity Building Workshop for Media Agencies on Migration Reportage in the South-South region of Nigeria.\n\nIt was a follow up to a similar one in the South-East and North-West, with a prospect of another in the North-Central.\n\nIt was in recognition of the fact that in the context of migration, the media are crucial in delivering verified information, informed opinion, as well as balanced and incisive narrative.\n\nCSOnetMADE believes that the madia contribute and shape public, political perception on all aspects of life, including migration.\n\nFor instance, such perception portrays migration as a problem, rather than a multi-faceted global phenomenon, with a variety of challenges and opportunities.\n\nNowadays, migration is largely illustrated by scenes of boat crowded with migrants risking their lives to reach Europe.\n\nIt believes that the media reportage and use of concepts in reporting these scenario have not always been done with appropriate terminologies and understanding of the core migration concern, a development which presented some challenges for policy makers and service providers to effectively respond to the situation.\n\nThe fundamental questions that arose from the 2-day workshop were, how are\n\nmigration issues reported and documented by Nigerian media? How do the media portray migrants and migration? Are madiamen/women properly trained and equipped to report migration related matters?\n\nTo CSOnetMADE, \u201cIt is imperative for the media to understand migration issues if they, as relevant stakeholder of the Nigeria migration management mechanism must add value to migration governance and awareness creation on regular and irregular migration.\u201d\n\nFew days later, IOM organised a Town Hall meeting with key stakeholders for the purpose of establishing ways and links on how to integrate migration discussions in schools so as to bring about increased knowledge and awareness on the risk of irregular migration, human trafficking and smuggling of migrants.\n\nIt was also meant to promote the tenets of safe migration practices, as well as provide avenue for social cohesion for returned migrants to reduce stigma and help them reintegrate into the society.\n\nThe key stakeholders included the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Edo State Ministry of Education, Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Private School Owners Association and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).\n\nTown Hall meeting is one of the numerous avenues through which Migrants as Messengers (MaM), a project facilitated by IOM engages key stakeholders in communities to proffer solutions aimed at addressing the challenges of migration.\n\nMaM is a migrants centered approach to awareness raising \u2013 giving returned migrants opportunity to share their experiences, with IOM providing the platform.\n\nIt is a peer to peer awareness raising campaign through volunteer returned migrants to empower young people in Nigeria and some other West Africa countries to make informed decisions.\n\nTown Hall meeting also provide a platform for returned migrants to showcase their contributions toward addressing irregular migration by promoting safe and orderly migration, as well as sharing experiences and information as to opportunities in their home communities.\n\nThe move by IOM, though novel, is a demonstration of commitment to working with different cadre of journalists in promoting safe migration, telling stories of returnees and the benefits of migration without prejudice to the fact that migration also has its negative side.\n\nAs the United Nations Migration Agency, IOM in collaboration with other stakeholders between April 2017 and January 2021 facilitated the voluntary return of 17,359 Nigerians migrants from 22 countries, including Libya, Niger, Mali and other transit/destination countries.\n\nThe figure is made up of 10,141 males and 7,218 females. A further breakdown of the figure indicated that 12,667 returnees were between the 18 and 35 years; 2,436 were between 36 and 45 years; 1,640 were between 0 and 12 years; 363 were between 46 and 53 years; 153 were between 13 and 17 years while 100 were between 54 and 66 years.\n\nOf the total figure, Edo State has the highest figure of 38.1 percent, followed by Delta, 22.6 percent and Ogun State with 6 percent.\n\nThey were provided with immidiate protection and reintegration under the EU-IOM Initiative for Migrants Protection and Reintegration.\n\nIOM also act with its partners in the International and local communities to assist in meeting operational challenges of migration, advance understanding of migration issues as well as encourage social and economic development.\n\nHowever, since 2001 when IOM began operation, it has been in the vanguard of, not only promoting safe migration, it has also assisted migrants find meaning in life.\n\nThrough behavioral Change Communication (BCC) campaigns, outreaches, media reports, IOM seeks to equip vulnerable migrants with the information they need to migrate safely and access assistance when necessary, hence the setting up of three Migrants Resource Centre, each in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City in Edo State.\n\nThe centers offer free information services on migration options to empower potential Nigerian Labour Migrants make informed decisions.\n\nIOM offers Technical Support for the implementation of Labour Migration policy Action Plan which aims at managing labour migration and mobilising diaspora for international development.\n\nIt helped review the National Labour Migration Policy and the National Policy on Migration to ensure that emerging migration issues were well captured and facilitated the high level meeting that led to the adoption of draft and final policies.\n\nIOM aims to address the root causes of vulnerability to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants through engagement with the media and targeted interventions at the individual, household, commmunity and structural levels.\n\nFor instance, it provides mental health psychosocial support and counseling, not only to returned migrants, but to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).\n\nMore often than not, the most vulnerable get additional support through reintegration assistance.\n\nA case in point is one Sandra (not real name), an AVR after four years harrowing experience in Libya courtesy of IoM presently operates an hair dressing saloon in the outskirt of Benin City.\n\nShe disclosed to this writer that barely few months after her return, not been able to integrate speedily and in what seems to her as IoM delay in assisting her with empowerment tools, set out to return to Libya, but for the later and timely intervention by IoM with empowerment tools worth over #800,000.\n\nToday, she operates a thriving hair dressing saloon.\n\nAVR (Assisted Voluntary Returnee) include those who traveled for economic reasons, unaccompanied children and survivors of trafficking. IoM assist them with travel logistics and flights. Many receive protection support as well.\n\nOver the years, and based on partnership, IoM has supported efforts of Nigeria government to manage migration, while strong collaboration has established with stakeholders on migration, both nationally and internationally in order to enhance border management, fight human trafficking, reduce irregular migration and mainstream migration policy decisions.\n\nIts migration policy based research contributes to evidenced-based policies on migration that address the needs of migrants and supports the national capacity to address them.\n\nAs at today, IOM is a reputed UN agency that promotes migration policies and legislation which are coherent, comprehensive and in line with national realities and which correspond to international norms and good practices.\n\nIt is a leading and accredited inter-governmental organisation working with migrants and government to respond to contemporary migration challenges. It is well positioned to build on its grassroots experience and provide guidance on migration policy. It provides information, advice and support to further the efforts of its stakeholders to develop effective national, regional and global migration management policies and strategies, as well as contributes to increased dialogue between migration stakeholders at bilateral, regional and global levels.\n\n...",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nPassing blames not the solution \u2013 Governor\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is high optimism among Oil and gas experts and economic analysts that the target of expanding gas consumption in Nigeria would be substantially achieved with appropriate deployment of the N250bn gas intervention fund set aside by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe use of cooking gas in Nigeria increased to one million metric tonnes in 2020 from about 400MT consumption level recorded four years ago. But operators attribute the increase to the removal of the subsidy on kerosene, noting that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration was still far from the national target of five million metric tonnes set for next year.\n\nIt is no longer debatable that Nigeria is endowed with enormous natural gas resource. However, how to use this resource to develop and transform the nation\u2019s economy and add significant value to the lives of its citizens remains a major issue for decades.\n\nAccording to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013the regulator of activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as at January 2020, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stood at 203.16trillion cubic feet. The nation\u2019s unproven gas reserve is still at about 600trillion cubic feet. These numbers no doubt put Nigeria as a major player in the world gas market, ranking as the ninth largest gas producer globally and the number one on the African continent.\n\nFor long, there have been conversations around how Nigeria can leverage the vast opportunities in its gas resource to open up the country for investments, which will in turn lead to massive job creation, enhanced energy efficiency, increased productivity as well as increased revenue to both government and businesses.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria prides itself as a major exporter of LNG to the world via the Nigeria LNG Limited, making gas available for domestic use through business-friendly government policies and actions will help a great deal in driving economic diversification and competition.\n\nPlayers in the country\u2019s gas sector are of the view that there is no better time to optimise the potential of the gas resources than now that the whole world is struggling to survive the impact of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo them, the pandemic and its attendant economic turmoil has presented an opportunity for the country to look inward by prioritising in-country utilisation of the abundant gas resources. They believe there should be increased attention to the development of gas infrastructure in Nigeria and the deepening of domestic consumption and utilisation of the commodity in order to boost the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, despite the abundant gas potential, Nigeria still struggles to develop and grow its economy, a situation that makes jest of the country at the international front.\n\n\u201cNigeria does represent quite an interesting paradox. We are major resource holders, major exporter of gas, at the same time we struggle on the domestic front with de-industrialization, with unmet domestic gas demand and insufficiency in gas supply to the power sector for power generation,\u201d President of the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Mrs Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, once said.\n\nCBN to the rescue\n\nIn order to make Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes, the federal government introduced the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP). Under the NGEP, the CBN is providing N250 billion loan to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain as part of its efforts to stimulate finance to critical sectors of the economy.\n\nIn a guideline titled \u2018Framework for the implementation of intervention facility for the national gas expansion programme\u2019, CBN set N10bn as the maximum loan an obligor can access under its N250bn intervention fund for the gas sector.\n\nPart of the term loan conditions for manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, was that the term loan, \u201cShall be determined based on the activity and shall not exceed N10bn per obligor. Working capital is maximum of N500m per obligor.\u201d\n\nIt said the objectives of the facility included improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain; and also to stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nThe facility, the apex bank said, also aimed to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nIt would also fast-track the development of gas-based industries particularly petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) to support large industries, such as agriculture, textile, and related industries; provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market; and boost employment across the country.\n\nEligible activities under the intervention include establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants; establishment of gas cylinder manufacturing plants; establishment of L-CNG regasification modular systems; and establishment of auto gas conversion kits or components manufacturing plants.\n\nOthers are establishment of CNG primary and secondary compression stations; establishment and manufacturing of LPG retail skid tanks and refilling equipment; development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure; and enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets.\n\nIt also involves the establishment/expansion of micro distribution outlets and service centres for LPG sales, domestic cylinder injection and exchange; and any other mid to downstream gas value chain related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe intervention fund by CBN is a welcome development because it will not only support in deepening the consumption of gas but will help ameliorate sicknesses caused by the use of firewood,\u201d an economic analyst with interest in public health, Mr. Bath Onwuachu, told our correspondent.\n\nHe urged operators in the gas industry to take advantage of the fund to further expand the sector and increase the penetration of gas consumption. According to Onwuachu, deepening of gas usage would reduce the rate of deforestation, a development that would impact positively on the environment.\n\nMr. Lambert Ojo, a gas processing and evaporative cooling specialist, believes the intervention for local investors in the gas sector would stimulate the economy. He, however, called for a transparent and seamless process when obtaining the facility from the apex bank in order to encourage industry players.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to do in the domestic gas space. What is happening internationally in the near future should not affect us because there\u2019s a lot we can do with our resource,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Ahmed Bobboi, stated that PEF was aligning with the CBN and the federal government to further deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria. He said to achieve this, the agency was planning to equalise gas price so as to ensure that more citizens had access to gas.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\u201d",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state, Premium Times reported.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.\n\nCredit: Premium Times",

          "text": "The restiveness in Imo state continued Sunday with security agents drawn from the army, police and related agencies repelling attack on the state police command in Owerri, the state capital.\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information and Strategies, Declan Mbadiwe Emelumba, was not that lucky as Ubulu-Ihejiofor, his country home in Oru West local government area of the state, was razed by some unidentified gunmen in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nAnd in yet another attack in Delta state, a police station was set ablaze with police killing six suspected kidnappers in a fierce gun duel.\n\nThe tragic developments, Blueprint gathered, have heightened tension in the entire South-east and the adjoining states.\n\nImo attack\n\nConfirming the botched attack on the Imo state police command in a statement in Owerri, the command\u2019s spokesman, Bala Elkana said: \u201cThe attackers, who came in a white Hummer bus, wanted to access the Command Headquarters through Works Layout around Alvan Nursery and Primary School Owerri but had a bloody fight with the security forces.\n\n\u201cThey were first intercepted by the Military at the outer perimeter cordon provided for the Police. Five of the hoodlums were killed in action (KIA) including Joseph Uka Nnachi alias King of Dragons.\n\n\u201cOne suspect Stanley Osinachi \u2018m\u2019 30 years old of Achi/Mberi , Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State was arrested and presently aiding investigation. He confirmed that Dragon is the leader of the gang in Imo State reporting to their supreme leader Nnamdi Kanu. He stated that, they belong to the proscribed IPOB and ESN.\u201d\n\nElkana further said four AK 47 rifles with 2000 rounds of live ammunition and large number of explosives were recovered from the scene and that the rifles breech numbers were crosschecked and found to be the same police rifles stolen by the hoodlums from the Police station at Omuma on 31st May, 2021, during which four policemen were killed.\n\nHe also said, as found in a viral video, it was the same gang that blocked the Orji Flyover some days ago during which three people were killed, including a woman who was blindfolded.\n\nThe police spokesman also quoted the Commissioner of Police in the state, Abutu Yaro, as commending the gallant efforts of the security forces \u201cwho put their lives on the line to ensure the restoration of normalcy in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the CP pleaded with those still in possession of stolen weapons to return them to the nearest police stations.\n\nOther recovered items were: Assault (AR) Rifle Breach No: 03018058;\n\nAssault (AR) Rifle Breach N0: 070007055; Assault (AR) RIFLE Breach No: 5801297: Six locally fabricated Explosive Devices; Police Beret Cap;\n\n7 AK47 Magazines fully loaded; 1 military cap; 1 military cardigan (Polo);\n\n1 Silver Coloured Mini Bus with Reg N0: WAM-8673 B ABD; I Hummer Bus with Reg No: KED-382 X laden with Explosive Devices.\n\nCommissioner\u2019s house burnt\n\nIn a related development, Blueprint gathered that two houses in the compound of the state\u2019s commissioner for information and strategies, were set ablaze.\n\nThe development, Blueprint gathered, left villagers running helter-skelter and scampering into the bush for safety as news of the arrival of security forces filtered the air.\n\nMr Emelumba confirmed the development when contacted by one of our correspondents.\n\nSimilar incident occurred at Ibiasoegbe, a neighbouring village three days ago where three persons, including a policeman was killed.\n\nEmelumba is believed to be a member of the kitchen cabinet of the Hope Uzodimma administration and was one of the commissioners who survived a recent cabinet reshuffle by the governor.\n\nDelta\n\nMeanwhile, the Delta state Police command Sunday killed six suspected armed robbers and kidnappers terrorising the state.\n\nThe hoodlums were engaged in a gun duel by the police operatives in their hideout, during which six of them were killed on the spot.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state police public relations officer, DSP Bright Edafe said, \u201cAt about 1435hrs on 5/6/21, acting on a tip off, the commissioner of police Delta state, deployed joint tactical teams of the command who stormed the hideout of suspected armed robbers/kidnappers, engaged the hoodlums in a serious gun duel.\u201d\n\nHe said the hoodlums numbering about 20, stormed Ashaka police station in the early hours of Sunday and set it ablaze along with the patrol vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey threw IEDS at the station, shot sporadically, and set the police station that was built by the community/DESOPADEC ablaze, and also burnt down one patrol vehicle also bought for the police division by good people of the community just to ensure that police presence is not felt.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that no life was lost and no arm was taken away. Unprovoked attacks on the police will not deter the police from providing the needed security in any community in Delta state,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDSP Edafe further said the joint security team killed six of the criminals while others fled with gunshot injuries into the bush, with one AK 47 rifle, one pump action gun, one AK 47 magazine with 25 live ammunition recovered.\n\nThe PPRO also said: \u201cOn 5/6/21 at about 2130hours, the men of Delta state command while on stop and search duty along Patani-Bayelsa road intercepted a sienna bus with Reg. no. LSR 813 XL with four occupants, on sighting the police, they quickly tried to manoeuvre in a bid to escape, the police went after them.\n\n\u201cOn searching the vehicle, one locally made Barretta Pistol was recovered, and four suspects namely, Efe Oyenikoro \u2018m\u2019 Felix George \u2018m\u2019 Emmanuel Job \u2018m\u2019 Joan Yapiteghe \u2018m\u2019 were arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Ari Muhammed Ali has given marching order to\n\nOyo attack\n\nAlso in another development, no fewer than 10 people were Saturday night feared killed in Igangan, Ibarapa North local government of Oyo state by armed men suspected to be bandits\n\nThe gunmen were said to have invaded the town in the night on about 20 motorcycles shooting sporadically during which the palace of the traditional ruler of the town, Asigangan and a popular petroleum station were razed\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen said to be numbering about 50 shot at those trying to escape from the scene of confusion.\n\nThe state secretary of farmers union, based in the town, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said in the ensuing melee, no fewer than 10 people were reportedly killed.\n\nAdeagbo gave the breakdown of the casualties to include five residents and five of the bandits, saying, the gunmen waged war on Igangan from about12 midnight today (Sunday).\n\n\u201cThey burnt many properties- cars, a truck and burnt a petrol filling station. We will know the exact number of people killed, those injured and the number of properties they destroyed in the morning. It is still dark now, things will be clearer later,\u201d he said.\n\nConfirming the attack, the state Police command in a statement said: \u201cOn Saturday at about 2310hrs, a yet to be ascertained number of unknown assailants invaded Igangan town with dangerous weapons in a bid to create unrest in the town.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Adewale Osifeso said: \u201cThe unscrupulous elements were however repelled by a combination of Operational and tactical assets immediately deployed to the scene to restore normalcy.

          "text": "Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Nigeria\u2019s terrorist group Boko Haram killed himself in a fight against rival jihadist fighters, AFP is reporting.\n\nIn an audio recording received by the news agency, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), a rival militant group said Shekau died detonating explosives on himself after a battle between the two groups.\n\nThe confirmation comes Sunday, two weeks after reports emerged that Shekau had died.\n\nHis death marks a major shift in Nigeria\u2019s 12-year-old jihadist insurgency that has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around two million in the northeast.\n\nBoko Haram has not yet officially commented on the death of their leader while the Nigerian army said it was investigating the claim.\n\n\u201cShekau preferred to be humiliated in the hereafter to getting humiliated on Earth. He killed himself instantly by detonating an explosive,\u201d said a voice resembling that of ISWAP leader Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, speaking in the Kanuri language.\n\nThe audio, which was not dated, was given to AFP by the same source who conveyed previous messages from the group.\n\nISWAP described in the audio how it sent fighters to Boko Haram\u2019s enclave in the Sambisa forest, that they found Shekau sitting inside his house and engaged him in a firefight.\n\n\u201cFrom there he retreated and escaped, ran and roamed the bushes for five days. However, the fighters kept searching and hunting for him before they were able to locate him,\u201d the voice said.\n\nAfter finding him in the bush, ISWAP fighters urged him and his followers to repent, the voice added, but Shekau refused and killed himself.\n\n\u201cWe are so happy,\u201d the voice said, describing Shekau as \u201cthe big troublemaker, persecutor and destructive leader of the nation.\u201d\n\nISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016, objecting to Shekau\u2019s indiscriminate targeting of Muslim civilians and use of women suicide bombers.\n\n\u201cThis was someone who committed unimaginable terrorism and atrocities. For how long has he been leading people astray? How many times has he destroyed and abused people?\u201d the voice said.\n\nIn the past two years, ISWAP emerged as the more dominant force in the region, carrying out large-scale attacks against the Nigerian military.\n\nAs the group now looks to absorb Shekau\u2019s fighters and territory, Nigeria\u2019s army potentially faces a more unified jihadist force, analysts say.\n\nBut ISWAP may also struggle to control or persuade Boko Haram factions loyal to Shekau outside Sambisa, especially in border areas.\n\n\u201cIt may not be over yet,\u201d one security source said. \u201cISWAP will have to subdue or convince these camps to coalesce (them) into its fold to fully consolidate its control.\u201d\n\nJihadist infighting may present opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s army to seize.\n\nBut should ISWAP absorb part of Shekau\u2019s men and weapons, it might be in a position to cut off roads to and from the Borno state capital Maiduguri, analysts said.",

          "title": "Turkish Mafia Boss Dishes Dirt, Becomes YouTube Phenomenon",
          "text": "From alleged drug trafficking and a murder cover-up to weapons transfers to Islamic militants, a convicted crime ringleader has been dishing the dirt on members of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling party through a series of tell-all videos that have captivated the nation and turned him into an unlikely social media phenomenon.\n\nSedat Peker, a 49-year-old fugitive crime boss, who once openly supported Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, has been releasing nearly 90-minute long videos from his stated base in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, making scandalous but yet-unproven drip-by-drip allegations, in an apparent bid to settle scores with political figures.\n\nThe weekly YouTube videos have been viewed more than 75 million times, causing an uproar, heightening concerns over Turkish state corruption and putting officials on the defensive. They have also exposed alleged rifts between rival factions within the ruling party and added to Erdogan\u2019s troubles as he battles an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a couple in Istanbul were absorbed while watching Peker\u2019s latest release. They were among millions in Turkey who tuned in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve added (Peker\u2019s videos) to the category of TV series I watch every week,\u201d Gulistan Atas said. \u201cJust like a TV episode, I wait in excitement, and every week on Sunday, we prepare our breakfast when we get up and watch them along with our breakfast.\u201d\n\nClad in a waistcoat or a half-buttoned shirt displaying a medallion, Peker taunts his opponents from behind a desk with neatly arranged notes, prayer beads and books, promising to bring their downfall using nothing more than a \u201ctripod and a camera.\u201d\n\nHis initial videos targeted former Interior Minister Mehmet Agar and his son, Tolga, a ruling party lawmaker, whom he accused of raping a young Kazakh journalism student and later covering up her murder as a suicide. Mehmet Agar, Peker suggested, misappropriated a luxury marina that may have been used in drug trafficking operations. Agar later resigned from the marina\u2019s board.\n\nSubsequent videos leveled accusations against business people and media figures close to the government, as well as former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim\u2019s son, claiming he was involved in drug smuggling from Venezuela. But the target of Peker\u2019s most vitriolic and mocking attacks is Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, whom he accuses of abuse of power and corruption while aiming to become Turkey\u2019s president. Peker justifies the tell-all by saying Soylu betrayed him despite the crime leader\u2019s help to defeat a rival faction within the ruling party.\n\nAll those implicated have rejected Peker\u2019s accusations.\n\nIn an explosive claim with international dimensions, the mob boss said that a former security advisor to Erdogan accused of leading a paramilitary force had sent weapons to Al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria. Erdogan hasn\u2019t yet addressed those claims although the government has in the past denied allegations that it had armed jihadis.\n\nErdogan ignored the Peker videos for weeks, but broke his silence on May 26, when he dismissed earlier allegations by the mafia leader as a conspiracy against Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe will spoil these games, these plots. No one should doubt that we will disrupt this devious operation,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWe pursue members of criminal gangs wherever in the world they flee to \u2026 We will not leave these criminals alone until we bring them back to our country and hand them over to the judiciary.\u201d\n\nPeker responded to Erdogan that week and suggested that the Turkish strongman could be the focus of future videos. He later said he would speak about Erdogan after his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on June 14 so as not to \u201cweaken his hand.\u201d In his latest video Sunday, he said his revelations would be conducted with respect and wouldn\u2019t hurt the state itself.\n\n\u201cWill finding and bringing me (to Turkey) change the reality,\u201d he said.\n\nOpposition parties, meanwhile, have seized on the allegations to demand the resignations of implicated figures as well as parliamentary and judiciary inquiries.\n\nThe ruling party and its nationalist allies have blocked opposition bids to launch parliamentary inquiries into Peker\u2019s claims as well as into the arms smuggling allegations.\n\nAuthorities have issued a new warrant for Peker\u2019s arrest.\n\nCan Selcuki, the director of polling and analysis platform Turkiye Raporu, said of Peker: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that he\u2019s a criminal,\u201d but explained the videos\u2019 popularity as a need for information.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me people are asking this illegal operator these questions because they can\u2019t get answers elsewhere. And this tells me there\u2019s a growing demand in Turkish society for more transparency,\u201d Selcuki said.\n\nPeker addresses his viewers, especially people under age 40, as the real owners of Turkey who have the power of demanding accountability and change.\n\nA nationalist who advocates unity between Turkic-speaking nations, Peker has been in and out of prison since age 17 for his involvement in organized crime and other offenses. After his last release from prison in 2014, he held rallies to support Erdogan\u2019s party and leveled threats against his opponents. His 2015 wedding to Ozge Peker, who was his lawyer, drew a host of celebrity guests.\n\nIn April, an operation was launched against Peker\u2019s group, leading to the arrest of around 60 of his associates.\n\nHis home in Istanbul was also searched.
