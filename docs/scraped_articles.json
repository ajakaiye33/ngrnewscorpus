          "title": "Lusting after a lad could give a cougar a bad name",
          "text": "By Bunmi Sofola\n\nWhat unbridled passion could make a woman seduce a lad? Isn\u2019t every gangling boy\u2019s fantasy, luring a matured woman to bed for his first and subsequent sexual experiences? Ironically, there are women out there who find unfettered lads attractive. Nora was one of them \u2013 until she got her fingers burnt.\n\nA divorced mother of two lovely boys, by age 36, she\u2019d been divorced but living in her own house with a couple of cars to compliment her-life-style.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Veron two years ago, he\u2019d just finished with his OND and was on his year working experience \u2013 and he was serving it at a friend\u2019s office,\u201d said Vera. \u201cHe had no job description \u2013 he was more of a man Friday who did odd jobs. When I visited this friend of mine on this fateful day, I was feeling really famished and she quickly sent Veron to get us some food to eat.\n\nREAD ALSO: Being a successful cougar is an art\n\n\u201cI teased him about being very young with a lot of girl-friends but he smiled shyly. He said he\u2019d soon be 24 \u2013 but his body \u2013 over 6ft, broad shoulders and slim hips, screamed sexuality. He once let it slip that he was still a virgin and I showed surprise. Was he kidding? Then I felt excited \u2013 to this day, I\u2019d never know why.\n\nIt would be quite a pleasure teaching him a trick or two about sex. It would be a teacher/pupil fantasy. My chance to give him sex education. Afterall, it\u2019s a belief that women hit their sexual peak in their 30s, and men 20. We\u2019d be in perfect sync. Lust had kicked in.\n\n\u201cMy first son was to be 12 a couple of weeks later and I invited him to attend. He hung around till the end of the party. He was a bit tipsy by this time. That might have encouraged his next move \u2013 afterall I didn\u2019t exactly hide the fact I found him attractive.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we were alone, he pulled me to him and kissed me hard. I was a bit embarrassed. I\u2019d forgotten his inexperience and quickly offered him more drinks before sending him on his way I told him to come back the next day when the children would be at their grandma\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe next day, as soon as I led him to the bedroom he dived into the bed, quickly peeling off his clothes. As I stripped to my silky undies, he was virtually quivering. Was it from passion? Nerves? Quietly, I plotted how to approach this shy, inexperienced man meeting up with a woman who\u2019d promised him sex.\n\n\u201cOf course I was nervous because I wanted his first time to feel special. \u2018I love you \u2026\u2019 he whispered. Of course he didn\u2019t, I told myself. Every strappling lad wants sex, lots of it. Well, just like me! And so it started \u2013 the education of Veron. By the time I sent him home, he\u2019d gained a life time experience. My friends found it hilarious when I told them. They warned it wouldn\u2019t last. But who cared? This wasn\u2019t about love, it was animal passion.\n\nA few months after, he confessed again that he loved me. I told him not to be silly. That he\u2019s got his whole life ahead of him, why tie himself down to a mother of two? \u2018Don\u2019t you feel the same abut me?\u2019 he asked, hurt, I told him I did, convinced he\u2019d soon get bored when he found much younger girls. But his visits became more and more frequent.\n\nHe even visited when the kids were around and helped them with their homework. What was he playing at? He kept on assuring me of his loyalty and I was a bit annoyed. Had he thought about the age gap? \u2018I don\u2019t care about that. Why should you?\u2019 he pleaded. Then it was accusations and questions when we were apart, moody silence when we were together. In short, our romps wasn\u2019t fun any more.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he left my place for his parents\u2019 house, my mobile would beep with texts. Are you going out later? Who with? Has uncle Akin been around?\u2019 that last question made me see red. \u2018Uncle Akin\u2019 was an ex-boyfriend who\u2019d become a good friend nothing more. I warned him to be more matured the way he behaved but it was obvious he was infatuated with me.\n\n\u201cPoor thing, breaking his heart hadn\u2019t been part of the plan. All I wanted to do was introduced him to sex, not scar him forever. But the more he sulked, the more I saw him for who he was \u2013 an adolescent grappling with his emotions. Now, to my shame, I realised that he wasn\u2019t matured enough to handle casual sex. To prevent things from reaching a dangerous proportion, he would have to go.\n\n\u201cAfter I\u2019d reached this decision, I was looking for ways to make the break less hurtful when he visited and started sulking he saw \u2018Uncle Akin\u2019 and I together somewhere. Whether or not he was bluffing was irrelevant here. I was really fed up with the nuisance he\u2019d been. Quietly, I held his hand and told him: \u2018look, this is not working, I can\u2019t do this any more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, you need to get a girl of your age.\u201d He stared at me for a few seconds, then burst into tears. \u2018You don\u2019t mean it,\u2019 he wept. \u2018We can\u2019t be over, I love you. You said yourself that you loved me \u2026\u2019 I\u2019d never felt so ashamed in my life. Now I saw clearly the lesson I\u2019d inadvertently thought the poor boy. That love hurts and women can\u2019t be trusted. All because I\u2019d been too selfish to resist his strappling physique.\n\n\u201cThe days that followed were awful. There was no ignoring his pain. He texted, phoned, came round, begged. But I couldn\u2019t give in. I\u2019d used the poor boy for sex and I hated myself for it. There was no need to prolong his suffering. In the end he got the message.\n\n\u201cI hope some day he will move on with his life \u2013 just as I have moved on by going out with a man my age with whom I could have a relationship that is right. Not a teacher and pupil; not vixen and virgin. Youth and experience certainly don\u2019t mix.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d since gone back to college and my friend who was his boos told me he called me a heartless bitch. That I used him as a plaything, a sex toy. He said he fell for me after I\u2019d led him on to believe I loved him. I felt really sorry for him. What could have been a fun thing had now turned into a sordid affair that I regretted\u2026\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Following the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets and of course the banning of the operations of the micro blogging site \u2018Twitter\u2019 in Nigeria, by the Nigerian Federal Government yesterday, Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria, NPAN, Saturday joined thousands of Nigerians in condemning the decision of the current administration.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Vanguard, signed by the President, Kabiru A. Yusuf, the association advised President Buhari\u2019s led administration to rescind its decision in favour of dialogue.\n\nRead the statement below:\n\n\u201cNigeria yesterday suspended, indefinitely, the operation of the popular social media platform Twitter, for deleting the warning of President Muhammadu Buhari to the insurrectionists in South East Nigeria who have been vandalizing the symbols of the authority of the state. These lawless ones have been committing arson against public assets like police stations, prisons and the courts; freeing prisoners from lawful custody, killing policemen and soldiers as well as harmless civilians. It is a state of fear in the South East of Nigeria as in almost all over the country where terrorists, Kidnappers, farmer/herder clashes have almost crippled Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is to those persons that President Buhari warned that they may be ignorant of the cost of violence and may attract severe sanctions, reminiscent of the 30-month Nigerian civil war, if they persist in unrestrained violence and challenge to the authority of the state.\n\nIt is that threat of maximum state reparisal that Twitter found objectionable, according to its stated policy and sanctioned President Buhari with a deletion. This is not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy. It did so to President Donald Trump of the United States of America, to global aplomb when Trump instigated violence against the Capitol.\n\nNigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of Buhari while pampering an unrestrained Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Kanu has used same Twitter not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nTo the extent that Twitter may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari and shown an uneven application of its rules against separatist Kanu, its sincerity stands questioned. It should correct itself.\n\nHowever, The Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), thinks that the suspension of Twitters operation by Nigerian is wrong and an overreaction.\n\nThe action would not win us friends as closure of public space limits public discourse and democratic advancement. It is a futile exercise in any case, as other platforms are more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards Nigeria.\n\nTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population who have prospered by its operation.\n\nThe NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes. .\n\nThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless is seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue\u201d.",

Last weekend, a truck of onions with about 500 bags of the commodity was ransacked by members of the IPOB in a daylight robbery in Owerri. They sold the onions and ran away with the money before the police could save the other truck they similarly took.\n\nAttacks: Unknown gunmen are our young men, women \u2013 Gov Umahi\n\n\u201cThrough all these, as individual leaders and collectively, we\u2019ve maintained a studied silence by avoiding anything that will further rock the boat. Rather, we\u2019ve been restraining our own people who are victims of these atrocities by preaching patience and peace. Regrettably but curiously, our friends and compatriots, leaders of Igbo extraction, have remained dead silent in the face of increasing assault and effort by their own people to stock nationwide mayhem.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason it is, I want to loudly call them out to speak up. Silence is no longer acceptable in the face of this clear danger and threat against the country.\n\n\u201cThe silence by political leaders and other prominent persons from that part of the country tells us only one thing: Their tacit approval for the activities of the murderous IPOB gangs.\n\n\u201cAs leaders of our own people, we\u2019ve been under intense pressure over the current situation. We can\u2019t bear it any longer. If leaders from the South-East feel they can allow their own people to do what they want, we may have no choice but to stop dousing the increasing tension among our own followers.\u201d\n\nBoat mishap: Tambuwal, Wamakko react to death of 13 persons in Sokoto",

          "title": "BOS, LASU and dance of the naked gods",
          "text": "By Segun Ayobolu\n\nIt is over three and a half decades now since I read the renowned novelist, Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike\u2019 s satirical novel on politics, intrigues, illicit romance, nepotism, ethnicity and even resort to fetish rituals in an academic community titled \u2018The Naked Gods\u2019. Situated in a fictive University of Shonghai shortly before the independence of the Republic of Shonghai, the story is about the intense jostling and vicious contestation among the academics of the university not only over which educational tradition, British or American, the institution would adopt after independence but also who would become its pioneer post-independence Vice Chancellor. In the process, the fabled gods of academia and repositories of the brightest and best of a society\u2019s intellect, showed that they were human after all as they resorted to all manner of underhand tactics, blackmail, fetishism and manipulation to outdo one another.\n\nIn the ongoing protracted process to appoint the 9th Vice Chancellor of the Lagos State University (LASU), almost five decades after Chukwuemeka Ike\u2019s novel was published, it is evident that some of the fabled gods of academia still dance naked in the marketplace to our utter national embarrassment. Even as he is focused on steering the ship of his state through the turbulent waters of the pernicious Coronavirus pandemic, leading the state to full recovery from the destructive effects of the #EndSars violence as well as meeting the challenge of the daily influx of thousands of Nigerians from all over the country into Lagos in search of the golden fleece, Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu (BOS) has to cope with the additional and entirely avoidable headache of ensuring the emergence of a new Vice Chancellor for LASU through a transparent and credible process.\n\nThe governor has had to reject the outcome of two botched selection processes and has ordered that the exercise start all over de novo. What should be a routine exercise has become a time-consuming and energy-sapping affair that neither the institution nor the state can afford. Should BOS not simply have anointed a candidate, made his position known to the institution\u2019s Governing Council and avoided all the time-wasting complications of seeking to adhere to due process? That was the view of a friend of mine who is not only a brilliant lawyer but also an accomplished public administrator. He wondered why the governor was not more assertive and forceful in utilizing the expansive powers of his office particularly in handling the LASU VC debacle.\n\nMy response was that the greatest strength and asset of BOS lie exactly in his restrained and humble disposition to the use of power and his unceasing readiness to subject himself to the constraints of extant rules and regulations. For, it is actually moral and intellectual pygmies who have the pitiable psychological need to deploy power with tyrannous viciousness as some state governors are wont to do. My cerebral colleague, Olakunle Abimbola, in a recent piece, referred in this respect to what he described as BOS\u2019s collegial approach to governance, an attitude that hinges on remarkable self-assurance and emotional security on the part of a leader. As the Yoruba say, yiyo ekun bi ti ojo ko. (The stealthy steps of a lion are due neither to fear nor cowardice).\n\nIt is instructive that on assumption of office, BOS renewed the appointment of Professor Adebayo Ninalowo as Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of LASU. The renowned sociologist had been appointed to that position by former governor Akinwumi Ambode. Surely, if BOS had any ulterior motive, he could have appointed a Chairman and membership of Council that would simply rubber stamp his preferences in the institution. No less important is the fact that BOS did not unilaterally take the decision to dissolve the immediate past Governing Council as well as remove Ninalowo from office as Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council. Rather, this was one of the recommendations of the Special Visitation Panel to LASU on the Appointment of a Vice Chancellor, which comprised such eminent Nigerians as Pro-Chancellor of Ekiti State University and former Vice Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Professor Bamitale Omole, as Chairman, former Vice Chancellor of University of Port Harcourt, Professor Joseph Ajenka, renowned political scientist, Professor Ayo Olukotun, former Solicitor General of Lagos State, Mr. Lawal Pedro, former Registrar of the University of Ibadan, Olujimi Olukoya and a director in the Lagos State public service, Funmilola Olajide who was the panel\u2019s secretary.\n\nThe Visitation Panel was unequivocal in its recommendation of the dissolution of the Governing Council and the removal of Professor Ninalowo as Pro-Chancellor and Chairman for \u201cflagrant contravention of extant laws, breach of due process, failure and total disregard to follow its own laid down criteria for the appointment of the 9th Vice Chancellor as publicly advertised\u201d. Other recommendations of the panel adopted by the Visitor are that members of the Joint Council and the Senate Committee who participated in the two previous failed exercises be exempted from participation in a new exercise; the Acting Vice Chancellor and Management of the university are to elect new Council members from the Senate; the Registrar and Secretary to the Council to proceed on immediate leave having failed to advise the Joint Council and Senate Committee against taking wrong decisions and an Acting Registrar to be appointed to superintend over a new selection exercise.\n\nResponding to these decisions in a half page advertorial in a national newspaper, Professor Ninalowo said he had \u201cto correct the wrong narratives contained in the release by the State Government\u201d which \u201cgives the impression that Governing Council and Joint Committee acted irresponsibly and failed to follow the guiding rules for the process\u201d. In nominating three applicants for the position, he said, the law was fully complied with and \u201cIn those areas where discretion was exercised by the Joint Committee as part of fulfilling responsibilities to ensure a fair competitive process, we took due consideration of all relevant information in cognizance of the enabling Law and other guiding rules and regulations\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, in a comprehensive response to Professor Ninalowo\u2019s statement, the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to the LASU chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr Tony Dansu and Dr Adeolu Oyekan, stated the alleged breaches in the selection process by the Governing Council under Ninalowo\u2019s leadership. According to ASUU, the adverts placement for the position of the Vice Chancellor was executively done by Ninalowo without the involvement of Council as required by the law. Again, in the advert for the vacant position of Vice Chancellor placed in The Guardian newspaper of 14th January, 2021, the conditions for qualification were allegedly reviewed by inserting PhD/Fellowship and reducing post-professorial experience from 10 years to 5 years without the input of Council. Also, ASUU argued that \u201cthe three members of Council that served on the Joint Council and Senate Selection Committee, which is a creation of the Law, were not elected by Council, in flagrant violation of the law\u201d.\n\nASUU noted that the advertisements placed for the vacant position of Vice Chancellor required that an applicant to qualify \u201cmust be a scholar with international appeal having made significant impact in areas such as international supervision and examination of PhD candidates, conference presentations etc\u201d and \u201cmust demonstrate relentless scholarship impact within and outside the country in terms of continuous production of books, papers, students supervised (especially PhD), exchanges, collaborations after his/her attainment of the rank of Professor\u201d. The union argued, quite plausibly in my view, that it is difficult for applicants without a PhD to be credibly rated above those with this requisite qualification as done in the two cancelled exercises. Again, ASUU pointed out that another of the shortlisted recommended candidates did not meet the condition in the vacancy advertorial that an applicant \u201cshould be a distinguished scholar of the rank of professor of ten (10) years standing with several years of teaching and research in a university\u201d.\n\nIn his statement on the decisions of the State Government on the matter, Professor Ninalowo touted his four decades of service in the university system as well as his reputation as a scholar and administrator. It is precisely because of this that much more was expected of him in the sensitive position of Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council than he delivered. As the LASU chapter of ASUU succinctly put it, \u201cHis interest in an anointed candidate became very glaring where the candidates who in the first botched selection process emerged second and third were consigned to the rear in the second, equally botched, exercise where the assessment tools did not significantly change; and also when he ranked candidates with no PhD degree first, second and third to leave the visitor with no option than to pick his anointed candidate without being bothered about the resultant effect on the university\u201d.\n\nThe universities of any country are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, of what use is it? Our universities cannot rise to their full potentials and serve as heralds of national development if they are not led by the brightest and best minds as well as models of character and integrity irrespective of ethnic origin, region or faith. BOS must be commended for being a stickler for due process and giving stipulated procedures and regulations the opportunity to work successfully at LASU, which has unquestionably become a citadel of learning of high repute and has a glorious future ahead.",

The judiciary has collected the first and second quarters of their capital fund. We still use our money to do infrastructure for them in spite of the fact that we gave them their capital expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who said the state government had commenced implementation of no work, no pay, against the striking workers, reiterated that he would never sign any agreement with the JUSUN because both judicial and legislative arms of government in the state were enjoying full autonomy.\n\n\u201cGovernors\u2019 Forum is not a Government. It is an association of Governors to share ideas and not to sign agreements on behalf on State governments.\n\n\u201cEven when they say something, I will have to come back to the state and call State Executive Council meeting, and we will take it as our resolution that this is what we are going to do. So, whatever they have signed with JUSUN, let me tell you people, it is not binding on Rivers State government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor noted that the Rivers State University secured the support of the state government because of the harmonious relationship between the university management and the governing council.\n\nHe said that despite the ethnic coloration given to the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor, they had justified their positions following their achievements in turning around the fortunes of the institution.\n\nWike said the infrastructure of the institution had been upgraded through the establishment of four additional campuses to avail Rivers people more access to tertiary education.\n\nHe said the remuneration and other conditions of teaching and non-teaching staff had also been enhanced.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the construction faculty buildings for Basic Clinical Sciences, Clinical Science and Pathology of the university, Wike gave full scholarship to all the 55 students already admitted into the college of Medical Sciences of the institution.\n\nHe said the scholarship would last the entire period of the programme.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lawyers groan as JUSUN strike lingers on\n\nHe also directed the management of the institution to refund all fees paid already by the students, and forward their details to his office for computation.\n\nWike mandated the university to commence construction work on the building to house the School of Nursing within the premises of the Faculty of Medical Sciences.\n\nThe governor recalled that the previous administration once received in a month N100bn from the federation account, but frittered it away on elephant projects like the abandoned Monorail and non-existing Justice Karibi Whyte hospital.\n\nHe said the state allocation under his administration had never exceeded N13bn per month adding that despite the shortfall, he had within his second term awarded contracts for 10 flyovers in Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor local government areas\n\nSenator George Sekibo, who inaugurated the Senate building, commended Wike for his giant developmental stride in the state.\n\nHe explained that the governor had continued to take the lead in project implementation and would leave an indelible mark on the governance of the state.\n\nNigeria Medical Association President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, who laid the foundation for the Faculty of Basic Clinical, Clinical Science and Pathology buildings, observed that under Wike\u2019s administration the health sector had received unprecedented attention geared toward the sustainable development goals.",

          "text": "Twitter Suspension: Editors Urge FG To Seek Legitimate Means\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria and seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) respectively, the NGE said that the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\nAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said that the action is an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violates the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week.\n\n\u2018\u2019If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u2019\u2019, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying this ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u2018\u2019Certainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u2019\u2019, the Guild said,\n\nThe Guild therefore called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThousands of Twitter users in Nigeria are currently gnashing their teeth following the total enforcement of the ban of the micro-blogging app by telecom companies as directed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on Friday.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Mr Lai Mohammed, had on Friday announced the federal government\u2019s plans to indefinitely suspend Twitter after it deleted two tweets of President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its Community Standards.\n\nBarely a few hours after the Minister announced the planned suspension, it immediately backed it with a directive to the NCC, who in turn ordered that telcos comply immediately.\n\nThe development has continued to elicit reactions across Nigeria and abroad, with many describing the move as draconian and undemocratic.\n\nAnalysts who weighed in on the matter said there was no justification for the ban, especially since it has become a source of livelihood for thousands of Nigerians and a reliable news dissemination platform.\n\nCommenting on the development, a seasoned lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Mike Ozhekome, condemned the ban, saying that Twitter was one of the few places where Nigerians could freely express their grievances.\n\n\u2018Well, I am not surprised that the Federal Government has suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria. Are you? I have always said that this Government has a very thin skin for criticism. It is a government that cannot take punches, but delights in always giving punches to adversaries, real or imaginary,\u2019 the lawyer said.\n\n\u2018The government knows that Nigerians now express their resentment and protest through Twitter, by telling the whole world how Nigeria has been turned into a corruption haven, and a sprawling field of butchery, extra-judicial executions and slaughtering.\n\n\u2018Those in government do not want the world to hear about their atrocities. So, they just gleefully tell the world that they have suspended Twitter and that they would soon license other OTT and social media operations.\u2019\n\nOyo State Governor Seyi Makinde urged the federal government to reverse the ban, saying the microblogging and social networking platform has become a source of livelihood for many Nigerians.\n\nFormer Vice President of Nigeria Atiku Abubakar, who tweeted a few minutes after the suspension was announced on Friday, expressed shock at the development, adding: \u2018Hopefully, this won\u2019t be my last tweet.\u2019\n\nMany young Nigerians use Twitter to market their products, advertise their skills and source information. More so, Ministries, Departments and Agencies have lately deepened the use of Twitter to disseminate information, having found it effective and cost-saving.\n\nMany subscribers who commented on the government\u2019s decision condemned the Presidency for being too high-handed, comparing President Buhari to former US President Trump who was banned from all social media platforms and yet did not indefinitely suspend the big tech companies.\n\nSamuel Ola said: \u2018The fact they really did this is worrisome. Now it is Twitter. Only God knows what next if we don\u2019t stand strongly against this. I am an influencer on Twitter and I make my money from promoting products and brands on the platform. This is like taking away my source of income because I already have a huge following and this could affect that.\u2019\n\nSome have, however, suggested a number of ways Twitter users can bypass the restriction.\n\n\u2018If your Twitter account is blocked in Nigeria, go to Google Playstore and download \u201cWindscribe VPN\u201d. Set your location to another country. You will be accessing your Twitter account seamlessly. We get sense pass them,\u2019 said user @Tundegold.\n\nTwitter in its latest update has promised to restore access to the microblogging app for Nigerians.\n\n\u2018We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free #openinInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world,\u2019 it said.",

Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d Buhari wrote in the now-deleted tweet, referring to the brutal two-year Nigeria-Biafra war, which killed an estimated one to three million people, mostly from the Igbo tribe in the eastern part of the country between 1967-1970.\n\nThe tweet was deleted Wednesday after many Nigerians flagged it to Twitter and the platform said it had violated its policy on abusive behavior.\n\nInformation Minister Lai Mohammed criticized Twitter\u2019s action and accused the social media giant of \u201cdouble standards.\u201d\n\nMohammed also questioned Twitter\u2019s motives in Nigeria, saying, \u201cthe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect\u2026\u201d at a news conference on Wednesday after Buhari\u2019s tweet was deleted.\n\nTwitter said in a statement that it is \u201cdeeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to the free and #OpenInternet is an essential human right in modern society.

We want that board to be constituted, the ultimatum stands. After the ultimatum and nothing is done, don\u2019t blame anybody.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier Akpabio made reference to how war would break out in the Niger Delta if tension continues to grow.\n\nHe said that it was necessary for the youths to give peace a chance going by the fragile nature of the Niger Delta region, saying that \u201cwe must not allow our region to boil. We must support the Federal Government, particularly this present government.\u201d\n\nHe said his visit was primarily to consult the people on the way forward and also to appeal for peace.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that the minister left the peace parley at Oporoza with the promise to commence the process of constituting the substantive NDDC board on returning to Abuja.",

The Federal Government had Friday suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service site in Nigeria, citing the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nTwitter ban was announced by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, two days after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet posted Tuesday wherein he threatened to deal with secessionists \u201cin the language they understand\u201d.\n\nThe social media giant had said the tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\n\nThe President had released series of tweets after meeting with the Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, at the State House in Abuja on Tuesday, wherein he warned that those promoting insurrection and those sponsoring destruction of critical national assets would soon have the shock of their lives.\n\nHe also threatened to deal with \u201cthose misbehaving today\u201d \u201cin the language they understand.\u201d\n\nShortly after the order to suspend Twitter was announced by the federal government, FaceBook, another social media platform, deleted the same post from its platform.

          "text": "\u2022Experts doubt ability to enforce order\n\n\u2022Twitter says \u2018suspension deeply concerning\u2019\n\n\u2022NBC now to license social media\n\n\u2022Nigerian Tweeps prepare to use Virtual Private Networks\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nIn a shocking overreaction, the federal government yesterday announced the suspension of the operations of micro-blogging platform/social networking service provider, Twitter, in the country.\n\nThis was apparently in response to Twitter\u2019s deletion of a \u201ccivil war\u201d post by President Muhammadu Buhari, which the social media platform said violated its policies.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter, popularly among Nigerians, sent shock across the country, with many describing the action as illegal and an infringement on their freedom of expression.\n\nOwners of the micro-blogging platform also reacted, saying the suspension is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nBut experts punched holes in federal government\u2019s ability to enforce the suspension of Twitter and deny Nigerians access to the platform, given the availability of other options of accessing the micro-blog, like using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), geo-location changes and other technologies.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, in a statement signed by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi, said the measure against Twitter \u201cis with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe announcement by the Information Minister cited the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018FG Suspends Twitter\u2019s Operations in Nigeria\u2019, read: \u201cThe Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the press statement, Lai Mohammed also announced that the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) would immediately commence the process of licensing all social media operations in Nigeria. The NBC is the regulator of all radio and television stations in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, as at press time, Twitter was still up in Nigeria, as users still had access to the platform.\n\nPresident Buhari had condemned the attacks on police stations, prisons and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, especially in the South-East, warning that those supporting insurrection and violence in the country would be shocked.\n\nBuhari had tweeted, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet riled some persons who felt he was insensitive to have made an analogy of the civil war. His critics subsequently reported the tweet to Twitter and the microblogging site later deleted the post with a comment, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said yesterday that Twitter was not unfair to Buhari as being claimed, \u201cbecause a second Tweet by the Nigerian President that said almost the same thing as the \u2018civil war\u2019 Tweet was not deleted.\u201d\n\nDisapprovals Trail Suspension\n\nThe former vice president and PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar said in his verified twitter handle that the Twitter ban would not affect him.\n\nAtiku said in a single tweet: \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile\u201d\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki remarked: \u201cNo sir, this should not be the response from the President of a nation with a vibrant youthful population for whom the #Twitter is part of their daily lives and a source of their income and livelihood. This must be reviewed.\u201d\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vehemently rejected the Twitter suspension, describing it as a draconian action and a slide towards a fascist regime in our country.\n\nThe party asserted that the suspension \u201cis a vexatious, condemnable and barbaric move to muzzle Nigerians, particularly the youth, ostensibly to prevent them from holding the overtly corrupt, vindictive and divisive Buhari administration accountable for its atrocities, including human right violations, patronising of terrorists and outright suppressive acts against innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by their National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said, \u201cOur party is appalled that the Federal Government could exhibit such primitive intolerance and power intoxication because the social media giant demonstrated international best practices in not allowing the Buhari presidency to use Twitter as a platform to propagate and spread the Buhari administration\u2019s hatred towards Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCivil society organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) vowed to sue the federal government over its suspension of Twitter.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, SERAP said, \u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information, including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. Nigeria, we\u2019ll see in court.\u201d\n\nThe British embassy in Nigeria also condemned the Twitter suspension.\n\nAccording to the British Deputy High Commissioner in Abuja, Gill Atkinson, the federal government must not suppress basic freedom as all Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech.\n\nTweeting from @GillAtkinson11, she said: \u201cAll Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech and the responsibility not to misuse that right. Any action taken by Government must be measured, proportionate and not suppress basic freedoms.\u201d\n\nHer tweet was liked by the Twitter handles of @UKinNigeria and Paul Arkwright, the former UK diplomat to Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association threatened to challenge the twitter suspension in court.\n\nNBA President, Olumide Akpata, described the decision as illegal.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a\n\nconstitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; and government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and deprive Nigerians of their right to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling, the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the Nigerian Bar Association will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and our democracy.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said the decision to suspend Twitter shows that Buhari has suspended Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe human rights lawyer argued that the suspension is also at variance with the Freedom of Information Act which seeks to expand information and access to it.\n\nNobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka described Twitter suspension as unbecoming of a democratically elected President.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Laureate, if Buhari has a problem with the micro-blogging platform, he should sort it out between them personally, the way ex-US president Donald Trump did and not rope in the right to free expression of the Nigerian citizen as collateral damage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cIn any case, this is a technical problem. Nigerians should be able to work their way around. The field of free expression remains wide open, free of any dictatorial spasms!\u201d\n\nTweeps Prepare to Use Virtual Private Networks\n\nNigerian tweeps are already contemplating using Virtual Private Networks to have access to Twitter, as soon as the suspension of the social media platform\u2019s operation in Nigeria takes off.\n\nFor most of yesterday, Nigerians on Twitter expressed their displeasure at the federal government\u2019s ban and were suggesting alternative ways to continue the use of the platform.\n\nOne @itzbasito said, \u201cFG have suspended twitter in Nigeria, Please suggest some free VPNs you know jare, let\u2019s help ourselves.\u201d\n\n@UPGodwin shared a \u201clist of VPNs to download while Federal Government Suspension of Twitter in Nigeria lasts: 1. Windscribe 2. USA VPN 3. Nord 4. PIA 5. IPvanish.\u201d\n\n@FestusGreen said, \u201cMinister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has just announced the indefinite ban of Twitter in Nigeria. This ban/suspension can\u2019t be challenged in Court, because the courts are on strike. They\u2019d earlier banned security and development. Can they ban VPNs, and dozens others?\u201d\n\nPolitical activist, Deji Adeyanju said, \u201cBuhari has added another tyranny achievement to his record: Twitter suspension in Nigeria. Unrepentant tyrant.\u201d\n\nIn another post, he said, \u201cNo shaking I have VPN.\u201d\n\nTwitters\u2019 Reaction\n\nMicro-blogging site, Twitter, says the suspension of its operations in Nigeria is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nTwitter\u2019s Senior Policy Communications Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Sarah Hart, stated this yesterday night.\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more,\u201d Hart said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari, Biafra And Twitter, By Ozodinukwe Okenwa",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari as a \"kind bully\" (apology to Femi Adesina) has bared his dictatorial fangs recently by banning or suspending indefinitely the operations of the popular global microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria. Nigeria, contrary to what Adesina, the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, believes, does not need the combination of General Buhari and\n\nPresident Buhari. Whether as a General or President Buhari has proven himself to be a failure.\n\n\n\nAccording to the shocking statement emanating from the office of the Minister of Information and Culture the Federal Government cited \"persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence\" as a basis to shut out permanently Twitter. Twitter enjoys a large following in Nigeria given the mobile young generation the country boasts of.\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\nBesides, the statement equally \"directed the National Broadcasting Commission to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria\". Whatever that meant but suffice to say here that Nigeria has scored another low in the eyes of the civilized world. If this directive did not violate Sections 22 and 39 of the 1999 Constitution then trouble lies ahead.\n\nDays prior to the extreme decision primarily aimed at stifling freedom of expression the embattled President had incurred the wrath of the American social media giant following a reckless 'genocidal' comments he posted on its platform. He was openly threatening those clamouring for self-governance or glorified secessionists.\n\nBuhari had gracelessly reminded them of the Biafran war and how those of them that fought in it went through hell for three years to keep the nation one. Following complaints by some concerned Nigerians, at home and abroad, who read connotations into the ominous outburst the Twitter management acted swiftly by taking down the offensive tweet.\n\nEven the megalomaniacal former President of the United States, Donald Trump, had suffered worse fate following the storming of the Capitol in January by his partisan followers as Congress was in full session to validate the controversial victory of President Joe Biden in last year November's presidential poll. Trump was banned indefinitely from using and abusing Twitter to foster his political ambition.\n\nAnd just recently breaking news had it that Facebook had moved against Trump banning him from using the platform for two years. Censoring Trump (then) and Buhari now could be said to be in order. The 'genocidal' tweet in question violated Twitter's regulations. No leader should be allowed to use Twitter to incite a mob or threaten his people no matter the circumstances.\n\nIf there is justice and equity in Nigeria then Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho would not have been thrown up to champion the cause of their respective peoples. If Buhari leads responsibly by being fair and just to every region, religion and ethnic group then no one should be complaining of marginalisation or inequity. If Nigeria is working for all of us then the Igbos and Yorubas would not want to go their seperate ways.\n\nTwitter is no respecter of personalities. It respects and encourages freedom of expression and the concomitant fertilisation of ideas in its best tradition and standard. But it applies sanctions whenever necessary.\n\nBy reaching the draconian abhorrent decision to ban Twitter from our national space Buhari has demonstrated yet again his primitiveness and lawlessness. With that we are faced with a creeping loading dictatorship that could culminate in the shrinking of the social media space, gagging of the independent press and criminalisation of free speech. We must resist this with determination!\n\nBuhari has never hidden his disdain for the media or free speech. Taciturn and reclusive in a civilised digital age this dictator from Daura has continued to be a source of embarrassment to Nigeria. Apart from setting the federal house of commotion he met on fire he is now trying to use coercion to put down every agitation for a better society.\n\nRecently a secret memo surfaced online in which the corrupt Attorney-General of the (Fulani) Federation (AGF), and Minister of (In)Justice, Abubakar Malami, was advocating strongly for his principal to impose a state of emergency in order to crush the opposition. He urged Buhari to suspend Nigeria's Constitution and enforce martial law citing Chapter IV of the Constitution.\n\nWe are now confronted with a throwback to the dark days of the Jackboot. All values hitherto held dear are under assault. The days, weeks and months ahead could be a defining or redifining moments in our tortured trajectory as a nation-state. We shall survive Buharism as we survived Babangidaism. And the gory era of the late despotic madman from Kano, Sani Abacha.\n\nThere is tension everywhere. And the President does not have what it takes to take the nation back from the brink. In the south-east there is an undeclared Biafran war being waged on the fringes. The so-called unknown gunmen are running berserk attacking critical federal institutions and facilities.\n\nAnd to deal with the violence and terrorism the Buhari administration has gone for broke intimidating and molesting the innocent. Folks are being dehumanized, framed up as ESN operatives and arrested and thrown into gulags. Even churches are not spared of the brutal clampdown.\n\nSomewhere in Enugu state recently some church attendants were marched out of the church by heavily-armed security forces and taken to unknown destination. They were accused falsely of belonging to IPOB or being ESN agents! It is now dangerous to be a young man in the east. Most people live dangerously as war looms in the horizon.\n\nBiafra could be said to be an oriental 'paradise', our 'paradise'! A land metaphorically flowing with milk and honey; a blessed land where natural resources are in abundance; a land of the rising sun inhabited by great enterprising souls. Yet there is trouble in this 'paradise' presently. But whether it is now a 'paradise' lost is left in the womb of time and circumstances.\n\nUpon realisation, however, this 'paradise' could rival Dubai, Hong Kong and Japan in terms of economic and infrastructural greatness. Could this be the reason for its delay? The will is there, the power is there, the human resources are there and the sophistication is there. Above all, God is there in the detail!\n\nBiafra, as an idea whose time has come, ought to be realised by negotiation and referendum rather than war. The late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu tried war but failed. Yet nothing proves that fifty years after, if he were to be alive and undertook that horrible path again, success would not be his.\n\nHowever, in our reckoning war cannot solve the problem but would make things worse. Let reason prevail!\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\n[email protected]",

          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "title": "5 Reasons Why You Should Consider A Loan from Page Financials",
          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase. You will be required to provide these details to help us to verify your identity and financial standing.\n\nLoan Requirements for Private Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a private sector employee, it is required that:\n\nYou earn a monthly salary (minimum 150k monthly) You have up to 6-months\u2019 salary account statement You live/work in Lagos or Ibadan (bankers nationwide can apply) You have a valid work ID from where you work or an evidence of employment or promotion You have a BVN that is actively connected to your working mobile number\n\nSome of the items above will be retrieved automatically when you begin the application, it usually takes customers less than 3 minutes to complete the application if they have the requirements ready.\n\nTo apply as a private sector employee click here\n\nLoan Requirements for Public Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a Federal Government Civil Servant, it is required that:\n\nYou have your work ID You have a valid Government issued ID You have at least 3 months\u2019 payslips You will present a signed letter of authority to debit (the letter is available for download on our website)\n\nTo apply as a public sector employee, click here\n\nReasons to Avoid a Personal Loan\n\nWhile personal loans can be a saving grace in times of great need, there are some instances you should avoid borrowing money. Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nHe also disclosed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations.\n\nThe move has understandably drawn outrage from Nigerians who see it as yet another attack on free speech by the government. However, free speech is not the only thing affected.\n\nThe Twitter ban would also affect the country\u2019s economy. Consequently, investor confidence would weaken, and there\u2019d be a negative impact on development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 World Bank study found a correlation between increased broadband penetration and an increase in per capita GDP.\n\nIn addition, Internet or social media shutdowns cost sub-Saharan countries $237.4 million in 2020.\n\nWe examine how this ban affects the economy of the country below.\n\nInfluencers\n\nOver the past few years, the influencer marketing space in Nigeria has grown so much that almost anyone with dedicated followers could snag deals with organisations looking to extend their reach.\n\nThough some influencers \u2014 mostly lifestyle \u2014 use Instagram more, Twitter is the primary platform for most of them.\n\nWhile the organisations that work with them can easily use other channels for their marketing activities, it would be harder for them to do the same.\n\nAlso, while they may be able to afford VPN services, their followers who keep them in business may be unable or reluctant to do so. Either way, this does not end well for these influencers.\n\nFreelancers\n\nThe increase in Internet penetration has increased the number of people making a living off the Internet, specifically social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom social media managers to content creators and product photographers, thousands of Nigerians have created careers off these platforms. This ban puts their sources of livelihood at risk.\n\nIn a previous article, we examined how Nigerians are now using Twitter to get jobs, investors, and fill vacancies. These are all activities that a social media ban would hinder.\n\nStartups\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, with $3,77.4 million raised in 2019, although that figure fell to $120.6 million in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis has resulted in jobs for a significant number of people and revenue in the form of taxes for the government.\n\nHowever, this ban puts all of that at risk. For most startups, their businesses depend, in some part, on social media.\n\nWithout access to social media to run marketing campaigns or build relationships with their customers, business would take a hit. Applications that are built using Twitter APIs are also affected.\n\nWhat did these humans do fgs? Block twitter and thereby blocking every other domain that has twitters apis embedded in it? React native elements, UI kitten, my components libraries are not working. I can\u2019t do my work. Wth is wrong with this country! \u2014 Mazi Juls (@AAjulibe) June 5, 2021\n\nWhile these businesses would find ways to innovate around the ban, their users may not.\n\nYou now have to add \u201chow would navigate a government ban\u201d to the type of questions you might have to answer when fundraising. \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) June 4, 2021\n\nPolitical stability is one of the factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. By banning Twitter and directing the NBC to start licensing OTT services in the country, investors are not likely to jump at the opportunity of investing in Nigerian startups depriving the country of much-needed investments.\n\nMerchants\n\nSmall and medium enterprises are vital to the growth of any economy, frequently providing as much as 60-70% of the economy with jobs. Numbering about 117.4 million, SMEs in Nigeria contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses, and 84% of employment.\n\nMany SMEs have leveraged the Internet, especially social media, for business activities such as marketing and customer service. The number of vendors on Twitter and Instagram is a testament to this.\n\nWhile these businesses could move to other platforms, their posts might not gain as much engagement as Twitter provides. What\u2019s more? There are no assurances that a ban on other social media platforms would not follow.",

Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you <a href=\" \"> subscribe now </a>.\n\nGood day.\n\nBolu here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s multi-device support\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s Tesla\n\nTwitter launching Twitter Blue\n\nOne WhatsApp account, multiple devices\n\nInstant messaging app, WhatsApp, will soon allow users to simultaneously open one account across several devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat took so long? Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity. But some local entrepreneurs have not only actualised this but incorporated the continent\u2019s flair.\n\nFrom electric delivery tricycles used by Kibanda to Siltech\u2019s electric bikes and Jet Motor Company\u2019s cars, an African Tesla could be closer than we think.\n\nTechpoint Africa visited Tolulope Williams, a legal practitioner turned EV engineer, and he detailed his story on how a love for motorbikes gave birth to an EV assembly company.\n\nRead his engaging discussion with our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter launches premium subscription service\n\nTwitter launched its premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, on June 3, 2021. According to the company\u2019s blog, the service is geared towards frequent users who desire a better experience on the platform.\n\nThe service provides \u201caccess to exclusive features and perks that will take their experience on Twitter to the next level.\u201d\n\nTwitter will roll out the payment service in Australia and Canada to get feedback, and users who subscribe to the service will get features such as Undo Tweet, Bookmark Folders, and Reader Mode.\n\nHow much will it cost? While Twitter didn\u2019t mention a cost, my story about the coming of Twitter Blue might give you an idea.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nTwitter launches Birdwatch to combat misinformation.

          "text": "No citizen of an African country made the list of 106 richest millennial billionaires in the world, analysis of the latest data on millennial billionaires published by Visual Capitalist shows.\n\nVisual Capitalist, which used data from Forbes, said, \u201cOf these ultra-wealthy individuals, just over 100 are millennials, born between the years 1981 and 1996. This young generation represents around 3.8% of all billionaires on a global basis.\u201d\n\nAfrica, whose countries have a combined gross domestic product to the tune of $2.6 trillion, is home to 1.31 billion individuals spread across 54 countries. From the list, no single individual among the youngest generation of billionaires worldwide is from Africa.\n\nNot that the entire continent is that poor, because some of the countries that produced these millennial billionaires are not as big as some African countries when ranked by GDP.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong, Ireland, Denmark, Singapore and Colombia have their citizens on the list, but by gross domestic product, they are not as big as Nigeria and South Africa ranked by Worldometers as the 30th and 32nd biggest countries in the world.\n\n\u201cIt is basically about the environment and African countries have similar characteristics. It is about our education system, security, regulatory bodies, and leadership, among others,\u201d said Tomi Wale, creative director, Getupinc, a millennial-centric organisation.\n\n\u201cIf you plant a seed in the appropriate soil, it will sprout and blossom. That soil is not in Africa, particularly Nigeria. Due to the frustrating environment, Nigerian millennials have now made Canada their home,\u201d Wale said.\n\nRead Also: A financial operating system built for Africa by Africans is Appzone\u2019s vision- Emetarom\n\nThe 106 millennial billionaires have a combined wealth of $573.1 billion, with a median age of 35.6 years, and 71.6 percent of this wealth is concentrated in the United States of America and China. The youngest among them is Alexandra Andresen, a Norwegian, aged 24 years and worth $1.4 billion, whose investment interest is in diversified businesses, while the oldest are David Chen, a Singaporean worth $2.4 billion, who has interest in media and entertainment, and Paul Sciarra, an American worth $2.9 billion, who has interest in technology. Both Chen and Sciarra are each aged 40 years old.\n\nBy producing 33 millennial billionaires, the US accounts for $266.7 billion of the youngest billionaires\u2019 wealth, representing 46.5 percent of the total 106 millennial billionaires\u2019 wealth. China produces 22, with a combined wealth of $143.8 billion, representing 25.1 percent of the total wealth controlled by the individuals under study. The United States also has an edge over China in the sense that US millennial billionaires\u2019 average age is 35.6 years while China\u2019s is 36.9 years old.\n\nGermany produces eight millennial billionaires with a combined wealth of $11.7 billion, which represents 2 percent of the total wealth. Their average age is 35.1 years.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Sweden have five millennial billionaires each. The combined wealth of the youngest billionaires from Brazil is $24.7 billion, representing 4.3 percent of the total wealth. The five youngest billionaires from Russia control 6.4 percent of the total wealth which amounts to $36.8 billion, while Sweden\u2019s five millennial billionaires control 2.4 percent of the total wealth of the 106 millennial billionaires, amounting to $13.9 billion.\n\nBrazil\u2019s average age is 35.4 years old; Russia\u2019s average age is 35 years, while those from Sweden are aged 38 years on average.\n\nHong Kong and Norway have four millennial billionaires each, with a combined wealth of $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion, as well as an average age of 34.3 years and 28.3 years, respectively.\n\nAustralia, Canada, Denmark and India have three millennial billionaires each. With a median age of 33 years, the combined wealth of those from Australia is $5.2 billion, representing 0.9 percent of the total wealth. Canada\u2019s millennial billionaires have a median age of 36 years, with combined wealth of $6.8 billion, which amounts to 1.2 percent of the total wealth.\n\nDenmark\u2019s millennial billionaires made their fortunes from manufacturing, fashion and retail. With a median age of 34 years, their combined wealth is $11.3 billion, representing 2 percent of the total wealth.\n\nIndia\u2019s millennial billionaires are worth $4.8 billion, which represents 0.8 percent of the total wealth of the 106 millennial billionaires worldwide. Their median age is 38.7 years.\n\nIreland has two millennial billionaires with a combined worth of $6.4 billion, which represents 1.1 percent of the total wealth. Others such as Colombia, Finland, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom have one each.\n\nBy economic sectors, 34 of the 106 millennial billionaires made their wealth from technology, 15 from finance and investments, 10 from media and entertainment, eight from automotive, seven from fashion and retail, six each from diversified sectors, healthcare, and manufacturing, five from real estate, three from metals and mining, and two each from food and beverages, energy, and services.",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr. Stella Obehi Ojeme said it was the right of every child to be protected.\n\nHe listed the types of Child Abuse to include Physical, Emotional and Sexual Abuses, asserting that abusing a child constituted the worst thing anybody could do to a child.\n\n\u201d It is the right of children to be protected. When you protect children, you are not doing them a favour. It is the duty of everyone to protect children because we are all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cNot putting a child in school is another form of child abuse. Every child deserve to be well treated. Discrimination against children is yet another form of abuse\u201d, she said.\n\nParticipants at the event were secondary students from the five local government areas of Edo Central Senatorial Districts, parents, teachers, security agents, civil society groups, among others.\n\n...",

This suspension, which is a reaction of the Nigerian government to the company\u2019s enforcement of its platform rules, is aimed at insulating the government from criticism, especially by Nigeria\u2019s youth who are over 70% of the country\u2019s population,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that Nigeria\u2019s President has notably been insulated from every form of public accountability. He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\n\n\u201cA 2016 United Nations resolution affirms that the rights that citizens have offline must apply online. Coincidentally, this resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria with others. We urge the Nigerian authorities to respect and enforce citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as provided for by the Nigerian constitution and International human rights treaties that Nigeria is a party to.\n\n\u201cWe will further contact the Ministry of Information to get exact details of this announcement, and the legal framework that supports such undemocratic pronouncement. We advise all users of twitter and other social media platforms in Nigeria to download virtual private networks (VPNs) to enable them continue to use the platforms for their economic survival and social and political engagements while we all push back on this draconian order by the Nigerian government.\u201d",

          "text": "The challenges hitherto experienced by Importers and exporters at the nation\u2019s ports and borders may soon become a thing of the past as the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control NAFDAC and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation GATF have commenced putting together strategies aimed at achieving standardization and harmonization of documents for export and import trade with a view to simplifying trade formalities and procedures and ultimately ensuring ease of doing business in Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye at a virtual meeting with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria top officials led by its Project Lead, Mr. Bernard Traynor.\n\nThe project is being powered by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. It\u2019s an organization that is being hosted by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum. The project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ. The alliance is supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\nIn a statement by NAFDAC Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola on Friday, June 4, 2021, Prof Adeyeye who was represented by Dr Abimbola Adegboye, Head of Trade and International Relations at the Agency reiterated measures that NAFDAC has already put in place to ensure that there\u2019s a seamless and more robust operational procedure with both export and import at the borders; and achieve cooperation amongst government agencies at the borders.\n\nShe said NAFDACs focus now is to ensure smooth trade facilitation and regulation, stressing that operations of regulators should not pose an hinderance to trade transactions but facilitate them. \u2019\u2019We are focused on making sure that there are not so many interferences between the users of our facilities and ourselves. So, we try as much as possible to remove both human interferences under the guise of consultants. Because more or less they do not facilitate trade. They tend to distort it\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to Prof. Adeyeye, trade should be on basis of safety and quality, noting that, that is the only way trade could be sustained. \u2018\u2019If quality is not put into your product, It gives the country a bad name. They blacklist the company involved. The consumers are the losers because they do not have value for money and their health is compromised\u2019\u2019.\n\nShe noted that these are the issues that the global alliance is trying to address, adding that \u2018\u2019what will make all these visible and possible is to ensure that operations at the borders are seamless.\n\nIf you have perishable items that are to be exported or that are to be allowed into the country and they are delayed unnecessarily, and they are not held at premium conditions such products could go bad, and quality and the integrity of such product would be compromised leading to health issues with the end-users.\n\nAnything that would make trade operations very easy both for inflow and outflow, that would make the whole process of regulation friendly, we are all for it\u2019\u2019.\n\nIn other not to make the whole process too cumbersome for exporters and importers, she stated that for ease of doing business the agency has ensured that all NAFDAC import licenses consisting of approvals, import and export permits have been made in electronic format which can be verified on the NAFDAC single window for trade portal. \u2018\u2019The import of this is that there is no need for any scanned documents when an importer needs to process form \u2018M\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his submission, the Project Manager of Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria. Mr. David Okeku, the title for the project is Standardization and Harmonization of Trade formalities and procedures in Nigeria. He disclosed that his organization is being powered by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum.\n\nHe further explained that the project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ and supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019Being an alliance, we also have critical private sector partners,. which we work with: BLM, BSM, DHL, Mascline, UPS and WALMART. On a global scale, we have series of projects which we are currently implementing in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia, Senegal, Uganda and Latin America, Asia and middle East countries\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019How we work in the alliance is that we partner with multinationals, local businesses because we believe strongly that they will bring in their expertise and also best practices; and also bring in supply-chain companies. We use them as our ambassadors globally and in-country. Local businesses also contribute in form of expertise and resources in kind towards the alliance\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Nigeria, he said the on-going project, Harmonization and Simplifying Trade Formalities and Procedures in Nigeria, seeks to support implementing three articles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. \u2018\u2019This speaks to article 10.1 which borders around formalities and documentary requirements, article 8 which talks about border agencies cooperation and article 2.2 which talks on consultation.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the aim of the project is to simplify, standardize and harmonize export and import formalities and trade procedures in Nigeria, adding that it also aims at reducing the average release time and the associated costs, its documentary requirements and border compliance for exports and imports.\n\nHe further explained that the scope of the project is capacity building for border agencies, e.g., NAFDAC, Customs, SON, Quarantine, and other agencies on the ground. \u2018We are also working clearly on defining export data, documents and processes for the Nigeria Customs service, and other partner agencies.\n\nFor now, he said the project is focusing on the Cargo operations in Lagos, after which \u2018\u2019we would then take the lessons learnt and scale it up to Sea cargo operations subsequently\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our partners on the ground are the Nigeria Customs Service, FMITI and border agencies like NAFDAC, SON, NDLEA, FAAN while on the side of the private sector, we have the International Chamber of Commerce, Nigeria, MAN, LCCI, the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, the Nigeria Private sector alliance, and the Organization for Women in Internal Trade. Private sector companies like DHL, UPS, MARZK are our partners on the ground\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nMr. Okeku said his organization had conducted a gender study to identify gender specific bottlenecks on air cargo trade, adding that \u2018\u2019We also worked out or defined mainstreaming approaches and series of targeted actives which are currently being incorporated into our work plan\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019In February we realized a memorandum of understanding with the Nigeria Customs as a lead agency for border operations in Nigeria. We had series of capacity buildings for the customs service with trade facilitation related topics. Last month we had an executive master class for the management of the Nigeria Customs Service on trade facilitation agreement issues in Nigeria\u2019\u2019.\n\nGoing forward, he said a policy steering group at the headquarters level which will be chaired by the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment and the NCS would be set up with a similar group at the operational level on the ground at the Lagos Airport.\n\nHe said a baseline assessment at the Lagos airport would be conducted and agreed with stakeholders on target model and workplan. For the policy steering group and operational steering group, \u2018\u2019we would need a representation at the headquarters level that would be giving the management direct feedback\u2019\u2019, adding that the policy steering group would cut across all other agencies and private sector key partners. \u2018\u2019It would be in form of high-level group in Abuja for policy and decision-making purposes\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the operational purposes in Lagos, he said there would be the operational group consisting of the clearing agents on the ground. \u2018\u2019NAFDAC\u2019s representative at the Airport with the key IT division would be representing NAFDAC at the Airport committee level\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are having these two approaches for the purpose of fast-tracking our work and for ease of flow of information between the agencies. It\u2019s also a way of enforcing inter-agency cooperation and collaboration both at the high level in Abuja and on the ground in Lagos\u2019\u2019, he said, stressing that \u2018\u2019We strongly believe that this approach will help us in implementing our projects and ultimately help Nigeria achieve the three articles which we are looking at in helping Nigeria implement in Lagos\u2019\u2019.",

          "title": "OPINION: Why Twitter Ban Is Disastrous For Nigeria",
          "text": "Yesterday the federal government of Nigeria released a statement via its official Twitter handle of the ministry of information and culture, banning all Twitter service operations in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as \u201ctweets\u201d. Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them.\n\nThis ban invariably means that Twitter services will no longer be accessible directly on the internet via any Nigeria Internet Service Provider.\n\nThe ban is to mandate all Internet Service Providers in Nigeria to prevent its internet users from accessing Twitter services either via the regular web or mobile application. So users who are connected to the internet will remain connected and will be able to access other social media or social networking sites except for access to Twitter services.\n\nWhile this may sound to be a major milestone for the federal government since it has been looking for ways to regulate social media, it is also a very terrible decision because it is an awareness of a new dimension of anonymity, crime & catastrophic disaster that has the capacity to cripple the economy even more than it is already.\n\nEven countries like China and Iran that have effected such a ban have not been able to restrict access completely and the reason is that there are technologies that enable bypass of any IP restriction.\n\nFor the federal government to effect this ban, Internet Service Providers will need to identify and blacklist all IP addresses that belong to Twitter. Once this is done, no one should be able to access Twitter again directly from their phones, or laptops. However, this blacklist can be bypassed using Virtual Private Network Technology or even a TOR Browser.\n\nA Virtual Private Network, generally known as VPN, is a technology that enables users to connect and communicate with a server at another location usually in another country different from the user\u2019s country, using an encrypted connection. Once the connection is established, the VPN technology enables the user to make use of the IP address of the server it is connected with to request any web or mobile application, which in turn is sent to the user\u2019s devices via the VPN connection that is highly encrypted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow the federal government would not know the content of the reply because it is encrypted with a strong encryption algorithm.\n\nThe reason I said this ban will be disastrous to Nigeria is that it will automatically create a level of VPN awareness which users of the Nigeria Twitter community and by extension, the Nigeria internet community would begin to explore, which will make the job of the law enforcement agencies more difficult as it may be difficult to trace IP addresses used for cyber-related crimes.\n\nWhen citizens are brought to the knowledge of how VPN can effectively make them anonymous by masking their IP address while on the internet, it becomes a preference, even after the ban is lifted if it will be. This in turn will increase cybercrime rates.\n\nUsing a VPN connection to now access the internet will cripple corporate organizations that target internet users as their source of business clients. Most corporate organizations that engage in digital marketing for survival will no longer be able to effectively get their client via the internet community because VPN users will be using the IP address of another country to access the internet which includes their social media accounts. This will have a drastic effect on social media advertisements. It may end up shutting down companies and other small and medium enterprises because digital marketing advert will no longer be as effective as they used to be when there was no VPN.\n\nThe most dangerous effect of this ban is when internet users decide to access Twitter from a tor browser instead of a VPN or when internet users use a VPN alongside a tor-browser. This combination does not just bring anonymity, it also introduces the Nigerian internet community to the dark web.\n\nThe dark web is not a place the country should encourage citizens to begin to access because it cannot only corrupt the citizens, it can also empower citizens with information that internet users should never have been privileged to on regular internet access. It will not only be devastating for the Nigerian community to be introduced to the dark web activities, but it can also be disastrous!\n\nIt is never too late for a reversal!\n\nJafaru, is a Cyber Security Expert & Founder of HICS Academy.",

In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens,\u2019\u2019 the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media companies, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services,\u2019\u2019 the Guild said.\n\nThe Guild, therefore, called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.",

These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed.

Nigerians, however, have continued to tweet and engage on the microblogging site despite the threat.\n\nFollowing Malami\u2019s warning to arrest and punish anybody who uses Twitter in Nigeria, prominent preacher Enoch Adeboye, the general Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God and spiritual father of Vice President Yemi Osibanjo, turned to Twitter.\n\n\u201cNo retreat.

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Editors in Nigeria have called on the federal government to immediately reconsider the suspension of operations of Twitter as the move projects the Nigerian government as a dictatorship.\n\nThe editors under the aegis of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) described the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet and called on the Nigerian government to seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the microblogging company.\n\nThe Nigerian editors stated this in a statement on Saturday and noted that the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\n\u201cAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said that the action is an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violates the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform,\u201d the statement signed by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) read.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week.\n\n\u2018\u2019If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u2019\u2019, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying this ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u2018\u2019Certainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u2019\u2019, the Guild said,\n\nThe Guild therefore called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
