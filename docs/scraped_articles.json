          "text": "Nurses and healthcare workers attend a rally in front of Bellevue Hospital in New York on June 4, 2020. PHOTO: AFP\n\nBy Babajide Komolafe, Economy Editor\n\nOne in five workers says he is likely to switch to a new employer in the next 12 months, indicating that the ongoing widespread staff resignation across the world will persist for some time, said PwC in its global workforce survey.\n\nThe company in a report on the survey said: \u201cThe Great Resignation will continue apace in the year ahead as one in five workers says he is likely to switch to a new employer in the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cThat was a key finding from PwC\u2019s Global Workforce Hopes and Fears survey of 52,195 workers in 44 countries and territories \u2013 one of the largest ever surveys of the global workforce.\n\n\u201cThe survey finds that 35 per cent are planning to ask their employer for more money in the next 12 months. Pressure on pay is highest in the tech sector where 44 per cent of workers surveyed plan to ask for a raise and is lowest in the public sector (25 per cent).\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the survey shows that while an increase in pay is a main motivator for making a job change (71 per cent), wanting a fulfilling job (69 per cent) and wanting to truly be themselves at work (66 per cent) round out the top three things workers are looking for. Nearly half (47 per cent) prioritised being able to choose where they work. Workers who are likely to look for a new employer in the next 12 months are less likely to feel satisfied with their current employer.\n\nTo address this phenomenon, Olusola Adewole, Partner, People and Organisation Advisory Leader, PwC Nigeria, stressed the need for companies to create a great employee experience.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Nigeria, the Great Resignation is amplified by socio-political problems. People across all career levels are not just leaving their companies or industries, they are leaving the country.\n\n\u201dThere is a global competition for talent- nations are competing for talent. Organisations must think about its Purpose- in terms of the social dimensions of ESG.\n\n\u201dCompanies need to ask themselves if there is something they can do to create a great employee experience. We have an opportunity to move from the great resignation to exploiting the great opportunity. To do so, companies must reinvent their workforce strategy and build a HR function that is future ready.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Bob Moritz, Global Chairman of PwC, said: \u201cThere is a tremendous need for business to do more to improve the skills of workers, while being conscious of the risk of polarisation if opportunities to develop aren\u2019t provided right across society. At the same time, workers are not just looking for decent pay, they want more control over how they work and they want to derive greater meaning from what they do.\n\n\u201cThese are linked: by acquiring skills, workers can gain the control over the work they are looking for. Leaders have to adapt to build the teams needed to successfully deal with the challenges and opportunities of today and those yet to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe survey also found that 65% of workers discuss social and political issues with colleagues frequently or sometimes, with the number higher for younger workers (69 per cent) and ethnic minorities (73 per cent). While business leaders are sometimes nervous about people bringing these potentially polarising issues to work, the impact is net positive. 79 per cent of those who talk about social and political issues at work reported at least one positive consequence from that.\n\n\u201cWith political and social issues alive in the workplace, the job for employers is to create a context which secures the benefits of open conversation while minimising the negative impacts \u2013 41% reported a negative consequence of discussions about social issues. Both numbers were significantly higher for people who consider themselves part of an ethnic minority (84% positive and 59% negative),\u201d said PwC.",

This means putting our security above all else: no security, no country. Political will is the willingness and ability to take tough decisions to secure Nigeria.\u201c\n\nThe ADC presidential aspirant pledged to eliminate corruption by ensuring that Nigerian workers were paid better salaries and build modern cities with better amenities, world-class health facilities and accessible and affordable internet services across the country.\n\nIn a broadcast made last night via his social media platform, the ADC presidential front runner reminded the delegates how crucial the presidential ticket was, saying they had a huge opportunity this week to elect a candidate of the party who had the capacity to redirect the socio-political and economic focus of the country.\u201cHe promised to redirect the vast energies of youths to a productive venture like trading with their technical skills rather than engaging in online scams popularly called \u2018yahoo.\u2019\u201cHe said if elected President, he would collaborate with state governments to invest in power generation, build broadband internet infrastructure and limit states and the private sector to distribution activities only.\u201cKachikwu said: \u201cTogether we can design a new menu for our people. We will rebuild Nigeria from the ground up and do away with the faulty and archaic colonial foundation that now characterises our current existence.\u201c\u2018\u2019We must define our common charter as Nigerians and constitute a new nation that is not only inclusive for all but guarantees equal rights and expressions to all irrespective of tribe, tongue and religion.\u201c\u2018\u2019This new Nigeria must come first before any other identification. It will be our common bond as we do away with all colonial relics of division, mistrust and hatred.\n\n\u201cHe said government is and should be a big brother and not a big bully, adding that millions of the citizenry still live without light and potable water in the year 2022. This is unconscionable.\n\n\u201cI will have the political will to secure our country. This means putting our security above all else: no security, no country. Political will is the willingness and ability to take tough decisions to secure Nigeria, including not succumbing to or being deceived by vested interests that might be profiting from the killing field Nigeria has become.\u201c\u2018\u2019It also means putting Nigeria\u2019s security above ethnic or religious interests. It means loyalty to the lives of Nigerians and the territory of Nigeria first, no matter where within our country.\u201d",

He wondered why the wind would turn the clock anti clock wise when it was the southeasterners\u2019 turn.\n\nHe further said that the founding fathers of the nation maintained the tenets and principles of the regional system of North, East and West in the distribution of power-sharing and advised that the system, which is based on equity, fairness and accommodation, should be maintained.\n\nIwuanyanwu called on the various political parties in the country to keep faith with the zoning system in the election of the next President of Nigeria next year.\n\nHe said that at the end of the congresses, Nigerians will elect who amongst them is the best candidate. Iwuanyanwu, who had at several meetings and fora maintained that it is the turn of the southeast to produce the President of Nigeria in the 2023 election commended some patriotic Nigerians who have been supporting the clamour for a president of Igbo extraction.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the former President of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo; the leader of South-South Elders Forum, Chief Edwin Clark; the leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; the fiery Prelate Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, Alhaji Tanko Yakasi, and many others who have insisted that justice and equity should be maintained by allowing the southeast to produce the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\nChief Iwuanyanwu described these Nigerians as heroes of a new Nigeria, where justice, truth and equity will prevail as a supreme virtue.\n\nHe disagreed with those of the opinion that the southeast should wait for 2027, maintaining that the southeast should have its slot in 2023 while others should have theirs in 2027.",

The factors are: nationwide recognition, reach, structure, support, endorsements, mass appeal, track record as governor of Lagos State, rich experience in both the private and public sectors.\n\nTinubu, along with President Buhari, is a co-founder of the APC.\n\nHe has mentored politicians across the country, many of who became governors, senators, House of Representatives members, or were elected or appointed through his support.\n\nTinubu, as APC National Leader, has profound influence on the key structures of the party in many states.\n\nHe also has the backing of more governors than his rivals.\n\nWith governors having tremendous influence on the delegates \u2013 three per local government \u2013 Tinubu can feel confident about emerging his party\u2019s torch-bearer and a potential face-off with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President candidate Atiku Abubakar in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe APC northern governors, in a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of their Abuja meeting on Saturday, advised President Muhammadu Buhari to restrict his search within the party for a successor to the southern states.\n\nThey said power shift to the South would be in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\nBased on the decision, Jigawa State Governor Mohammed Badaru withdrew from the race.\n\nIn the South, the Southwest is the bastion of the APC.\n\nTinubu is the clear favourite in the geo-political zone. He is also being backed strongly by most of the states in the North.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo may get his votes from Ogun which is his home state and Nasarawa where he is believed to be backed by the state governor.\n\nFormer Minister of Transportation Mr. Chibuike Rotmi Amaechi may get his votes from his home state, Rivers, and Plateau where he is being backed by the state governor.\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi may get his votes from Ekiti, Jigawa where the governor is his friend. He may also get some votes from Kebbi because of his closeness to the state governor.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan is being backed by his state, Yobe and states in the Southeast.\n\nOf all the contenders, Tinubu best fits President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s description of the candidate of his choice.\n\nThe President recommended a party man who must be formidable, who appeals to the electorate across the board.\n\nProjection as at today.\n\nTinubu is projected to win Kano, Lagos, Oyo, Borno, Sokoto, Bauchi, Osun, Benue, Ondo, Edo, Katsina, Gombe, Niger, Kaduna, Zamfara and Adamawa states.\n\nOsinbajo: Ogun and Nasarawa.\n\nYahaya Bello: Kogi\n\nAmaechi: Rivers and Plateau\n\nLawan: Yobe, Kebbi (strong), Abia, Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra and Enugu.\n\nFayemi: Ekiti, Jigawa and Kebbi (partially)\n\nAkpabio: Akwa Ibom\n\nAyade: Cross River\n\nUndecided states: Delta and Bayelsa.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThough there was no official statement to confirm the number of victims, it was learnt that the casualty figure included several helpless children. Many also sustained various degrees of injuries.\n\nSome residents of the town attributed the incident to explosion, claiming that an explosive device exploded during the church service. The claim was, however, proved wrong in a video which went viral on the social media where some worshipers were seen in the pool of their own blood after being shot by the suspected bandits.\n\nThe state Police command has deployed anti-bomb squad to Owo.\n\nCommissioner of Police, Mr Oyeyemi Oyediran in a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) yesterday, said the squad comprises officers of the Explosive Ordinance Device Unit of the state police command. He said efforts were being intensified to arrest those who perpetrated the devilish act.\n\nHow we were attacked \u2013Rev. Fr. Abayomi\n\nOne of the priests that officiated the Mass, Rev Father Andrew Abayomi, said the attack was well planned as members of the church were not aware of their presence till the attack was carried out.\n\nHe said the attackers struck as Mass was about to end. \u201cWe were about to round off the service. I had even asked people to start leaving, that was how we started hearing gunshots from different angles. We hid inside the church but some people had left when the attack happened. We locked ourselves in the church for 20 minutes. When we heard that they had left, we opened the church and rushed victims to the hospital,\u201d he explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Director, Social Communications, Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Rev. Fr Augustine Ikwu, has dismissed reports that priests and bishops of the Church were kidnapped as untrue.\n\nAccording to reports in the media, bandits killed worshippers and kidnapped a priest.\n\nHowever, in a letter circulating on twitter last night by the Director of Communications at Catholic Diocese of Ondo, all the Priests and Bishop in the parish are safe and none was kidnapped as reported.\n\n\u201cWe turn to God to console the families of those whose lives were lost to this distressing incident, and we pray for the departed souls to rest in peace. Amen.\n\n\u201cThe Bishop appeals that we remain calm, be law abiding and pray for peace and normalcy to return to our community, state and country.\u201d\n\nNigeria shall never give in to evil, wicked people \u2013 Buhari\n\nReacting, President Muhammadu Buhari, described the killing as heinousand vowed that no matter what, the country woul never give in to evil and wicked people.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said only fiends from the nether region could have conceived and carried out such dastardly act, adding that eternal sorrow awaits them both on earth here, and ultimately in the hereafter.\n\nIt\u2019s a black Sunday in Owo \u2013Akeredolu\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu said the \u201cvile and satanic attack\u201d was a calculated assault on the peace-loving people of Owo Kingdom who have enjoyed relative peace over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is a black Sunday in Owo. Our hearts are heavy. Our peace and tranquility have been attacked by the enemies of the people. This is a personal loss, an attack on our dear state,\u201d the governor who had to cut short his party\u2019s national assignment in Abuja to visit Owo immediately said.\n\n\u201cThis is an unexpected development. I am shocked to say the least. Nevertheless, we shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay. We shall never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in our resolves to rid our state of criminals,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s barbaric, wicked -Osun\n\nOsun State Government, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, said the was totally barbaric, wicked and an act of unprovoked aggression against innocent people.\n\n\u201cIt is both mean and inhumane to turn the sacred sanctuary of a church to a killing field on a Sunday morning.\u201d\n\nIt stated that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola expressed sympathy to the families of those killed in the attack, and especially to the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and the government of Ondo State, adding \u201cwe are also assuring Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the government of Ondo State of our support in any and every way possible.\u201d\n\nPerpetrators must be exposed \u2013 Kalu\n\nFormer governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, also expressed shock and sadness.\n\nLamenting the ugly incident, which he described as evil and sinful, he called on security agencies to deploy their skills in fishing out the perpetrators.\n\nThe former governor admonished appropriate authorities to strengthen the security framework of the country for the sake of peace and unity.\n\nIn a statement, he said all hands must be on deck to stop killings by terrorists across the country.\n\n\u201cI am devastated and shocked over the attack on St. Francis Church, Owo leading to the death of many people with others injured. It is a wicked, evil and sinful act. This is too much to bear.\n\n\u201cIt is a black Sunday. The perpetrators must be exposed and brought to book.\n\n\u201cI urge security agencies to commence full scale investigations in a bid to arrest the perpetrators of the ugly act and avoid recurrence.\u201d\n\nHe commiserated with the government and people of the state while praying to God to grant the departed souls eternal bliss.\n\nKalu also conveyed his condolences to the Catholic community especially the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and wished hospitalized victims quick recovery.\n\nGani Adams condemns attack\n\nAare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams said the attack is not only ungodly, but capable of threatening the foundation and existence of Nigeria.\n\nHe described its perpetrators as evil, saying they have sinned against God and should be ready to face the wrath of the most high God.\n\nExpressing concern on the spate of insecurity across the country, the Yoruba generalissimo insisted that the Federal Government had failed in its efforts to secure the country, wondering why it has become a crime to go the church to worship.\n\nHe challenged the Federal Government to rise to its responsibility, begin thorough investigation into the attack and bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cInvestigation into the Owo Catholic bomb attack should not be swept under the carpet. Those that carried out the attack are not ghosts, they must be apprehended immediately.\u201d\n\nAttack declaration of war -Yoruba group\n\nIlana Omo Oodua Worldwide (IOOW), said the attack is a declaration of war against the Yoruba people\n\nProf Banji Akintoye, leader of the apex body for Yoruba self-determination and self-preservation movement, in a statement by the Communications Secretary, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, enjoined Governor Aketedolu, who is the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, to declare an emergency on the activities of Fulani herdsmen in the state with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cToday, we have all been encircled, most especially, in Lagos. For herdsmen to have the effrontery of bombarding a church in Yorubaland to kill shows that we are now in a realistic danger.\n\n\u201cMy urgent advise to Governor Akeredolu is to pick up the gauntlet and declare an emergency against the activities of all Fulani herdsmen in the state with immediate effect. We have now been taken for granted. We need not pretend anymore. We must demand unanimously, an exit from Nigeria. We the Yoruba people cannot live in the same country with characters whose idea of common citizenship in Nigeria is to brutalise, subjugate and even exterminate us.\u201d\n\nCAN, PDP condemn attack\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) condemned the attack as sad, wrong, condemnable, outrageous, unacceptable and satanic.\n\nIts President, Rev\u2019d Samson Ayokunle, in a statement issued on his behalf by his Media Assistant, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, reiterated its quest for a total overhaul of the security architecture of Nigeria, with a request that President Muhammadu Buhari stops recycling of criminals and terrorists in the name of de-radicalising programme insisting that the programme is counterproductive.\n\n\u201cThis menace of insecurity has gotten out of hands and is embarrassingly sore. Criminals are operating with impunity all over the country and unfortunately our government appears to be so busy with the 2023 general election that it has no time for the unending killings in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat legacy is the government and those who are the managers of our security architecture leaving behind for the unborn generations? We are praying for the government and the security agencies to get it right before it will be too late.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal government is not interested in the state Police, what efforts are being put in place to arrest this unpleasant situation?\u201d\n\nHe, thus called on the governors to meet with the president to find the lasting solution to these killings, insisting that issuing mere press statements of condemnations and what looks like empty threat is apparently not a way out of it.\n\nSimilarly, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said it was alarmed that terrorists invaded a church service, kill worshipers and left unchallenged.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and his government has irretrievably failed in the primary purpose of government which is to provide security and welfare for its citizens. This president has completely abdicated his duties, become numb to daily reports of killings, abductions and kidnappings by terrorists and remain absent when our nation needed him most.\n\n\u201cIt is now crystal clear that President Buhari is incapable, incompetent and does not possess the capacity and integrity to hold office as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He is a failed leader and history will not be kind to him and his administration for his abysmal failure in office.\u201d\n\nCBCN tasks FG\n\nFollowing the attack, the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has lamented that nowhere is safe in the country.\n\nIts President and Archbishop-Elect of Owerri Archdiocese, Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji, in a statement, said he received the news with great shock and sadness.\n\nWhile calling on government to hunt down the attackers and bring them to book, Ugorji added that if government failed to act decisively on such a grave matter, it would be encouraging the descent of anarchy on the nation.\n\n\u201cIt should rise to its primary responsibility of securing the life and property of its citizens. The world is watching us! Above all, God is also watching us.\n\nGo donate blood, NMA tell Nigerians\n\nNigerian Medical Association (NMA) has asked Nigerians to quickly proceed to hospitals housing victims of Owo Catholic church attack for the purpose of donating blood and other helps needed to resuscitate the injured.\n\nThe Association also directed doctors in Ondo State and the environs to mobilize themselves to participate in the treatment of the injured.\n\nIts President, Dr. Uche Ojinmah, in a statement, condemned the inhuman and barbaric.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe received with sadness the news of the wanton killing of innocent Nigerians and abduction of some citizens at Owo in Ondo State by yet to be identified gunmen.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nA chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Osita Okechukwu, has commended the party\u2019s northern states\u2019 governors and political leaders for strengthening Nigeria\u2019s unity by endorsing power shift to the South.\n\nThe Voice of Nigeria (VON) director general further noted that by the gesture, and principled response to building nationhood; the governors and political leaders have thoroughly shamed the leaders of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who, out of desperation for power, attempted to harvest from ethno-religious fault lines in the polity.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nOkechukwu also added that by their unholy attempt to harvest from primordial sentiments, PDP has not only breached rotation convention in its constitution, but wittingly or unwittingly dug its electoral grave in 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my considered view that the sophisticated northern voters, who voted for the late MKO Abiola and former president Olusegun Obasanjo, will, in 2023, vote for APC presidential candidate and shame PDP,\u201d Okechukwu said.\n\nIn a statement he issued in Abuja, the VON director general said the northern APC governors and political leaders deserve commendation for ceding power to the South; hence hoisting Nigeria\u2019s unity flag and advancing the frontiers of democracy.\n\nHe equally contended that the decision to rightfully rotate power to the South, the northern leaders have upheld the progressive bent of APC and exposed the perfidy and opportunistic tendencies of PDP.\n\nOkechukwu said: \u201cI am very elated. I commend APC governors and political leaders of northern belt for their profound patriotic statement, which aligns with Mr. President\u2019s idea of consensus.\n\n\u201cBy this singular decision, they have killed three birds with one stone. One, they hoisted the National Unity Flag by their position that it is the turn of the South to produce the president in 2023. This is about the loftiest way to fly the National Unity Flag at a critical time, when our dear country is highly polarised and in cliff-hanger.\n\n\u201cI must add that this is national healing balm and bridge-building pedigree of APC governors and political leaders of the northern belt, which they anchored on the doctrine of progressivism.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the northern governors and political leaders from APC invoked the progressive philosophy of APC, by placing national interest above parochial interest.\n\nOkechukwu noted that those words on the marble as contained in their statement represent new credo for APC in its march towards building on the foundation for national unity, stability, peace and prosperity, which has been laid by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nTo be exact, he described the action of northern APC governors and leaders as the most noble way to expose PDP for what it represents as not only a perfidious congregation of political unconscionable men, whose only interest and motto is \u2013 \u2018share the money\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigerians have now seen that the dollar rain, cash and carry primary that produced former vice president Atiku Abubakar as the PDP presidential candidate was a pyrrhic victory that has nothing in store for the new Nigerian of our dreams.\n\n\u201cI am inclined to believe that Atiku\u2019s victory is pyrrhic going by Greek mythology, and may not lead to ultimate victory, especially with the patriotic stance of his northern brothers,\u201d he said.\n\nContrasting PDP\u2019s opportunistic stance with APC\u2019s equitable nationalism, Okechukwu pooh-poohed Atiku\u2019s ambivalent politics, saying: \u201cIs it not paradoxical that the same Atiku, who willingly defected from PDP to APC in 2014 on the pretext of protesting breach of zoning by former president Goodluck Jonathan and benefitted from the zoning convention in 2019 should deliberately deploy huge resources to breach the same zoning convention?\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating the APC northern governors, political leaders and President Buhari for being true Nigerians, Okechukwu declared that Nigerians have seen the difference between those who want a better Nigeria and CarpetBaggers who want to trade with the nation\u2019s future.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The survey was carried out by telephone call with a response rate of 52%.

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) is set to hold its special convention Monday (today) at the Eagle Square Abuja to produce its presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nA visit by Blueprint correspondent to the venue revealed that the party is ready for the exercise which many believed, will be a make or mar event.\n\nApart from security beef up, decoration of various stands allocated to various states\u2019 delegates, posters and banners of various presidential aspirants and decorated stage are already in places.\n\nSome 2,340 elected delegates are expected to vote and elect one of the over 23 aspirants jostling for the ticket.\n\nThe top presidential aspirants, according to the APC screening reports include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos state Governor Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi, former Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi among nine others.\n\nWhile inaugurating chairmen and secretaries of various convention committees Sunday at the party\u2019s national secretariat, the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, described the exercise as a \u201cconvention like no other.\u201d\n\nInaugurated committees\n\nNineteen sub-committees for the special national convention were inaugurated by the national chairman..\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu heads Finance and Logistics sub-Committee, Accreditation and Decoration committee has Ogun state Governor Dapo Abiodun; Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu is to oversee Security and Compliance with Gen. Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau (Rtd.), a former Minister of Interior as co-chair.\n\nThe election planning sub-committee has Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu and Imo state Governor Hope Uzodinma as co-chairs Transportation Committee has (Dr.) Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Governor of Kano state to be assisted by Dr Ramatu Tijani Aliyu, Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccommodation committee has Borno state Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, and his Osun counterpart, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, while Nasarawa state Governor Abdullahi Sule heads the Media and Publicity committee. Dr Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment and Prof. Isaac Folorunso Adewole, former Minister of Health, are to head the Medical sub-committee.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami SAN heads the legal committee, Zamafara state Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle and FCT Minister Mohammed Musa Bello are to coordinate the Venue and Site Servicing committee while former National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni heads the Election Appeal committee while Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong and Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq are in charge of Hospitality and Welfare sub-committee.\n\nAccording to Adamu, the committees are expected to organise a befitting event.\n\n\u201cThis convention this year is a bit different from the other convention. It is different because it is the first transition convention of our great party. The forthcoming convention will be expected within our constitution to produce the flag bearer of our great party to contest the presidential slot,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nSpeaking after the inauguration, Governor Bagudu who heads the Convention Planning Committee said some communities have gone to work even before their inauguration.\n\nBagudu tasked all the convention committees to work in harmony for the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cComing at a time like this, it is for all of us to cooperate given what the chairman said clearly and what is known to us. As he said, it is a convention like no other which is intended by God\u2019s grace to produce a presidential flag bearer.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that from comments I have been hearing from party members, we are all energized to ensure that we have a befitting and successful convention,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that while some political forces were scheming as at last night to have a consensus candidate, a top party source told Blueprint correspondent that an elective convention was imperative.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent on the condition of anonymity, the top APC source said: \u201cAt the end of the day, all the scheming to foist a consensus candidate may come to naught. On our party, we are saying that let there be elective convention, let the delegates determine who flies the flag of our party and not some people force someone on us.\u201d\n\nWhile the APC northern governors agreed to power shift to the South, the Southern APC leaders were yet to adopt anyone as a consensus candidate.\n\nBello on northern govs\u2019 stance\n\nWhen contacted Sunday for his reaction to the position of the Northern governors, Bello, one of the presidential aspirants, said he started campaign before any of the northern or southern aspirants.\n\nThe aspirant who spoke through the spokesperson of Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Dr. Yemi Kolapo, wondered whether the northern governors were all aspirants.\n\n\u201cAre they presidential aspirants? They only gave mere recommendation. Has the party agreed to their suggestion?\n\n\u201cEven the national chairman of the party said no decision was taken at the dinner with Mr. President on Saturday. We started this campaign before any of the other aspirants. At this stage, on the eve of the election, you can\u2019t be telling us to withdraw,\u201d the campaign spokesperson said.\n\n\u2018PDP shamed\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, a founding member of the party, Osita Okechukwu, has congratulated the APC northern governors and political leaders for strengthening Nigeria\u2019s unity by endorsing power shift to the South.\n\nHe said \u201cby this singular uncommon patriotic gesture, and principled response to building nationhood; the APC governors and political leaders from the north have thoroughly shamed the leaders of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who out of desperation for power attempted to harvest from ethno-religious fault lines in our polity.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu further said, \u201cby their unholy attempt to harvest from primordial sentiments, PDP has not only breached rotation convention in its constitution, but has wittingly or unwittingly dug their electoral grave in 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my considered view that the sophisticated northern voters, who voted for Chiefs MKO Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo will in 2023 vote for APC presidential candidate and shame PDP.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Sunday, in Abuja, Okechukwu, who is also the Director General (DG) of Voice of Nigeria (VON), noted that the northern APC Governors and political leaders deserve commendation for ceding power to the south; hence hoisting Nigeria\u2019s unity flag and advancing the frontiers of our democracy.\n\nHe contended that \u201cwith the decision to rightfully rotate power to the South, the northern leaders have upheld the progressive bent of APC and exposed the perfidy and opportunistic tendencies of PDP.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu stated: \u201cI am very elated. I commend APC Governors and political leaders of Northern belt for their profound patriotic statement, which aligns with the Mr President\u2019s idea of consensus. By this singular decision, they have killed three birds with one stone.\n\n\u201cOne, they hoisted the National Unity Flag by their position that it is the turn of the south to produce Nigeria\u2019s President in 2023. This is about the loftiest way to fly the National Unity Flag at a critical time, when our dear country is highly polarised and in cliff-hanger.\n\n\u201cI must add that this is national healing balm and bridge-building pedigree of APC Governors and political leaders of the Northern belt, which they anchored on the doctrine of progressivism.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

          "title": "Construction of $15.6bn Abidjan-Lagos Highway to Benefit 40m West Africans, Says Nigeria\u2019s Works Minister Fashola",
          "text": "When completed, the construction of the 1,028-kilometre Abidjan-Lagos highway would benefit at least 40 million West Africans, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola (SAN), said at the weekend.\n\nThe highway estimated to cost $15.6 billion which is expected to have significant impact on the economies of five regional countries, namely: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria, he said, remained firmly on course.\n\nSpeaking at the 16th inter-ministerial meeting of the group in Abuja, Fashola who doubles as the Chairman of the five regional ministerial steering committee, noted that the resources were being mobilised to ensure the Nigerian axis of the project was completed soon.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria section is the famous Lagos-Badagry corridor. As the designs are going on, integration is going on and our government led by President Muhammadu Buhari through his tax-credit scheme, has mobilised the resources that will ensure that the Lagos-badagry section of this highway can be fully paid for.\n\n\u201cMoney is now in place and work is now going on and those who are familiar with the corridor must have realised that between December last year and the first quarter of this year, there has been more rapid deployment of men, machines and materials along that corridor,\u201d he assured.\n\nFashola further revealed that the link bridge between Nigeria and Cameroon, which was largely funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) would be commissioned this month.\n\n\u201cWe have completed a new link bridge that links Nigeria to Cameroon, and it was funded largely by the AfDB and we are hoping that the ECOWAS commission will give us the necessary support to ensure the formal opening of that bridge sometime in the month of June,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the minister, the commitment to the piece of infrastructure is to upgrade the road network into a first class six lane highway, stressing that although there was need for speed, quality must not be sacrificed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to deliver a better life for five countries and over 40 million people who use that corridor, almost on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThe future is bright, this is an important investment for the people of Africa to achieve the objective of the Africa Union (AU) to create a trans-African highway,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso speaking, the Chief Transport Economist, AfDB and Task Manager for the project, Lydie Ehouman, said the bank had been able to secure an agreement for an additional \u20ac3.5 million for the road project.\n\nEhouman added that with the addition, it brings the total amount available for the initial financing of the strategic study on the project to $ 41 million.\n\n\u201cThe agreement for the on-lending of this additional grant by the bank to ECOWAS is currently being finalised. Thus, in addition to its substantial contribution of $25 million, the bank will have mobilised \u20ac12.63 million in the form of a grant from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThis brings the total amount available for the financing of this highly strategic study to the equivalent of about US$ 41 million,\u201d the AfDB top employee stated.\n\nHowever, she noted that the claim of delay by consultants in member countries were not tenable, since the agreement was that work should continue while any variation could be discussed and resolved.\n\nIn his remarks, Ghana\u2019s Minister of Roads and Highways, Kwasi Amoako-Attah urged the government of the five countries to do everything possible to help remove whatever impediment that may be slowing down the project.\n\nHe called on member states to speed up the negotiation with the consultants to reach amicable settlement, explaining that West Africa cannot afford to lose any more time.\n\n\u201cI would also want to call on my colleague ministers again to humbly consider a fair compensation, so as to enable the consultants to undertake that assignment within our revised timelines,\u201d he added.\n\nThe ECOWAS Commissioner for Infrastructure, Mr. Pathe Gueye, in his remarks, said technical studies had been extended from June 2021 to December 2022, as a result of the setback occasioned by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAppropriate measures relating to this resumption should also be taken, in particular, the extension of the deadlines of the contracts that have expired,\u201d he noted.",

          "text": "Sunday\u2019s attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa Street, Owo Kingdom, Ondo State, by criminal terrorists, leaving scores dead in its wake, mostly women and children, might have had devastating consequences on the quest for northern presidency in 2023.\n\nAlthough a debate on the justification for a northern president after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s eight years, has always ended in stalemate, Sunday\u2019s terrorist attack on innocent worshippers, has however, made the idea more untenable in view of the current realities.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAlready, the governors from both north and south, had reviewed the security situation in the country, and were said to have come to a realisation that the joke was on them if they sat back and allowed hoodlums take over the country.\n\nHowever, with the security situation this bad under a northern president, more so a retired general, the governors unanimously agreed to do something different in order to get a different result, hence the need to ensure a unifier from the south.\n\n\u201cOwo killings had not crept into the picture when the governors met and concluded they could no longer sit back and allow hoodlums take over the country. So, they agreed to go to the south and try a new perspective, given thew increasing insecurity in every part of the country.\n\n\u201cBut with the mindless killings of women and innocent children, who had gone to worship in Church by terrorists, northern presidency becomes arguably untenable and might have died a natural death, because those who ordinarily should push it are no longer interested,\u201d said a source privy to one of the governors\u2019 meetings.\n\nThe source, who claimed that the northern governors were the ones personally campaigning for a southern president, explained that the only remaining northern candidate in the race for APC ticket, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, constituted no threat to the cause and resolution of the governors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only northern candidate still in the race, Ahmad Lawan, has no experience. He has never run anything in his life. He has never run a state; he has never run any business, therefore, he poses no threat to southern presidency with its array of supporters from the north.\n\n\u201cSo, essentially what the governors are trying to do is to see if they could do the consensus that could unite the country and move on from the present phase. The killings are not tenable and do not represent who we are as a people.\u201d\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the scene of the incident, it was observed that the gunmen used dynamites to blow the altar of the church while the service was going on.\n\nParts of the altar POP caved in, as the gunmen shot many worshipers.\n\nBloodstains were seen on the floor of the church as corpses were moved to the Federal Medical Centre and St Louis Catholic Hospital, Owo, as well as those who sustained injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, the different presidential aspirants in the party, have already begun to mobilise cash and alliances for last minute push.\n\nA party source confided in THISDAY that the APC aspirants, have only decided to downplay the magnitude of what is going on now, because of the backlash from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) open trading with delegates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s last minute mobilisation of cash that\u2019s already going on and it is across all the aspirants. None is left out. Besides, there\u2019s also alliances being negotiated ahead of the D-Day. And all of this is being done to ensure a southerner does not just emerge candidate of the ruling party but goes ahead to win the general election. This is why the last minute push is intense,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "The food inflation as well as scarcity of farm additives in Nigeria occasioned by the war between Russia and Ukraine, may be tempered soon, with President Vladimir Putin assuring African leaders of his readiness to allow their export to the continent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government had recently lamented that the war was causing another wave of global economic distortion reflecting in the cost of food and fertiliser in the country.\n\nAside grains export from Ukraine, Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said that as a fertiliser-producing country, it has been tough getting potash, a key ingredient in the production of the agricultural commodity, which had led to skyrocketing prices.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria as a producer of fertiliser, one of the major inputs for fertiliser production, potash, is also affected. Now it is scarce and that means that the input is very expensive and we are seeing that reflecting in the cost of fertiliser,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in April, Nigeria bought emergency supplies of potash after the country was unable to import the key fertiliser ingredient from Ukraine-Russia due to the impact of the invasion.\n\nHowever, during a meeting with the Chairperson of the African Union (AU), Senegal\u2019s President Macky Sall, Putin told the representative of African leaders that he was ready to enable the export of Ukrainian grain to ease a global food crisis that is hitting Africa especially hard.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin has expressed to us his willingness to facilitate the export of Ukrainian cereals,\u201d Sall wrote on Twitter after meeting Putin in his role as chairman of the AU.\n\nRussia was also ready to ensure the export of its own wheat and fertiliser, Sall said, according to Reuters, after the talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nSall did not say if Putin had attached any conditions to his offer, but Russia had previously said it is ready to allow vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine in return for the lifting of some Western sanctions against it, a proposal that Ukraine has described as \u201cblackmail\u201d.\n\nAfrica is heavily dependent on grain supplies from Russia and Ukraine that have been badly disrupted by the war.\n\n\u201cI have come to see you, to ask you to be aware that our countries, even far from the theatre (of war), are the victims of this economic crisis,\u201d Sall told Putin earlier.\n\nRussia\u2019s army has seized much of Ukraine\u2019s southern coastline and its warships control access to the country\u2019s Black Sea ports. Yet it continues to blame Ukraine and the West for the resulting halt in Ukrainian grain exports.\n\nPutin told Russian state TV in an interview broadcast that Ukraine could export grain from ports including Odesa if it cleared them of mines.\n\n\u201cLet them remove the mines, we guarantee them free passage to international waters,\u201d he said. Putin said the easiest way to ship out Ukrainian grain would be via neighbouring Belarus, but that it would require the West to lift sanctions on on the country.\n\nAfrican countries are acutely affected by the growing crisis, which has sent prices of grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser soaring in recent times.\n\nRussia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, while Russia is also a key global fertiliser exporter and Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil.\n\nAside wheat, oil and farm additives, \u201cTrading Economics\u201d recently stated that Nigeria imported as much as $124.61 million worth of iron and steel in 2020, sugar and confectionary worth $8.19 million, pharmaceutical products valued at $7.6 million as well as dairy products worth $2.31 million.\n\nIn addition, Nigeria also brings in animal fodder, glass and glassware, textiles, paper and paperboards, edible fruits, organic chemicals , among others from the European country.",
