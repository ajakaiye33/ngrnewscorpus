          "text": "A member of the House of Representatives, Ibrahim Almustapha, has said that Nigeria\u2019s current challenges are signs of greatness, saying the country has the capacity to surmount them.\n\nAlmustapha, a member of the All Progressives Congress, who represents Wurno/Rabah Federal Constituency of Sokoto State at the National Assembly, said this when he spoke with newsmen on Sunday.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo me, I see most of these challenges, especially the security challenge facing the country, as a sign of greatness, many great nations passed through lots of challenges on their way to greatness.\n\n\u201cI believe the same situation applies to Nigeria and once we are able to overcome them, Nigeria will certainly become great in every aspect of human endeavours, in terms of economy, infrastructure, power, and all others.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is to come together as a nation with sincerity, towards tackling the challenges, Nigerians who are fond of celebrating bad news and negativity should stop.\n\n\u201cThose supplying information and logistics to bandits and armed robbers should stop and those entrusted with the task of fighting them should be more sincere.\u201d\n\nAlmustapha said that, although, Nigeria had recorded some achievements in the fight against Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, much needed to be done.\n\n\u201cI think the North-East has witnessed relative peace for some time now, certainly, the situation is not the way it was in 2015 when the APC came into power,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)-led Federal Government, would succeed in its bid to tackle the security challenges bedeviling the country.\n\nAlmustapha said that the new leadership of the APC would reposition the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about discipline, determination, and uprightness, I think you are talking about the new APC executives led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmustapha said the APC would win the 2023 general elections without much challenge.\n\n\u201cNigerians love APC, they love Buhari, and I\u2019m sure you must have seen the tremendous progress made in terms of infrastructure since the regime came in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf I should ask you which other political party exists in the country with that kind of credential certainly, you will reply that there\u2019s non.\n\n\u201cIn terms of development, no party can match the APC, even with the numerous economic, social, security, and even COVID-19 challenges, the APC administration has done well.\n\n\u201cJust take a look around Nigeria, you will see massive infrastructure development everywhere, there is also massive agricultural intervention everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmustapha added, \u201cI think the APC has performed very well, especially when compared with the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s years.\n\n\u201cI can comfortably tell you that the APC will win the 2023 general election with a landslide victory.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the party would remain united ahead of the general election.\n\n\u201cAre you not surprised that we conducted our National Convention successfully despite all odds.\n\n\u201cWe had about eight chairmanship aspirants and all of them came together and agreed to step down for Adamu, the same scenario would repeat itself during the primary election and it will be hitch-free.\n\n\u201cWe in the APC are out for the goodness of Nigeria, we are not out to pursue an individual interest, ours is the collective interest of Nigeria, we have to agree and disagree on issues.\n\n\u201cOur election at the convention was mostly based on consensus, this is exactly what will be repeated at the primaries and we will forge ahead as a party,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nNAN",

They were both seasoned trade unionists.\u201d\n\nHe called on governments at all levels, especially the Federal Government, to work towards securing the lives and property of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, nowhere is safe now \u2013 we cannot travel by air, road is not safe and neither is the rail. Is Nigeria a failed state? It is unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Congress condoles with the families and friends of our comrades and the good people of Kogi State for this irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nSunday Vanguard gathered from one of the sympathizers, a member of the TUC, during a visit to the Akinwunmi family residence that he was hit by the stray bullets that were severally fired at the passengers by one of the bandits after the bomb attack.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him while inside the train some minutes earlier. He said he had left Abuja that he was inside the train on his way to Kaduna\u201d, the widow told Sunday Vanguard.\n\n\u201cMoments later when I heard about the train attack, I immediately called him again, and his phone started ringing.\n\n\u201cI was initially happy expecting him to speak with me from the other end only for another voice to tell that he was a mortuary attendant, that the owner of the phone had died and that his body was with them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kwara State government has said that it would not leave the family alone in this trying period, and urged other stakeholders to rally round them.\n\nAkinwunmi, in his forties, was a staff member of Dangote Group in Ilorin until the company was recently bought over and he was inaugurated as the TUC Chairman about two years ago.\n\nThree children\n\nModupe, in her mid thirties, wept uncontrollably with her three children, two boys, one girl, as they sat on the sofa at their apartment at Ita-Elepa area of Ilorin on Wednesday as sympathizers thronged the place.\n\n\u201cI know that the almighty God has answered my prayers that wherever my husband is right now, he\u2019s resting in the bosom of the Lord. My hubby was the best,\u201d she said during the short interview with Sunday Vanguard.\n\nHead of Service in Kwara State, Mrs. Modupe Susan Oluwole, who led a government delegation on a condolence visit, said the family will hear from Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on the support he would give to the family very soon and urged family and friends to provide immediate succor to the widow and children.\n\nOluwole said, \u201cI want to join others in the call to Federal Government for better security in Nigeria. I know they are doing their best but God will help us to see the end of these crises in security.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for anybody, nobody is safe. It is not a question of I am safe, we are all in this together, so we must fight it together.\n\n\u201cI want to call on the family, especially those who will be here when all of us would have left, that they should provide succor to the immediate family. They should not leave this family alone.\n\n\u201cI know that His Excellency, the Governor of Kwara State, will recognize the role of labour and also recognize his own personal role as a labour leader.\n\n\u201cSo, whatever it is that the governor can do to support, I am sure, we will convey the message by the grace of God. You will hear from us very soon.\u201d\n\nGood man\n\nThe late labour leader, from the aggregate of comments from stakeholders, including journalists, is generally seen as an exemplary good man, with kind heart and very generous too.\n\nThe Treasurer of TUC in Kwara State, Comrade Oyekale Rebecca Nike, said, \u201cAs you can see, I have not recovered from the shock of the news of his death.\n\nWe had lot of conversations few days before this rude shock came in.\n\n\u201cWe had differences but we mended fences and moved on. Akinwumi was a friend and a boss.\n\n\u201cWith this shock, I cannot describe what he was to me, but he was the Chairman and I am the Treasurer of the Trade Union Congress in Kwara. He was a very good man to me\n\nThe PRO of the state TUC, Comrade Raheem Wasiu Oladimeji, on his part, said, \u201cWe shared a very cordial relationship, very close indeed. Akinsola Akinwunmi was a man of integrity, a dogged fighter and always stuck to his beliefs.\n\n\u201cHe was a very generous personality, not because he was financially inclined; he had that spirit of giving, not only to his immediate family but also to all that came his way.\n\n\u201cHe also demonstrated capacity, both intellectual and ability, to rally round any member in need not only TUC but also at his own local chapter at Dangote Group. \u201cOne of his latest significant impacts is the negotiation for the minimum wage payment in Kwara.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine him, who warned and advised us whenever we traveled to Kaduna to be careful not to be kidnapped, now turned out a victim and killed. So sad!\n\n\u201cThe load and responsibility he left behind are enormous especially at a time like this. I pray that God in His infinite mercies consoles the family and all dependants left behind.\u201d\n\nGovernor AbdulRazaq earlier commiserated with the labour unions and the Akinwunmi family in a statement by Rafiu Ajakaye, his Chief Press Secretary.\n\nThe immediate past Chairman of the TUC in Kwara State, Comrade Kola Olumoh, in his own remark, said that he and the deceased were supposed to be part of the TUC executive meeting in Ilorin on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe death was so shocking. Such a vibrant young man. We lost him. In fact, I am sad and really down. He\u2019s a person with prospect\u201d, Olumoh said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come to know his rights and wrongs. We had issues before he came on board, you know, and he came to me and we resolved the matter. Since his inauguration, he\u2019s been very diligent and resourceful\u201d.\n\nIn another condolence message, a pro-democracy group, Kwara Must Change, sympathized with the state chapter of nTUC over loss of Akinwunmi.\n\nThe group also called for improved security, through overhaul of security architecture in the country.\n\nIn a statement by Kwara Must Change Convener, Abdulrazaq Hamzat, the group said that the train attack was an unfortunate development that should not have been allowed to happen.",

          "text": "Kolapo Kola-Daisi, a Fellow of the Financial Markets Dealers Association, FFMDA, is an Oyo South Senatorial District aspirant under the All Progressive Congress. The scion of elder statesman, lawyer, businessman and Bashorun of Ibadan, Chief Kola Daisi believes he is coming to politics to make a difference. In this chat, he spoke on his vision for the people, role of Nigerian youths and other sundry issues. Excerpts:\n\nBy Udo Ibuot\n\nWhat really motivated you to dabble in the murky waters of Nigerian politics?\n\nI joined the political race to make a difference. A one-time American President Harry Truman once said \u201cA man has to have a programme. You have to be known for something otherwise you will never get anywhere.\u201d I decided to use all my financial and banking experience to alleviate the suffering of our people. My people in Oyo South Senatorial District have been crying out for change.\n\nHow do I know this, I have gone on courtesy calls and consultations with stakeholders at the grassroots level. The vibes I received was that people are yearning for effective representation. The people have become fed up with the existing state of affairs and are desirous of a new and credible representation at the senatorial level. My mission is to make Oyo State great again, and on a larger scale make Nigeria great. I want to make a difference by utilising all the experiences I have garnered in the business world. And to really make that difference is through getting involved in politics to help the people.\n\nAs a young man of 43, how do you hope to make a difference amidst these old politicians?\n\nI have a four-point agenda for the people of Oyo South Senatorial District. The first is through human capital development. We need to annex human resources we have on ground. The second is to focus on the improvement and development of the social infrastructure, while the third is to focus in education and training. The fourth agenda is empowerment of our women. I call this, Women Empowerment and Gender mainstreaming. This will help to engender sustainable development in the society. I am determined to lift the youths and women out of poverty by providing amenities of life for them.\n\nSome leaders like former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida are advocating that youths should be given a chance at all levels of governance. What is your take?\n\nWhat they are saying in earnest cannot be set aside. At the same time, we still have some tested and confirmed elder statesmen that we cannot ignore. However, youths need to come to terms with realities of the day. Our youths have to take advantage of their huge population in demanding change. If 90 per cent of the population is below 50 years, I think it\u2019s about time they take their destiny into their hands.\n\nI believe that our youths have the capacity to contribute to the growth and development of the country. We must be proactive by playing a key role in the struggle for a new Nigeria. It is a common saying that politics is a dirty game, yet we should not be discouraged, if we really want to make our state and country a better place for the unborn generations. I think there is a lot we can do, there is a lot we can bring to the table, and we can share from the little experience we have.\n\nHow do you think that challenges facing Nigeria such as insecurity, ritual killings and kidnappings can be confronted?\n\nThe various challenges confronting Nigeria today can be attributed to poor leadership at different levels of government. I am ready to change things if I get the opportunity to serve my people as a legislator in the National Assembly. The electorates are the sole determinants of the leadership they get.\n\nThe choice the electorate makes at the polls rightly or wrongly is what leads to electing competent and incompetent leaders respectively. Our people should shun politics of stomach infrastructure. The electorate should be able to make informed decisions to avoid voting into office, self-serving politicians whose only aim of seeking political power is to feather their nest at the peril of the masses.",

          "text": "The Court of Appeal has ordered the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and others to desist from taking steps capable of frustrating hearing in an appeal filed against judgment of a Federal High Court which ordered removal of section 84 (12) from the new Electoral Act.\n\nThis is as the appellate court granted nod to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to join as person interested in an appeal against the high court judgment which voided and struck down section 84 (12) of the Act.\n\nPDP was granted the permission by the Owerri division of the Appeal Court to file its appeal as an interested person against the decision of the Federal High Court, Umuahia, on the order for removal of the section from the Electoral law.\n\nIn an enroll order of the Court of Appeal sighted in Abuja by our correspondent and signed by the Presiding Justice of the court, Justice Rita Noshakhare Pemu, the leave granted PDP to file an appeal was occasioned by submissions of its counsel, D.C Denwigwe, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN.\n\nThe appeal marked CA/OW/87/2022 has Chief Nduka Edede and the Attorney General of the Federation AGF as the 1st and 2nd respondents respectively.\n\nThe enroll order read in part \u201d Upon reading the application herein filed on 23-3-2022 with an affidavit in support sworn to by John Eronini on the same date and after hearing DC Denwigwe SAN for the applicant and Chief Emeka Ozoani SAN for the 1st respondent, order is hereby granted as follows;\n\n\u201cLeave is hereby granted the applicant (PDP) to appeal as person interested in this appeal CA/OW/87/2022.\n\n\u201cDue to the exigencies of this appeal and its Constitutional colorization, there is need to hear this matter expeditiously.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Appellant is hereby given up to Tuesday 12th of April, 2022 to file its notice of Appeal and the parties are to file their respective briefs of arguments within three days from the date of service of the notice and record of Appeal on the respondents.\n\n\u201d There shall be a further three days given to the appellant to file a reply.\n\n\u201cParties should desist from taking any step to frustrate the hearing of the appeal.\n\n\u201cThe matter is adjourned to the 4th of May, 2022, for the hearing of the appeal.\n\n\u201cFresh hearing notice to be issued on the 2nd to the 12th respondents\u201d.\n\nA Federal High Court, Umuahia division had on March 18 declared as invalid and unconstitutional section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nJustice Evelyn Anyadike in a judgment ordered the Attorney General of the Federation to delete the said section from the amended Electoral Act.\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act provides that, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nThe high court which ordered that the section be struck out held that sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that government appointees seeking to contest elections are only to resign at least 30 days before the election.\n\nThe court therefore held that any other law that mandates such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nJustice Anyadike, thereafter, ordered Abubakar Malami to delete the contended section 84(12) from the constitution.\n\nHowever, the National Assembly, which enacted the contentious section 84 (12) had lodged an appeal at the Court of Appeal in Owerri against the Umuahia court judgment ordering the AGF to delete Section 84(12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nThe suit at the Federal High Court Umuahia is marked; FHC/UM/CS/26/2022 and its judgment\n\nfaulted the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 and declared it unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null void and of no effect.\n\nThe NASS in its Appeal held that the high court erred in law because the clause in question is directed at political appointees and not civil servants.\n\nNASS claimed that the high court passed judgment on a matter which was not included in the Electoral Act and concluded that its decision was liable to be set aside by the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe National Assembly also challenged why it was not joined as a respondent in the suit, being the only body with constitutional power to alter any part of the legislation which it passed.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 25 assented to the Electoral Act 2022 but however, objected to the provision of Section 84 (12).\n\nHe later asked the National Assembly to amend the section of the Act, but the request was rejected by the lawmakers.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had on its own dragged President Buhari before a Federal High Court in Abuja challenging moves to alter the amended Electoral Act.\n\nBuhari was sued along with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), and Minister of Justice, Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives, Clerk of the National Assembly, Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nThe party also joined as defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022 Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Deputy Senate Leader and Deputy House of Representatives Leader.\n\nThe main opposition party in the suit filed on its behalf by Chief James Ogwu Onoja, SAN, had prayed the Federal High Court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from altering the duly signed Electoral Act or withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\nThe PDP also applied for an order of the court stopping the National Assembly from giving effect to President Buhari\u2019s request to remove section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that will make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nThe grouse of the PDP is that President Buhari having assented to the Bill on February 25, 2022, cannot give any directive to the National Assembly to take immediate steps to remove the section or any section of the Act on any ground whatsoever.\n\nIn a ruling on PDP\u2019s ex-parte application, Justice Inyang Ekwo had ordered defendants in the suit to suspend all actions on any attempt to alter the Electoral Act.",

But before then, the officer who always believes that he can extort some money from a young man wearing peculiar hair must be weaned off such orientation by exposing him to the rules of modern policing and ultimately, making sure that he earns enough legitimately at the end of the day to support his family dependents.\n\nIn their respective speeches, the Coordinator, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Imo State, Mrs. Ukachi Ukah; the Executive Director, Vivacious Development Initiative, Onyinyechi Nwosu, said until the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is reformed and adequately funded, efforts to instil discipline and professionalism in the institution will continue to remain a mirage.\n\nAccording to them, until the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is reformed and adequately funded, efforts to instill discipline and professionalism in the institution will continue to remain a mirage.\n\nAlso speaking, a Human rights activist, Jaja Martins, pointed out that a poorly remunerated police personnel, who is constantly faced with family\u2019s financial challenges, would certainly cut corners on his job.\n\nThe human rights activist said, \u201d Brutality, which is consequent upon extortion, occurs as a result of the government\u2019s inability to properly take care of the welfare of police officers.\u201d",

He has, consequently, asked the National Assembly to expunge it from the Act.\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia has also declared the provision null and void and asked the Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister Abubakar Malami (SAN) to delete it forthwith.\n\nThe National Assembly has appealed against the ruling.\n\nAmaechi, speaking at a special thanksgiving service organised by the Rivers State Chapter of the APC at Adokiye Amesiamaka Stadium, Igwuurita-Ali in the state, said his decision was borne out of concern for suffering Nigerians.\n\nHe said having served as Speaker of the State House of Assembly for eight years, governor for another eight years and minister for seven years, \u201cmy years of experience has equipped me well.\u201d\n\nHe said he was also \u201ccompelled by the urgency of our present challenges to place my experience and proven capacity at the service of the nation at the highest level.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are facing some very serious challenges as a country. These are problems of insecurity, challenges of greater accountability in governance, youth unemployment and scourge of spiral poverty.\n\n\u201cThese problems are however not the exclusive preserve of Nigerians. We live in a troubled world; the reality we use to know has altered in nearly every nation.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said he would serve Nigerians as a servant and not a master, adding that he would be President to all Nigerians if elected into office.\n\nHe then jogged round the stadium to prove his physical fitness for the job.\n\nAt the declaration ceremony were Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, former national chairman of the APC Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Senator Ali Ndume, among others.\n\nAmaechi had late last month said on Arise Television that he had no interest in the presidential race.\n\nHe said groups and individuals urging him on to join the race should rather give him the money for nomination forms.\n\nOsinbajo ends consultations, to declare \u2018any moment from now\u2019\n\nFrom the camp of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo came indications yesterday that he too is poised to formally join the race any moment from now, even as early as tomorrow, having concluded his consultations on whether to contest or not.\n\n\u201cHe has ended his consultations across board and he will declare his stand any moment from now, even as early as Monday (tomorrow),\u201d an Aso Rock Presidential Villa source told The Nation yesterday.\n\nAnother source said: \u201cHis (Osinbajo) body language in the Villa is predictable. He has a team working day and night for his declaration.\n\n\u201cAs at last week, his blueprint/manifesto was ready. He may introduce a digital dimension to the campaign.\n\n\u201cI think he is just biding his time for strategic reasons. Now, there are signs that in the next few days, he will open up.\u201d\n\nChieftains of the APC who had earlier declared interest in the party\u2019s presidential ticket are National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; former Abia State governor and serving senator, Orji Kalu and the immediate past governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha.\n\nParty in panic mode over threat of Electoral Act S.84 (12)\n\nParty sources said yesterday that further delay in resolving the controversy over Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act may work against the interest of the party in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nIt provides that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn effect, political appointees including Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi, must resign at least 30 days to the party primaries to be eligible to participate in the process or stand as a candidate, failing which the primary will be a nullity.\n\nIt is for this reason that some state governors have asked political appointees and other public servants aspiring for political offices in the 2023 general elections to quit immediately.\n\nAccording to the 2023 elections time table released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the parties have up to June 3, 2022 to conclude their primaries, during which candidates for all elective offices will be picked.\n\nParties can pick any day between April 4 and June 3 to pick their candidates for the various elective offices.\n\nAPC will not flout the law \u2013 Morka\n\nHowever, APC National Publicity, Felix Morka, said yesterday that the party would comply fully with the law.\n\nAsked the position of the party on the Electoral Act provisions requiring political appointees to resign before contesting, Morka said: \u201cThe ministers are members of the party, and the party is the party.\n\n\u201cNow, both the ministers and other appointees and the party leadership have excellent counsel and guidance.\n\n\u201cI am sure everyone involved intends to comply fully with the intendment and letters of the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nSome members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party contacted claimed that the party was yet to discuss the issue. They, however, said the party has no choice but to comply with the law.\n\nA member of the NWC said: \u201cAfter the national convention, the understanding we have as a party is that henceforth everything we are going to be doing, we shall be guided by the law.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that NWC has not discussed it, but this is a law that should be complied with by all. The position of most party leaders is that all appointees should resign even before they make public their intention to contest.\n\n\u201cSo, I expect the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, who declared today (yesterday) in Port Harcourt, and all other appointees to do the needful by obeying the law.\n\n\u201cThey cannot afford any grandstanding or think they can circumvent the law.\u201d\n\nContacted on the phone yesterday, former Niger State Commissioner for Information and one time State Publicity Secretary of APC, Comrade Jonathan Vatsa, cautioned the party against making nomination forms available to any political appointee who refuses to comply with the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWhy will ministers be different? Some state governors have directed their appointees nursing ambition to contest in the forthcoming elections to resign. I wonder why ministers would be exempted.\n\n\u201cThe law is the law. All appointees at the national and sub-national levels should comply with the law. Failing to do so, the party should deny such individuals nomination forms.\n\n\u201cNobody should think he or she is above the law. It may interest you to know that even the 1999 Constitution directs political appointees to resign.\u201d\n\nElect responsible leaders irrespective of age -Bankole\n\nFormer House of Representatives Speaker Dimeji Bankole yesterday asked Nigerians to elect responsible leaders who have interest in the Nigerian project,no matter the age of such people.\n\nBankole spoke in Kaduna as special guest of honour at the 16th Annual Ramadan Lecture organized by Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria.\n\nWhat is more important for Nigeria,according to him, is responsible leadership made up of people who are interested and committed to the Nigerian project, rather than the debate over age of the candidates.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to pray and take part in the process and try as much as possible to have responsible people interested in the Nigerian project to lead irrespective of their age,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the topic of the Lecture, \u2018Social Media; Effects on Morality\u2019, Hon. Bankole said social media is not the cause of Nigeria\u2019s problems, but rather a consequence of its problems, adding that, \u201cwithout a proper diagnostic experience, we cannot begin to proffer solutions to Nigeria\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get our responsibilities in the right order, from home, this thing can be treated from primary schools, secondary schools, formative years of young people, parents getting involved, empowering the local governments to make sure this thing work, then we will begin to get proper foundation that would be very difficult for anyone to dissuade into bad immoral behaviour.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians ,as believers,should go back to the books for solutions to myriads of challenges confronting the nation.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIslam is a wonderful religion, which is not complicated at all. It has solved problems from day one till now, yet the Quran is still the same book, irrespective of different developments in this world, we still apply it and it gives us solutions.\u201d\n\nHe said the Holy book has laid down the rules and the order of their application, \u201cthe problem here is that we are putting number five as number one and we expect peace to reign. We cannot begin to scheme and think we are better than Allah.\u201d",

I won\u2019t betray you all. This is me here. I\u2019m fine, hale and healthy.\n\n\u201cYoruba struggle will remain, and it will be stronger. Yorubas are suffering and smiling. They are killing, kidnapping and doing all sort in Yorubaland and we are not talking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back home soon. I\u2019m a true son of the soil. One cannot be scared of his father\u2019s home. Nothing will happen and no one will be scared of anyone.\n\n\u201cAll that I\u2019ve asked the Federal Government they are yet to answer, and the court has ruled in my favour. Asides from the judgement in Benin Republic, I\u2019m coming to follow up with my judgement in Nigeria. Federal Government must pay my money. It is 20bn.\n\n\u201cWhen I get back to my base in Ibadan, I will thank everyone specially again. You will see me well. Dear Yorubas, don\u2019t be scared, Igboho is back.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking president Talon, he said: \u201cThere were so many rumors, and that he (President Talon) collected money from Nigeria\u2019s president, and has betrayed the Yoruba struggle. All were lies. Look at me, do I look like someone who went to Prison? Help me thank the president. I\u2019m very strong, hale and hearty. All my needs were catered for while in prison.\u201d\n\nHe stated there would have been no reason for agitation in Nigeria if the government had developed the country and protected the lives and properties of the citizens the way the government of Benin Republic had done for its people.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria was like Benin Republic, I would have not bothered myself with any struggle. Look at how Benin Republic has developed so well. I\u2019ve been shuffling through Benin since 1996.\n\n\u201cFor those seven months, there was no blackout and we never ran out of water. I was stunned. Foreigners are trooping into Benin Republic; the government is building infrastructure and the President is investigating the projects.\n\n\u201cThe people of Benin Republic ought to appreciate God for the kind of leader He has given them. If we have such a government in Nigeria, no one will agitate. Citizens will be happy in a country where the government provides stable power supply, adequate security, and adequate water supply, because that is a good government,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on how he felt when they informed him of his release from prison, he said: \u201cThe day I was released, I was playing \u201cAyo\u201d with an inmate, and a police came, he said \u201cChief come, where is your lawyer? He said call your wife and lawyer, your father is around (Baba Akintoye). President has released you.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and asked him to show me a document to that effect. It was written in French. It took the efforts of another inmate to interpret it and he told me I\u2019ve been released and that was how I believed. When I called my lawyer, they told me they were on their way and were already aware of my freedom. I thought I was dreaming.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers stood by me, and they said I should be calm despite the charges that they wanted to investigate against me.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors from the South have rejected proposal by the party to throw open the 2023 presidential contest to all qualified aspirants.\n\nThe governors after a meeting in Abuja on Friday night insisted that the PDP 2023 presidential ticket must be zoned to the South in the spirit of equity and fair play.\n\nThis followed the recommendation of the PDP committee on zoning headed by Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, that the presidential ticket should be thrown open to all the qualified aspirants.\n\nThe Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, who spoke after the meeting on behalf of the governors, at a press briefing, said that their stance was based on the resolutions of the Southern Governors Forum at the meetings in Delta and Lagos states that the presidency must be zoned to the South in 2023.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by Governors Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Diri Douye (Bayelsa).\n\nThe Abia governor, who is also the vice chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, stated that it was not the fault of the South that the opposition party did not win the presidential poll in 2019, when the ticket was ceded to the North.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with keen interest the developments in our party especially concerning zoning.

You take a decision and remain firm on that decision. We think what this country is lacking today is our ability to dispense equity and justice.

We met this morning and resolved as follows: we have agreed to work together as a team. We will work together to ensure that a South Easterner emerges as PDP flag bearer for 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe intend to consult with other zones on this issue and it is based on fairness and equity. In doing so, it is important to note that we have always supported other zones, and we now expect them to reciprocate.\u201d\n\nOn whether the four aspirants, will come up with a consensus candidate from the Southeast, Anyim said: \u201cWhen we get to the bridge, we\u2019ll cross it. But we will work together in the interest of the party, in the interest of the nation, and in the interest of Southeast.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF, while responding to a question whether they have the support of Governors Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu of Enugu and Abia states respectively, said that the question should rather be directed to the governors.",

We don\u2019t want Vice President. Please Ngige, you have done enough consultations. Don\u2019t consult again. Join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe know your antecedents the periods you served as governor of Anambra State and Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You have been in the \u2018labour room\u2019 in the past seven years as the Minister of Labour and Employment, attending to all the labour disputes brought to your table. Please, join the presidential race. We will support you. We will follow you to Aso Rock.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Eze-Ndigbo Bauchi, Igwe Jude Umezika, described Ngige as a unifier and bridge-builder who would unify Nigeria and safeguard the lives and property of the Igbo and other Nigerians wherever they live in the country.\n\n\u201cThe roads he built in Anambra 16 years ago are still intact. There is no Igbo man who is his match. He is one of the Igbo leaders that will call us whenever there is a problem in the North. He has the fear of God.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAlso speaking, Ezeudo of Abuja, Dr Uche Egenti, described Ngige as a bold, courageous and brave man, expressing confidence that if given the opportunity to serve as president, he would replicate his excellent performance in Anambra State in Nigeria.\n\nEarlier while consulting the group on his presidential ambition, Ngige reaffirmed his belief in one united, fair, equitable and just Nigeria, saying that the Igbo have property scattered across the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe said that the president of Nigeria should be for the most competent person irrespective of where he or she comes from.\n\n\u201cThe president is for all, but certain areas in the constitution, particularly Section 14 (3) said that the government of Nigeria must be dominated by persons from different groups and no one group should dominate in other to command national loyalty and patriotism.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we believe in unity and diversity. We believe in justice, equity and fair play, to the extent that today, our party, APC, has said that the next president should come from the people of Southern stock of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo of the Southeast are part of Southern Nigeria. Some of us have taken the pains to serve our country for the past 40 years in the public service of Nigeria. I started my journey as medical officer 1 at the National Assembly clinic in Lagos. From there, I went into the Federal Ministry of Health and rose to become consultant and later, Deputy Director in charge of Hospital Services. I left the civil service without blemish and became a party official in the PDP. Working with former Vice President, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we conceded presidency to the Southwest in 1999 and General Olusegun Obasanjo became president. I was among those who made it possible for the unity of the country. The party conscripted me to become governor in Anambra State. Obasanjo stayed 1999 to 2007 and afterwards, the presidency moved to the North and Yar\u2019Adua who was my mate as governor became president.\n\n\u201cThose who are from Anambra here know what I did in the state as governor in just 34 months. I didn\u2019t do for Anambra alone, but for the entire Southeast.\u201d\n\nNgige recalled that his administration in Anambra State executed 105 road projects traversing the entire 21 local government areas of Anambra State and linking neighbouring states of Imo, Abia and Enugu.\n\nHe said that Anambra people rewarded him with a seat at the Senate where he represented Anambra Central and they made good laws for the country, such as the 2013 Health Act he made in collaboration with Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, the incumbent Delta State governor.\n\nNgige said that he has been Minister of Labour and Employment for two terms since in 2015 and has been labouring in the labour room ever since, attending to labour disputes from ASUU, doctors and other unions, so that things would continue moving.\n\n\u201cI am doing all these as your ambassador, trying to represent the Igbo well. I think I have done well. Now, we are talking about the president of Nigeria. President Muhamnadu, my friend, has worked for Nigeria. But, no one man will finish every work. His tenure is coming to an end. I have told him that those who will replace him are those who understand what is being said, to ensure that we execute our programmes 100 per cent. I don\u2019t have money, but I know I have the capacity to do the job. I am still consulting and will take a decision by Easter. Being a good Christian, I have committed everything to God.\u201d",

          "title": "Search for Consensus Presidential Candidate in PDP Falters, Atiku Insists on Primary Election",
          "text": "\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe quest by some presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a consensus flagbearer for the party ahead of their Presidential primaries is looking more like a fruitless mission, with former vice president Atiku Abubakar and two others (Dele Momodu and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa) insisting that all aspirants must face the party\u2019s delegates in \u201cdemocratic primary election.\n\n\u201dThe four aspirants in the forefront of the campaign for consensus \u2013 former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and the former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, Mohammed Hayatudeen \u2013 have been crisscrossing the country in the last few weeks, promoting the consensus flagbearer idea. Only last Wednesday, the pro-consensus aspirants led by Saraki met with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, where the issue of consensus flagbearer topped the agenda and strategies for actualising the mission mapped out.\n\nWike, while speaking after the meeting, said their interest was to ensure the consolidation of unity in the party.He said they were developing a formidable strategy that would enable the PDP coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election. Atiku was, however, absent from the meeting. The pro-consensus presidential aspirants had earlier met with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the issue.\n\nA source close to the former vice president told THISDAY last night that Atiku would never be part of any consensus arrangement for the presidential ticket of the PDP. The source said some of the pro-consensus presidential aspirants, led by Saraki, met with Atiku in his house in Abuja last week and that the former vice president told them bluntly that what they were pushing for was undemocratic, can\u2019t work and that he would never be part of it.\n\nAtiku was said to have advised that all aspirants should go and face the party\u2019s delegates at the National Convention. Another source close to the former vice president told THISDAY: \u201cThe push for consensus is by people aiming to shut out a particular aspirant. Are they saying the 13 aspirants that took forms would sit down and pick one of them as the consensus flagbearer? Does this make sense? Who will step down for who? The aspirants should be meeting and selling their ideas to delegates; not meeting over consensus candidate. That is the position of Atiku.\n\n\u201dNewspaper publisher and another presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu told THISDAY last night that the move for consensus PDP flagbearer was dead on arrival.Momodu stated: \u201cI see a very dangerous kind of desperation in our career politicians in Nigeria as our country prepares for the 2023 Presidential election. It is unfortunate that some of our leaders are toying with the hard-fought democracy most of them were never part of.\n\n\u201cAt a time our country is at its worst state in decades, career politicians are only interested in hijacking power for themselves and are totally disinterested in engaging the electorates on how they plan to rescue our country and its long-suffering people from the brink of total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe concept of consensus as practised in Nigeria is anathema to democracy because it is based on everything that democracy is not. It denies merit, enshrines illegality and enthrones mediocrity. Moreover, it embraces corruption, bullying and other unseen ills and threats.\n\nHow are the proponents of consensus different from President Muhammadu Buhari who has virtually taken over the control of APC as the Alpha & Omega? \u201cHow will they enforce their consensus on someone like me when I have bought my nomination form and I\u2019m ready to contest all the way? They should please conserve and preserve their energies and let the people make their choices in a free and fair contest. That is the essence of democracy.\n\nWe need to save hapless Nigerians from this unnecessary distraction.\u201dAnother PDP Presidential aspirant, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa questioned the principles that would govern the choice of a consensus presidential candidate being promoted.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I see Bukola Saraki moving round the country canvassing for a PDP consensus Presidential candidate, he reminds me of his father many years ago, moving round the country saying it was the turn of the North to present a Presidential candidate.\u201cHowever, what are the principles governing the choice of a consensus Presidential candidate? It is worth consideration when consensus is anchored on the principle of equity, justice and fair play, not the brow beaten saga, which APC was compelled to submit to by Mr. President recently.\n\nConsensus should not approximate to an arm twisting scenario or drama.\u201cWhy is the talk of consensus at this time when the clamour for a Nigerian President of Southeast extraction has gained critical mass at the national level? Someone brought the idea of this consensus to my attention, to buy into it. When 10 people are contesting or vying for a position, you don\u2019t exclude nine to the advantage of one person. Consensus must be a collective decision of all those involved in this game. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with Makinde, Okowa\n\nAt the PDP pro-consensus presidential aspirants meeting with Makinde, the governor said the party would work to ensure the success of a consensus presidential candidate arrangement for the PDP. \u201dWe have discussed behind closed doors the issue of the consensus arrangements we are trying to put together. We did it at the last convention of our party, and that was the first time the PDP was able to achieve bringing in a national chairman for the party through a consensus arrangement,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nAt the meeting with Makinde, Saraki declared: \u201cOf course, we all have our individual interests to become the president, but we have decided in our meetings that we are ready to subject ourselves to a consensus arrangement. It is not just for one part of the country, but for the PDP as a party.\u201dAt another meeting with Okowa, Saraki also made a case for consensus candidate: \u201cThis is important because we believe that the country needs unity.\n\nWe are all eminently qualified to lead this country but we believe that only one person will lead and that person needs everybody to make Nigeria better and to fix this country.\u201dThe former governor of Kwara stated that the interest of the aspirants was second to that of the country, adding, \u201cThis also goes to show that this consensus arrangement is not just about the issue of the North but about Nigeria.\n\n\u201dSaraki said any of them is qualified to lead the country and that they had agreed to a consensus arrangement to elect the party\u2019s presidential flagbearer.Also, Saraki, during a consultative visit to Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State last month, said some of the PDP presidential aspirants from the north were ready for a consensus candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is only one person that will lead this country in 2023; and we also resolved that we are going to work closely to ensure that we come out with a way that consensus arrangement would come among the three of us on how to go forward into leading this country.\u201dThe aspirants that have purchased the PDP presidential forms are Atiku, Saraki, Wike, Anyim Pius Anyim, Governor Mohammed, Governor Tambuwal, Hayatudeen and Dele Momodu.\n\nOthers are a United States based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa and an unknown politician from Imo State, Mrs. Oliver Tareila Diana.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Meanwhile, the court has fixed May 18 to deliver ruling in Kanu\u2019s application for bail.The court fixed the date after listening to arguments for and against granting the application.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, in moving the bail application said: \u201cUntil a person is tried and convicted, he should be allowed to walk free.\u201dHe reminded the court that a defendant ought to enjoy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cI humbly urge my lord to use your discretion to grant him bail subject to my lord\u2019s condition,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can limit him to stay in my house and I will not allow him to move around,\u201d the lawyer added jokingly.Responding, prosecution counsel, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to refuse the application, adding that Kanu had allegedly violated the earlier bail granted him.\n\n\u201cMy lord granted him bail in 2017 on health grounds, but since then until date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.\u201dHe urged the judge to be guided by her discretion vis-a-vis the circumstances of the case \u201cand in the alternative, order accelerated hearing on this matter so that the defendant can know his fate one way or the other.\n\n\u201dIn a short ruling, the judge announced May 18 to deliver the ruling on the bail application.The IPOB leader was arraigned last year on an amended criminal charge, shortly after he was arrested and repatriated to Nigeria.He had fled the country in 2017 after soldiers invaded his family house in Abia State and was reported to have committed most of the alleged offences from his hideout somewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter he was repatriated and arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to the 15-count amended charges bordering on alleged treasonable felony and asked the court to quash the charges for being defective and baseless, adding that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him based on those charges.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: InfraCo to Unlock N8 trillion Pension Funds\u2019 Assets for Deployment to Bankable Infrastructure Projects Across Nigeria",
          "text": "\n\n*Signs terms sheet with four asset managers\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday announced that the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) would unlock N8 trillion of pension funds\u2019 assets to be deployed into bankable infrastructure projects across Nigeria. Emefiele also announced the appointment of Mr. Lazarus Angbazo as Chief Executive Officer of InfraCo and signed terms agreement with four Infrastructure Asset Managers \u2013 the AAA Consortium, Chapel Hill Denham, Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers and Sanlam Infra works.\n\nInfracorp is being promoted by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, with KPMG as transaction advisers. Also, with their Legal Advisers \u2013 Kenna Partners, Olaniwun Ajayi, and Ukiri and Lijadu \u2013 they are to deliver InfraCo as a catalyst to accelerate public-private solutions for infrastructure in Nigeria, with initial capital raising of N15 trillion. At a press briefing in Lagos yesterday, Emefiele said:\n\n\u201cWe have done our scoping, we believe that a substantial portion of the N15 trillion is available locally. There is a lot of liquidity today not just in the banking industry; there is a lot of liquidity that is currently held by our pension funds managers. I understand from the last count that the size of Nigeria pension fund is over N13 trillion. I am told that in another three to five years, Nigerian pension assets would rise to almost N20 trillion to N25 trillion.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of local capital and liquidity in Nigeria and what we would like to say is that we would begin by talking to people, the institutions that have this liquidity to come in and take up this kind of debt and that is why I am trying to say that out of the N14 trillion that will be debt, we imagine that on looking at it on a straight line, we should be looking at N8- N9 trillion available say within the Nigerian banking industry and the pension fund administrators.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, naturally the rest will be raised through foreign debt like Eurobond and the rest of them. So, yes, there will be Eurobond, but because we are moving very quickly, very fast, we will be looking at more in Nigeria.\u201cSo, let\u2019s not forget these are projects from viability stand points and that they will be generating Naira revenue. Most of the roads will be carrying the traffic cam, they will be tolled but we will try as much as possible to ensure that the tolls are not too high and become so burdensome on the road users.\n\n\u201cThe important thing I think is we must begin to come to a realisation that for us to have good infrastructure, for us to have good roads, we will need to make them commercially viable and that means we have to really pay for them.\u201dFurther speaking on how InfraCo would be financed, Emefiele said the first phase of this financing is to raise N14 trillion debt plus N1 trillion equity which is being contributed by the CBN, AFC and NSIA. He added: \u201cUpon signing the terms sheet today, we will go straight into execution mode because Nigeria very badly needs to develop its infrastructure.\n\nThere is infrastructure deficit in the public sector, there is infrastructure deficit in the private sector and we would like to see that we played our part at this time to support the efforts of not just the government but also the private sector in doing whatever can be done to develop infrastructure in Nigeria. \u201cWe are determined to do this because we all travel to different parts of the world and we see state of the development of their infrastructure and indeed most of the developing countries that we like to compare ourselves with also have some sort of our type of InfraCo and that is why they have moved very aggressively in developing infrastructure in those countries.\n\nWe are determined to see to it that from today InfraCo is open for business.\u201cFrom today we are unveiling InfraCo to Nigeria and because we are sure, we are confident that the funding of N15 trillion is available.\u201cIn other countries where infrastructure corporations have worked, pension funds have been used to develop the infrastructure of those countries.\n\n\u201cEmerging market economies have used private sector funds coming from either pension fund managers or the banking industry to set an example that we here in Nigeria stand ready to support infrastructure development, to support the government in the development of Nigeria infrastructure, and that is our solemn pledge today that we will.\n\nI am so sure that with the gap in the Nigerian infrastructure, this is the first tranche and I believe it will soon very quickly be used up and we can now go to a phase two and phase three.\u201cNigeria as the biggest economy in Africa and a country with the largest population in Africa truly deserves that at this time. Its infrastructure must be top notch so as to continue to encourage investors both locally and foreign to have confidence to come and do business in Nigeria.\u201dOn his part, Angbazo said:\n\n\u201cThe specific mission of InfraCo is to harness opportunities for infrastructure development in Nigeria by originating, structuring, executing and managing end-to-end bankable projects. These projects would be managed privately by asset managers that are private entities and they would do this in partnership with public and private sector participants to provide long and attractive investment returns required not just in terms of financial returns but also in terms of social impact.\u201d\u201cInfraCo is a dedicated vehicle to unlock and enable development of infrastructure.\n\nIt is a catalyst to unlock private capital by leveraging local and international pools of capital and finally it is an enabler for economic growth and development by driving local capacity building, inclusive growth and development with impact.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Hytch succeed where GoMyWay failed?",
          "text": "At the end of October 2018, the Nigerian ride-sharing platform GoMyWay ceased to exist after operating for about 4 years. According to a statement by the company\u2019s CEO Damilola Teidi, this was due to a lack of follow-on funding, as its investors had decided not to continue backing the company.\n\nIt was a surprising event, owing to the promise of the business at launch. Within its first month of launch, it announced that it would quickly expand into Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. A pan-African expansion within launch month is unusual, but the calibre of investors\u2014Konga founder and CEO Sim Shagaya, and Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino\u2014on the startup\u2019s capital table somewhat made the possibility considerable. Though the expansion didn\u2019t eventually happen, the prospect of it happening, however, was an indication that the business was meeting its projection.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4 years since anybody last used GoMyWay, and another startup is ready to take up the challenge of scaling digital vehicle-pooling in Nigeria. Founded by Laolu Onifade, Hytch Africa was launched to the public last month\u2014after months of public building and teasing its internet community with product videos and pictures\u2014to help people share rides and move faster and cheaper.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLike GoMyWay, Hytch has also begun to ramp up users. The company announced, on its social media platforms, that it had acquired 600 users in just 3 days, with zero spend on marketing. Its CEO also tweeted that they are looking to get 2,000 users by the end of the second quarter.\n\nGoMyWay, before it went into oblivion, had said it had over 12,000 users and had completed 106,630 rides across 16 states in Nigeria. But how the 2 startups acquired users is different. While the defunct company ran free services, accompanied by giveaways, like offering car owners one month\u2019s supply of fuel, Onifade told TechCabal that Hytch hasn\u2019t spent a kobo on user acquisition.\n\nBusiness model is king\n\nGoMyWay had traction but wasn\u2019t making money. According to Teidi\u2019s statement, the plan by its shareholders and investors was to run a free service for a year or 2, then focus on growing the user base. So, there was traction with zero revenue and no way to monetise the business.\n\nFor Hytch, the opposite is the case as they want to make money as they go, and are already doing so. \u201cWe are already making money. We charge 15% on every ride and, since launch, we\u2019ve recorded an average of 25 rides daily,\u201d Onifade told TechCabal.\n\nLaolu Onifade, founder and CEO at Hytch\n\nHytch operates a cashless payment method and it provides an inbuilt wallet for both drivers and riders, and riders are automatically debited at the end of every trip they take.\n\nGoMyWay and others like Ridebliss, another local carpooling service that\u2019ve since failed, are great learning references for Hytch. Hytch, in a bid to capture the vehicle-pooling market, allows not just carpooling, but bus-pooling; buses can pick up people going their way. This means that public bus owners can also use the platform to get riders daily.\n\n\u201cHytch is not just for private car owners; there is a bus-pooling option as well,\u201d Onifade said.\n\nRide-sharing is essential\n\nVehicle-pooling is not new to people: globally, it\u2019s one common way for people to move from one place to another, hitching rides with an unknown driver at random locations or bus stops. What if this same experience can be digitised?\n\nThis is the question companies like Hytch are answering.\n\nDifferent ride-hailing companies are currently trying to incorporate ride-sharing into their product. Last year, Uber in Kenya was reported to be testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey. They have plans to roll out the service to Ghana and Nigeria. The company first introduced the service to its San Francisco market, and it was reported to be a success until the pandemic forced its pause.\n\nAnother disturbing factor is that the ride-hailing sector\u2014even though it\u2019s not the most-funded tech sector\u2014requires a lot of capital to scale. At least that\u2019s what the top companies have done and made the world believe is best practice: burn heavy cash to acquire users. Bolt recently raised $607 million in a Series F round; Uber raised a total of $25.2 billion over 33 rounds before it IPOed in 2019; and even French BlaBlaCar, which is primarily doing the same thing as Hytch, has raised more than $443 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006 (its recent funding of $115 million came in April last year).\n\nFor now, it looks like the company has learnt a great deal from the defunct startups in the sector and may be well on its way to success. But it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nOnifade believes that his company has the skill and drive to build the product and a business model that works but do they have the money needed to fully build? Per investment, the CEO said they have raised a family-and-friends\u2019 round and are currently raising pre-seed.\n\nShare this article",

Last month, Microsoft launched a new office for its African Development Centre in Lagos, it\u2019ll house the company\u2019s product engineering, ecosystem development and innovation teams. In 2021, Huawei also announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia.\n\nIn Kenya, organisations such as Cisco and Philips also run similar innovation studios in Nairobi, while the Kenyan government is building a technology city, Konza City, to drive innovation in the country.\n\nThe launch of Visa\u2019s first African innovation studio and others serves as a boost to the African tech ecosystem as it\u2019ll encourage the creation, development, and implementation of novel ideas.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nCounselling Awareness Month is observed in the United States in April. Today, Friday, April 8, 2022, is Teal Day. Everyone is encouraged to wear teal \u2013 a dark greenish-blue colour \u2013 to support the nationwide effort to raise counsellor awareness and promote mental health.\n\nWhile we are not in the US, I believe now is an excellent time to sensitise you on the importance of counselling.\n\nSo, what is counselling? Counselling \u2013 also known as therapy \u2013 is a therapeutic approach that focuses on a client\u2019s emotional and intellectual experience: how they feel and what they think about the issue for which they have sought help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there is a widespread misconception that therapy is only for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. This is wrong; people seek therapy for various reasons, including discussing their lives and emotional upheavals, resolving conflicts, healing from trauma, and having a safe space to talk with someone who is not a part of their personal life.\n\nCounselling can offer immediate solutions and support. It\u2019s a collaborative effort between the client and the counsellor to clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nMost importantly, it isn\u2019t a waste of time because talking about your problem helps you feel better. So, why not give therapy a shot? While you\u2019re thinking about it, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nNIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\nUnrelated, but an update is needed. Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form.\n\nIs the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat appeared to be an order that would never be carried out due to its deadline extension is now in effect. That came unexpectedly!\n\nWhat is the gist? On Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) cards not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nFollowing the continuous extension of deadlines, one might have concluded that the government wasn\u2019t serious about the NIN-SIM linkage. To put things in perspective, the deadline has been extended NINE times.\n\nThe initial January 19, 2021 deadline was pushed back to February 9, April 6, May 6, June 30, July 26, October 31, December 31, and finally, March 31, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the minister, the March 31, 2022 extension was granted in response to requests from stakeholders, including citizens, legal residents, and Nigerians in the diaspora. He also revealed that 71 million Nigerians had obtained their NIN, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN.\n\nAs the famous phrase goes, \u201ceverything that has a beginning has an ending.\u201d I think we might have come to the end of the SIM-NIN-linkage deadline extension. B-but could this really be it?\n\nI mean, won\u2019t some stakeholders and Nigerians in the diaspora file an appeal, given that only 125 million subscribers had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification, and authentication when the order was issued?\n\nMoreover, as of February 2022, Nigeria had 197,768,482 active mobile subscribers across all networks, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator.\n\nGiven that a single subscriber has more than two lines registered to their name, it appears that approximately 37 million telecom subscribers across networks have been affected.\n\nInterestingly, yesterday, April 7, 2022, at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, a crowd gathered at the gate, with issues ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. Nonetheless, it appears that a larger number were there to register for their NINs.\n\nTechpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm the situation but encountered some unpleasant scenes. For an in-depth look at the drama, please read here: NIN-SIM linkage: Worrying scenes at NIMC office, as the Nigerian government directs telcos to block defaulting subscribers\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to careers, most countries consider full-time work to be the norm. And if you don\u2019t have a 9-5, in some cases, you aren\u2019t regarded as employed and unlikely to be treated with respect. Also, if you appear younger than your age \u2013 as I do \u2013 know that you\u2019re just another adolescent on the street.\n\nAs an example, last year, a 200-level medical student approached me. To them, I was just another student in class 9 (JSS3). This might surprise you, but I get things like that or related to it, and they can be amusing or humiliating.\n\n2020 heralded a new era where the world transitioned to remote work, with COVID-19 leading to an increase in informal employment through digital platforms and innovation, thereby boosting the gig economy.\n\nConsequently, the gig economy in Africa has grown significantly, serving as a temporary measure for consumers when businesses closed during the lockdowns and providing employment for those who are excluded from formal and even informal opportunities.\n\nFor context on the gig economy in Africa, please, read: The gig economy is a big boost, but still a different story in Africa\n\nWhile the gig economy is growing, per research, gig workers in Africa do not have access to certain financial services. And ImaliPay, a \u201cone-stop-shop financial services platform,\u201d claims it addresses this issue.\n\nFounded in late 2020 by Tatenda Furusa and Oluwasanmi Akinmusire, the platform which provides financial services to ride-hailing companies to drive productivity has announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round in debt and equity.\n\nImaliPay, which is already present in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, will use the funds to expand its 50-person team, improve its technology, and expand into new markets such as Ghana and Egypt.\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing The Folklore Group\u2019s $1.7 million pre-seed announcement yesterday, Thursday, April 7, 2022, the company also revealedf a shift from business-to-consumer (B2C) to business-to-business (B2B) wholesale.\n\nDo you know what B2B and B2C are? If you don\u2019t, please, read this: B2B vs B2C Ecommerce: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThe funding round was led by Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles-based Venture Capital firm focused on early-stage technology investments, with participation from the Fearless Fund and other notable Black angel investors, including WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike.\n\nFounded by Amira Rasool (CEO) in 2018, the e-commerce company previously sourced, shipped, and did last-mile delivery to customers in 20 countries, including the US. However, that didn\u2019t allow it to grow quickly enough.\n\nWhat changed? A surge in demand for the fashion and lifestyle items the company sold accelerated the startup\u2019s transition to B2B wholesale. Now called Folklore Connect, the company will connect luxury fashion brands in emerging markets with bulk retailers in North America and, later, Europe.\n\nThe company is also launching a new marketplace for fashion brands or platforms to become affiliate partners and The Folklore Edit, an online media site that will feature fashion stories.\n\nThe CEO claims that the Folklore Group is opening up new markets for luxury and emerging brands from Africa and worldwide while also meeting the growing demand from retailers who value diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\neLimu (CcHub) is hiring a mid-level Game Developer.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 4, 2022, after nine deadline extensions, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government directed all telcos to block Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards that have not been linked National Identity Numbers (NIN) from making outgoing calls. A decision that seems to have spurred Nigerians into action.\n\nAt the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters, Alausa, Lagos State, today, April 7, 2022, a crowd gathered at the gate, with problems ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. However, it appears that a larger number were there to enrol for their NINs.\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) ordered all mobile subscribers to link their NINs to their SIM cards. People without NINs were to quickly register or risk being blocked by December 30, 2021.\n\nA decision that seemed questionable, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have your NIN, linking your SIM to your NIN is relatively seamless and can be done by dialling a code specific to your telecom provider or by calling customer care.\n\nHowever, going by the unhappy crowd at NIMC\u2019s office, the prospect of a NIN-SIM linkage could still be a long way off for some people.\n\nTechpoint Africa embarked on a little trip to confirm the situation but met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were on the ground to disperse the crowd. It took over 45 minutes to make it across the gate, even when we had an ID card with PRESS boldly written on it.\n\nUsing forceful methods for crowd control, the Civil Defence Corps flogged Nigerians in the crowd. Sadly, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, also received a few strokes and a shove on the chest from the trigger-happy corps member.\n\nWhips and batons are used in riots and other violent situations. However, for a civil action like registering for a national identity, we find it worrying that whips, and not more humane solutions, are the preferred method for crowd control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn NSCDC member using a whip on Techpoint journalist\n\nUnnecessary NIN-SIM linkage crowds\n\nA lady at the scene confirmed that her SIM had been banned from making calls. While she could receive calls and use the Internet, she has been unable to make any calls since Monday.\n\nAccording to another lady, she has been coming to the NIMC office since the directive was given on Monday and has not been able to move past the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince Monday, there has been a crowd here. I\u2019ve been coming since Monday.\u201d\n\nA glance at the NIMC website reveals that these crowds and the ensuing whipping by Civil Defense staff could have been significantly avoided.\n\nInterestingly, one of our reporters, who had two of his SIMs blocked was able to quickly remedy this after dialing the respective NIN-SIM linkage codes for both service providers. One of his network providers is yet to block him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the NIMC compound. Some of these people have been here since Monday\n\nFrom the lady\u2019s explanation, she went to an agent enterprise to enrol for her NIN, had received her NIN, and linked it to her SIM. However, she has not been able to make calls since Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use money and to do it in another place, when you bring it, they will say that one is fake,\u201d she said.\n\nNIMC licenses these agents to serve as registration centres for enrolment and retrieval, among other things.\n\nHowever, going by the lady\u2019s story, even people who have registered and gotten their NIN are also affected.\n\nWe also noticed that people who lost their SIMs and had to retrieve them also faced the same predicament. Even though they had valid NINs already linked to the lost line.\n\nHow to validate your NIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the crowd at the NIMC office\n\nPeople in the lady\u2019s predicament and those in the latter situation have to go through a separate process called validation.\n\nSpeaking to staff within the compound concerning validation, we could not glean much.\n\n\u201cYou come here and validate,\u201d the staff said.\n\nWhen asked if it was a new process, she answered in the affirmative. \u201cIt\u2019s better to validate immediately you register.\u201d\n\nApparently, the validation process is usually done along with enrolment, which some people might have skipped for some reasons (including going through backdoors?); having your NIN might not be enough as it may be inactive.\n\nYou can solve this problem using the NIMC app, but you have to make sure to use the number connected to your NIN as you would receive a one-time password.\n\nDear Applicants,\n\n\n\nFor NIN Validation:\n\n\n\n1. Download the NIMC Mobile App\n\n2. Insert your NIN on the App\n\n3.

Therefore, the decision to block people from making calls is discriminatory, and a travesty.\n\n\u201cThe decision will cause a wide variety of harms to economic activity, personal safety, and disproportionately affect those on the margins of society. This will directly hinder the ability of the government to achieve the 2030 Agenda\u2019s Goal 8 on the promotion of sustained, inclusive, sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians including persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, persons living in remote areas have been unable to capture their biometrics, and obtain their National Identity Numbers [NINs] due to logistical challenges, administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the persistent collapse of the national grid.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in the discrimination of marginalized or vulnerable groups.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the decision to block people from making calls on their SIMs is reversed within 48 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions in the public interest to ensure full compliance with human rights standards.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and freedom of association, whether offline or online promote the democratic ideal by allowing citizens to voice their concerns, challenge governmental institutions, and hold government accountable for its actions.\n\n\u201cThe democratic ideal rationale also recognizes the necessity of having a well-informed citizenry to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cWe support any lawful means to address the growing insecurity across the country. However, while the authorities have a legal responsibility to protect, ensure and secure the rights to life and property, any such responsibility ought to be discharged in conformity with human rights standards.\u201d",

Members of Mr Khan\u2019s party (PTI) left the building, insisting he was the victim of an international conspiracy.\n\nOpposition parties were able to secure 174 votes in the 342-member house in support of the no-confidence motion, the house speaker said, making it a majority vote.\n\nIn a tweet, opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan and its parliament were \u201cfinally freed from a serious crisis\u201d.\n\nMr Sharif added: \u201cCongratulations to the Pakistani nation on a new dawn.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan said the 69-year-old walked out of his prime ministerial residence \u201cgracefully and he didn\u2019t bow down\u201d.\n\nThe senator went on to say that Mr Khan had \u201clifted the entire nation\u201d.\n\nThe former captain of Pakistan\u2019s national cricket team was elected prime minister in 2018, and promised to fight corruption and fix the economy.\n\nBut those pledges have gone unmet with the country gripped by a financial crisis.\n\nIn late March a series of defections deprived him of his majority and left him fighting for his political career.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Secunder Kermani says Mr Khan is widely regarded as having come to power with the help of Pakistan\u2019s army, but now observers say they have fallen out.\n\nMr Khan has repeatedly said that Pakistan\u2019s opposition parties are working with foreign powers. He also claims that he is the target of a US-led conspiracy to remove him because of his refusal to stand with Washington on issues against Russia and China.\n\nThe US has said there was \u201cno truth\u201d in these allegations, and Mr Khan has never provided any evidence.\n\nHe visited Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin as Russia was launching the invasion of Ukraine and has previously criticised what the Bush administration called the war on terror.",

          "text": "Christians across Nigeria and the world are marking Palm Sunday, signalling the beginning of the Holy Week.\n\nThe day symbolises the entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem where he triumphantly rode on a donkey a week before his resurrection. The event is recounted in each of the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\n\nMany Christian faithful made small crosses from palms to celebrate the day and some churches also held processions, reenacting Christ\u2019s entry into Jerusalem.\n\nThe palm branches, for most Christians, signify goodness and victory. Palm Sunday is the last week of the Lent season that precedes Easter.\n\nIn several churches in the country, messages were centred on the lessons from the event. In his message, Pope Francis called for an Easter truce in Ukraine to pave the way for peace through \u201creal negotiations\u201d.\n\n\u201cMay an Easter ceasefire begin but not to reload arms and resume combat. No. A ceasefire to arrive at peace through real negotiations,\u201d he told a public mass at Saint Peter\u2019s Square.\n\n\u201cLet the Easter truce begin. But not to provide more weapons and pick up the combat again \u2014 no! \u2014 a truce that will lead to peace, through real negotiation.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff denounced a war where \u201cdefenceless civilians\u201d suffered \u201cheinous massacres and atrocious cruelty\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat victory is there in planting a flag on a pile of rubble?\u201d he asked.\n\nFrancis on Wednesday had already condemned the targeting of civilians in Ukraine, calling the discovery of bodies in Bucha near Kyiv a \u201cmassacre\u201d and embracing a Ukrainian flag from the \u201cmartyred town\u201d.\n\nHe has also expressed his willingness to contribute to halting the fighting in Ukraine and said he would be ready to travel to Kyiv.\n\nRussia has denied responsibility for the apparent killings of civilians in Bucha, accusing Ukraine of staging them. Moscow has not provided any evidence to back up its claim.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to unblock millions of unregistered lines.\n\nJust last week, the Federal Government directed telecommunication companies in the country to bar all outgoing calls on unlinked lines from Monday, April 4, 2022. Unlinked lines are Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMS) not yet registered and linked with the National Identification Number (NIN) by users.\n\nWhile reacting to the ban via a statement issued on Sunday, SERAP asked President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cdirect the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to immediately reverse the apparently unlawful decision to block over 72 million active telecommunication subscribers from making calls on their SIMs\u201d.\n\n\u201cBlocking people from making calls undermines their ability to communicate freely, and associate with others. It infringes their rights to freedom of expression and family life, as well as socio-economic rights,\u201d SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare said.\n\nREAD ALSO: NIN: Millions At Risk As FG Orders Telcos To Bar Outgoing Calls On Unlinked SIMs\n\nWhile noting that the decision will have a chilling effect, dissuading the free expression of ideas and information, SERAP argued that the move is inconsistent and incompatible with the country\u2019s international legal obligations to respect, protect, promote and facilitate economic and social rights. The decision contradicts the tenets of the rule of law and democratic society, it said.\n\n\u201cImmediately reversing the decision would be in conformity with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations. Reversing the decision would also improve the confidence of the international community in human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe decision will cause a wide variety of harms to economic activity, and personal safety, and disproportionately affect those on the margins of society. This will directly hinder the ability of the government to achieve the 2030 Agenda\u2019s Goal 8 on the promotion of sustained, inclusive, sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians including persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, persons living in remote areas have been unable to capture their biometrics, and obtain their National Identity Numbers [NINs] due to logistical challenges, administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the persistent collapse of the national grid,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has announced his interest to contest the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe made the announcement on Saturday while addressing a crowd of supporters and leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at an event in Port Harcourt.\n\nAmaechi was giving a speech titled, \u2018Forward With Courage\u2019 at a thanksgiving service held at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium in the Rivers State capital.\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, I stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next president,\u201d he declared to the cheers of hundreds of party faithful at the event. \u201cI did not come to this decision lightly, I have served our nation for the last seven years as minister of transportation.\n\n\u201cEight years before that, I served as governor of Rivers State; in the preceding eight years before that, I was Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly. With in this period, I have also served as the Director-General of President (Muhammadu) Buhari\u2019s campaign organisation twice.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Soludo Swears In 20 Commissioners, Says Anambra People Expect Excellence\n\nThe minister believes his 23 years of service in various capacities have equipped him with great experience in governance and public service.\n\nHe added that the period has afforded him the opportunity to show compassion for the ordinary citizens of the country.\n\n\u201cAfter more than two decades in the public arena, I had wanted to go on a holiday and spend more time with my family before charting a new course outside politics, but at 56 \u2026 I am compelled by the urgency of our present challenges to place my experience and proven capacity at the service of the nation at the highest level,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nSome of the party chieftains at the event include Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nOthers include the Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, as well as former governors and lawmakers elected on the platform of the ruling party.\n\nWith his declaration, Amaechi is expected to vie for the APC presidential ticket alongside former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu; Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, among others at the party\u2019s primary.\n\nRead the full text of the minister\u2019s speech below:\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\nI stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next President. I did not come to this decision lightly. I have served our nation for the last seven years as Minister of Transportation.\n\nFor eight years before that, I served as Governor of Rivers State. In the preceding eight years before that, I was Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly. These 23 years of service have equipped me not only with great experience in governance and public service but also compassion for the ordinary citizens of our dear country.\n\nAfter more than two decades in the public arena, I had wanted to go on holiday and spend more time with my family before charting a new course outside politics. But at 58, and a member of the generation born after independence who has seen the good, the bad and the ugly of Nigeria, I am compelled by the urgency of our present challenges to place my experience and proven capacity at the service of the nation at the highest level.\n\nThose who know me can testify that I have always been a straight talker. This trait has not always made me popular, but I speak truth with conviction. So, allow me to speak the truth here today. We are facing some very serious challenges as a country. These are problems of insecurity, challenges of greater accountability in governance, youth unemployment and the scourge of spiralling poverty.\n\nThese problems are however not the exclusive preserve of Nigeria. We live in a troubled world. The reality we used to know has altered in nearly every nation. Climate change has brought about food scarcity in some places. Population explosion has produced unusual pressure on resources and supplies. Poverty has become a challenge all over the world, especially in the developing world.\n\nThe Covid crisis has placed unanticipated burdens on the budgets of nations and put pressure on available resources. Transborder crises have erupted in unusual places and placed the internal security of many nations under pressure. We are part of the Sahel, an area of the world that is subject to frequent terrorist attacks. Let us look at our current challenges as part and consequences of these global trends.\n\nI admit that Nigeria\u2019s problems did not begin today. And they will not be solved overnight. But they are not beyond the capacity of our people to solve. Fortunately, that process has already started. There is an ancient proverb that \u201ca society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they know they\u2019ll never sit.\u201d\n\nThe current administration under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has planted many such trees in Nigeria\u2019s future. We have invested billions in infrastructure, human capital development and made reforms that will pay off over time in terms of socio-economic growth and stability. We have invested heavily in projects and initiatives that will secure a brighter, better future for Nigeria.\n\nI am proud to have been part of this success story. It has been an honour overseeing the Ministry of Transportation in reviving the moribund railways and working tirelessly to create an integrated national transportation system that will positively impact our economy, trade, employment, business, and national cohesion. Have we achieved everything we set out to do? Off-course not. Could we have done more? Undoubtedly, there is always room for improvement.\n\nOn reflection, the notion of running for President would have been far beyond the imagination of the young lad running around the streets of Diobu or our small compound in Ubima. Not to talk of the young indigent student leader, mobilizing peers at the University of Port Harcourt. But my aspiration is not about fulfilling any personal ambition. I am contesting for office because I believe that it is my moral duty to give what I can in the service of my country.\n\nTo sustain and intensify present efforts at solving our national problems, our democracy must ensure the emergence of a leadership that is equipped with broad experience in governance to ensure stability and continuity. To sustain our democracy and preserve our unity, we need a steady hand and a passion for success in a nation that remains united to pursue prosperity for all Nigerians.\n\nIt is this combination of experience and patriotic passion that I bring to the table. I have been in the political arena for 23 years. I have served at every level of government \u2013 local, state, and federal. I have served both as a political appointee and an elected official. I have served both as an executive \u2013 as Governor of Rivers State and as a legislator \u2013 as Speaker of the State House of Assembly.\n\nIn these capacities, I did not just fill vacant posts. As a Speaker, I managed the legislative process in a difficult transition from military rule. As Governor, I defeated mercantile militancy and restored security. As a minister, I can modestly claim to have justified the trust of Nigerians.\n\nI do not come from a privileged background. I grew up poor. I understand how it feels to go without some meals in a day. I know the pain of lack and the agony of want. I know what it means to see your parents toil just to keep a roof over your family\u2019s head.\n\nI know what it is to feel the weight of expectation when you are are the only one in your family who enjoys the opportunity to attend university. Subsequently, I funded the education of my siblings to be university graduates as well. I know what it is to scrimp and save and struggle.\n\nIn spite of all odds, I have journeyed to this point. I could not have come this far without my parents, Fidelis, and Mary, who sacrificed so much for me. I could not have come this far without the support of my siblings. I could not have come this far without the mentors, friends, and sponsors who have believed in me.\n\nI could not have come this far without the precious wife of my youth and my best friend, Judith, and my children who mean everything to me. I could not have come this far without the support of Dr. Peter Odili and his wife. I could not have come this far without the support of Chief Rufus Ada-George. Neither could I have come this far without the support of President Muhammadu Buhari. Above all, I could not have come this far without the Grace of God.\n\nThe next leg of my political journey will be tough. But I am excited to go out and engage with Nigerians from every walk of life. I am ready to go from Maiduguri to Makurdi, from Sokoto to Sagbama, from Yola to Oyo, from Badagry to Birnin Kebbi. To each town and village, I will have one message: Hope is around the corner.\n\nI look forward to meeting you in your towns, villages, cities, campuses, and creeks. I want to hear your desires, needs and pains. I want to know what matters most to you. I want to listen and learn. I will be coming with one assurance: I will be welcome everywhere because the blood of every Nigerian flow in my veins. I shall be the president of all and every Nigerian.\n\nI believe that despite our cultural differences, we remain one people under God. We may speak different languages or worship in different ways, but we all want the same things \u2013 a better life for our children, the ability to support our families, the freedom to live in peace without fear for our lives or properties.\n\nI have never been the type who folds his arms and complains about inadequacies I see around me. I have always jumped in with both feet to do whatever I can to help, to try and bring relief to those suffering, to work to make things right where I see wrong. If you elect me as your President, I promise to play my part to the best of my ability. Every day I will rise and go to work for you. I will never forget the fact that I am there to serve you.\n\nToday, I stand as an aspirant to the position of President because of that same passion for people; that same drive for results. More than ever before, I am burning with the zeal to make a decisive difference in the lives of all Nigerians.\n\nNo matter the darts and arrows that come my way, I will remain steadfast because the stakes are too high. We cannot afford to fail. We cannot afford to veer off-course.\n\nI pledge my heart, mind and soul to the task of building a Nigeria in which every child can go to school, every young person can find work or support to start a business, every citizen can travel safely around the country and sleep at night knowing that law and order prevails and every Nigerian feels included, heard, and respected.\n\nThe road ahead will be long and arduous. But we go forward with faith.\n\nForward with courage.\n\nForward with compassion.\n\nForward with hope.\n\nForward with pride for who we are as a people and who we are yet to become.\n\nThe future is bright because of YOU.\n\nGod bless you and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nCHIBUIKE ROTIMI AMAECHI",

He had earlier been watch-listed by the commission.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the EFCC spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, accused Obiano of attempting to arm-twist the anti-graft commission with the ex parte order,\n\nIt stated: \u201cAvailable court documents indicate that Obiano had on March 11, 2022, ahead of his handover on March 17 filed a motion ex parte dated March 10, 2022, before Justice Nganjiwa praying among others, for an interim injunction stopping the EFCC from arresting or preventing him from travelling out of the country for his medical treatment.\n\n\u201cWhile the court in one breath ordered the applicant to put the commission on notice on why interim preservatory order should not be granted, it went ahead to make an order that the commission should not obstruct, impede or prevent the applicant from travelling abroad to keep his medical appointment and adjourned till March 23.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, the commission was served an originating motion on notice for the enforcement of the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights. Curiously, the motion was filed on March 11, 2022, the same date as the motion for ex parte order.\n\n\u201cThis was followed by another motion on notice on April 4, putting the commission on notice to release Obiano\u2019s passport to enable him to travel abroad for his medicals with hearing fixed for April 6, and instructions that proceedings shall be conducted virtually via Zoom.\u2019\u2019\n\nAhead of the hearing, the EFCC said it petitioned the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court asking Nganjiwa to recuse himself from the fundamental rights action on the grounds that he is a party in the commission\u2019s appeal at the Supreme Court in the corruption case, H. A. Nganjiwa vs FRN.\n\n\u201cBut when the case was called, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba held the brief of his brother judge, who is bereaved.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has revealed that the terrain where bandits operate contributes to making security operations difficult.\n\nBut human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said Nigerian soldiers can defeat bandits and terrorists if adequate weapons are provided for them to engage the anti-state forces.\n\nThe minister who said this on Saturday during a radio programme on Bond FM, added that the current administration has invested in tackling insecurity, adding that efforts would be more impactful if citizens support government\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are also pleading with Nigerians to join in this fight because they have a lot of roles to play in tackling this insecurity. This is because these criminals called bandits are living among us; they interact with the people as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho are the ones supplying them with food? More so, they also have landlords. People should expose these criminals and then, the various efforts of the government will be effectively complemented and we will see the results.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying our best in the fight against the bandits by equipping our security apparatus. The government has purchased aircraft so that they can fight alongside the soldiers. We have not rested on our oars.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of the police is also given adequate attention and very recently, this administration recruited 25,000 constables and deployed them to their home states. This will go a long way in community policing.\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for the newly-recruited constables to work effectively. There are lots of work in progress in the security infrastructure and personnel.\u201d\n\nThe minister also spoke on the suggestion by the Governor of Kaduna State, on the use of mercenaries to fight bandits.\n\n\u201cGovernor el-Rufai spoke out of a deep concern about the situation. He might have spoken out because of the circumstances at which the bandits are emboldened to operate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf we employ mercenaries to fight the bandits, we should have it at the back of our minds that they are only mercenaries and not our security personnel who will return to wherever after their task is done.\n\n\u201cThe mercenaries cannot be compared with our security forces; the fight against the bandits is a difficult one because of the terrain.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just go with full force to bomb them or else the innocents living around them will be killed and we don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, human rights lawyer, Falana at the weekend said Nigerian soldiers can defeat bandits and terrorists if adequate weapons are provided for them to engage the anti-state forces.\n\nHe expressed this concern after the burial of Kwara State Chairman of Trade Union Congress (TUC), Akinwumi Akinsola, at Ijoko, Ogun State. Akinsola was killed during an attack on a Kaduna-bound train on March 28.\n\nSpeaking on the country\u2019s security challenges, Falana asked Nigerians to dismiss the proposal of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai that foreign mercenaries should be hired to fight insurgents.\n\n\u201cI can say without any fear of contradiction that Nigeria has some of the most patriotic soldiers in the world. All that is missing is appropriate weapons to fight the terrorists who are well-equipped.\n\n\u201cI am speaking from my personal knowledge because I defend top-ranking soldiers \u2013 generals who are charged illegally for demanding weapons to fight terrorists. Troops are prepared to fight, but they are simply saying it is suicidal to face terrorists with inadequate weapons.\u201d\n\nFrankly speaking, according to the senior advocate, Nigerian soldiers are ready to wage counter insurgency operations but they are ill equipped and ill motivated.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have one of the best armed forces in the world but the huge fund earmarked for acquiring military hardware was cornered and stolen by some unpatriotic officers.\u201d\n\nHe, however, lamented that members of the ruling class \u201chave a penchant for diverting the attention of our people from addressing the problems confronting our country.\u201d\n\nHe cited the case of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi recently acknowledged that the Abuja-Kaduna train bomb blast could have been prevented if the security gadgets had been acquired and installed.\n\nHe added that it had been revealed that the minister wanted an incompetent company to be awarded a contract of N3.7 billion to secure the train, which according to him, happened seven months ago.\n\nHe rhetorically said: \u201cWhy did the Minister not recommend another security agency to fix the problem and save precious lives? For goodness sake, why were the Chinese not asked to fix the security gadgets since they constructed the train and the railroad tracks?\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the APC leaders asked President Jonathan to resign on account of the increasing wave of insecurity. Why have the same fellows who have demonstrated worse incompetence not called it quits? Can you imagine that they want terrorists to massacre more passengers?\n\n\u201cWithout installing the much needed security gadgets, the Nigerian Railway Corporation has announced that the Abuja-Kaduna train will resume services in two weeks time. \u201c\n\nAlso after Akinsola\u2019s burial, TUC National President, Quadri Olaleye urged members of the union not to be discouraged despite the death of two members \u2014Musa-Lawal Ozigi, TUC secretary-general, and Akinsola \u2014 in the Kaduna train attack.\n\n\u201cI call on union members to keep the flag flying and continue the struggle. As a trade union, good governance is our goal; that is why we established a programme to ensure stability in the system,\u201d Olaleye said.\n\n\u201cIt was during our national tour that our members were attacked on the Abuja-Kaduna train service. Our comrades lost their lives for a purpose, which is stability and good governance.\u201d\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta",

          "text": "The owners of an oil production and storage ship, Trinity Spirit, had a history of financial problems, amounting to over $200 million, before the vessel blew up in Nigerian waters two months ago, a Bloomberg report has revealed.\n\nAlthough the headship of the company, Shebah Exploration and Production Company, had admitted that the business was \u201cin receivership,\u201d the new investigation has now unravelled how the firm accumulated the humongous debts that led to its eventual collapse.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn its last update, the company had said that three persons out of a possible 10 on board survived the fire, noting that a total of five bodies had been found on or around the vessel.\n\nThe vessel caught fire on February 2, burned for more than 24 hours and left a stain of crude stretching for miles across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhile the cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the Ministry of Environment estimated that up to 60,000 barrels of oil were on board the ship at the time of the blaze.\n\nAccording the report, which documented a trail of the ship, creditors have filed lawsuits against the company operating the vessel, in at least three countries, accusing the firm of defaulting on multiple financial agreements.\n\nThese include two bank loans for a combined $220 million and a contract for the management of the vessel itself, according to court documents and corporate statements.\n\nIt started when a prominent businessman and President of Shebah, Dr. Ambrosie Bryant Orjiako, acted as the personal guarantor of a $150 million loan taken by the company in mid-2012 from the African Export-Import (Afrexim) Bank and two Nigerian lenders to fund a drilling programme on the firm\u2019s oil licence.\n\nShebah leased the vessel from one of its shareholders named Allenne Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands of which Orjiako was a director, according to court filings.\n\nOrjiako is best-known as a founder of Seplat Energy Plc, which has grown since 2009 into Nigeria\u2019s largest independent oil producer and in February agreed to pay $1.3 billion for Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s shallow water assets in the country.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Seplat has no involvement with the Trinity Spirit or any of Shebah\u2019s legal disputes, Orjiako said by email, declining to comment on any matters that are still in court.\n\nHe referred questions regarding the vessel to Shebah Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ikemefuna Okafor, who didn\u2019t respond to emails or calls. Orjiako announced in November that he would step down as Seplat\u2019s Chairman in May.\n\nShebah stopped paying down the Afreximbank loan after meeting a single $6.1 million instalment, according to a lawsuit filed by the lenders in the UK against the company, Allenne and Orjiako.\n\nIn February 2016, a judge ruled that the banks were entitled to $143.9 million, which remains unpaid and has doubled with interest, Afreximbank said in a statement. The banks \u201ccontinue to consider their options for recovery,\u201d Afreximbank said through its law firm, Baker McKenzie.\n\nOrjiako, 61, had argued that delays by Afreximbank in releasing the funding led to drilling contractors either withdrawing or withholding their services, according to a defence he submitted to the London court in September 2015. A UK judge dismissed an appeal by Shebah and Orjiako against the decision in mid-2017.\n\nShebah in 2004 acquired a 40 per cent interest in a permit known as Oil Mining Lease (OML) 108 from ConocoPhillips as Allenne purchased the Trinity Spirit from the Houston-based producer. Shebah agreed to bear all costs in return for 80 per cent of income from the block.\n\nOutput levels wouldn\u2019t return to Conoco\u2019s 20,000 barrels a day from the licence, with no production recorded since 2017, according to data published by Nigeria\u2019s state-owned energy company.\n\nThe government announced in 2019 that it was revoking the permit, without giving reasons. A spokesman for the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the news medium said, didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether the licence was ever withdrawn.\n\nShebah is also under pressure from other creditors. A federal high court in Lagos last year granted Zenith Bank Plc, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest lenders, an injunction preventing selected companies from dealing with Shebah\u2019s assets in a dispute around a $70 million loan provided in 2014 to Orjiako\u2019s firm. Zenith said it doesn\u2019t comment on matters that are in court.\n\nA Houston-based oil services company, Alliance Marine Services, alleged it terminated a contract to manage the Trinity Spirit after Shebah accumulated arrears of $5 million, according to a case filed in a US federal court in 2009.\n\nThe plaintiff said it had also initiated arbitration proceedings in the UK to try recover the money. AMS voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit several months after commencing it and it\u2019s not clear whether the dispute was resolved. Bloomberg was unable to reach AMS.\n\nShebah and two other companies connected to Orjiako were ordered by a UK court in 2020 to pay a Greek shipping company $4.3 million after the trio defaulted on a 2017 agreement to charter a tanker.\n\nIn 2019, a federal high court approved the appointment of a receiver by the state\u2019s debt recovery agency, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), to manage Shebah.\n\nBefore the fire, the oil firm, which is still in receivership, had offered the Trinity Spirit to AMCON to reduce some of its debt and to recover a portion of the loans provided by local lenders in 2012.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has declared that increased diversity of creditors raises coordination challenges for Nigeria and other indebted poor countries.\n\nWith a total public debt of N39.566 trillion ($95.77 billion) as at December 2021, Nigeria is exposed to a significant number of local and external creditors.\n\nIn a blogpost captioned, \u201cRestructuring Debt of Poorer Nations Requires More Efficient Coordination,\u201d the IMF stated that low-income countries face fewer debt challenges today than they did 25 years ago, attributing this in particular to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\u2019 (HIPCs) initiative, which slashed unmanageable debt burdens across sub-Saharan Africa and other regions.\n\nIt observed that although the ratios are lower than in the mid-1990s, debt has been creeping up for the past decade, adding that the changing composition of creditors will make restructuring more complex.\n\nOf the about $39 billion external debt as at December 31, 2021, Nigeria is indebted to bilateral creditors such as China Eximbank, JICA (Japan), AFD of France, GIZ (Germany) and Eximbank of India.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nOn the multilateral side, Nigeria is indebted to the World Bank Group, including the International Development Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).\n\nIt also owes the African Development Bank (AfDB); Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, European Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nThe country\u2019s external debt obligations also extend to Eurobonds and Diaspora Bond.\n\nThe IMF believes that the increasing diversity of creditors poses complex restructuring and more complex challenges for Nigeria and other heavily indebted countries.\n\nIn the blogpost, the global lender noted that an improved common framework for debt treatment could clear a path through an increasingly complex creditor landscape.\n\nAccording to the IMF, in past decades, Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) countries borrowed mainly from Paris Club official creditor nations and private banks, alongside multilateral institutions, adding that today, China and private bondholders play a much larger lending role.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cThe share of DSSI countries\u2019 external debt owed to Paris Club creditors fell from 28 per cent in 2006 to 11 per cent in 2020. Over the same period, the share owed to China rose from 2 per cent to 18 per cent and the share of Eurobonds sold to private creditors increased from three per cent to 11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe situation differs significantly across countries, however. Averages conceal a diversity of debt composition, from the shares of bilateral, multilateral and private creditors, to the composition of official bilateral creditors themselves.\n\n\u201cChina is now the largest official bilateral creditor in more than half of DSSI countries, including when counting all 22 Paris Club creditors as a single pool. China would therefore play a key role in most DSSI countries\u2019 debt restructurings that would involve official bilateral creditors.\n\n\u201cWhile the diversity of creditor compositions calls for greater attention to country specificities, appropriate coordination mechanisms will be key in all cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IMF, putting in place mechanisms that ensure coordination and confidence among creditors and debtors has become urgent, adding that improvements to the G20 Common Framework could play an important role by ensuring broad participation of creditors with fairer burden sharing.\n\n\u201cExperience so far shows that greater clarity on restructuring steps, earlier engagement of official creditors with the debtor and with private creditors, a standstill in debt service payments during negotiations, and specifying the mechanics of comparability of treatment is still needed,\u201d the multilateral institution said.\n\nAlthough Nigeria is one of the 73 eligible countries under the DSSI mooted by the IMF and the World Bank for the G20 nations to defer the debt service obligations of poor countries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country opted out of the initiative.\n\nThe World Bank had explained that although some countries were eligible for the DSSI, they had chosen not to participate for a number of reasons.\n\nSome of the reasons included conveying wrong signals to bondholders and other private creditors, among others.\n\n\u201cSome DSSI-eligible countries have thus far elected not to participate. Currently, 27 DSSI-eligible countries, 37 per cent of eligible countries, are not participating in the initiative for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cSome fear participation may convey the wrong signal to bondholders and other private creditors while others note the amount of eligible bilateral debt service was negligible, and savings do not justify the administrative expenses incurred by the deferral,\u201d the World Bank had stated.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",
