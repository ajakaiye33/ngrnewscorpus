          "title": "Defend yourselves, CAN advises residents as bandits attack Southern Kaduna again",
          "text": "The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria on the state, Rev. John Hayab, described the fresh attack on Southern Kaduna as sad.\n\nSome bandits had raided Agban Kagoro, Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State Sunday night, killed 15 people and burnt houses.\n\nHayab lamented that human beings were killed without adequate protection from the government, urging residents in the area to defend themselves against the bandits.\n\nThe cleric, in a statement, titled, \u2018When will this killing of innocent people in Kaduna stop\u2019, maintained that citizens of the state were tired of the never-ending rhetorics without concrete actions to protect lives and property in the state.\n\nHayab, who is also the Vice-Chairman of CAN in the Northern States, therefore called on citizens to rise up and protect themselves since the government had failed to do so.\n\nHe also called on the state government to swallow its pride and seek genuine help to end the continued killings in the state.\n\nPart of the statement read, \u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria Kaduna State Chapter is sad and grieving following the continued killings, kidnappings, banditry, and the unimaginable evil going on in our state\n\nunabated without any substantial action by the Government and security forces.\n\n\u201cOne only needs to see how human beings are killed and roasted by bandits who attacked Kagoro to conclude that this is one loss too many.\n\n\u201cHow long will this evil continue and when will our leaders act dutifully? Kaduna State citizens are tired of Government\u2019s rhetorical responses without concrete action taken to protect lives and property.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we want to hear and see the killers and kidnappers arrested as the government\u2019s usual media condemnation whenever there is havoc is not good enough.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we appeal to citizens to also wake up and do the needful, protecting their lives and community. When a government fails to protect you, you ought to find a means of defending\n\nyourself.\n\n\u201cFor the records, Kaduna state has lost several lives in the past four years while the leaders scarcely show empathy or concern for the victims seeing that the government\u2019s response is usually in the media. Sadly, the dead cannot read nor listen to the news.\u201d\n\n\u201cCAN, therefore, calls on the Kaduna State Government to swallow her pride and accept that she has failed the people, genuinely seeking help to immediately halt the wanton killings, kidnappings, and terrorist activities going on in the state.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-rufai and his team should focus on the fight to salvage the state so that he will be remembered for good when he leaves office.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Sola Ogundipe\n\nA TOTAL of 112 persons have died of Lassa fever in Nigeria since the beginning of 2022 out of 3,079 cases recorded nationwide, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, revealed over the weekend.\n\nThe NCDC in a report disclsoed that out of the figure, 45 health workers were infected by Lassa fever between January and March. Till date, 87 local government areas across 23 out of the 36 states have reported the disease so far.\n\nAccording to medical experts, Lassa fever is transmitted when the saliva, urine, and excreta of multi-mammalian rats come into contact with humans. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through contact with the body fluids of an infected person. In some cases, Lassa fever has similar symptoms to malaria, appearing between one and three weeks after exposure to the virus. In mild cases, the disease causes fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache.\n\nSecondary transmission from person to person can also occur following exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected patient.\n\nThe NCDC further noted that the predominant age group so far affected by the disease in Nigeria ranged between 21 and 30 years, the disease control agency stated.\n\nThe Agency explained that the animal vector for the Lassa virus, the multimammate rat, is found throughout the west African region, thereby calling on neighboring countries to stay alert on the spread of the Lassa fever.\n\nMeanwhile, NCDC is distributing medical response supplies to states and treatment centers, as part of measures to control the spread of the disease.\n\nFurther findings by NCDC showed that in week 10, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 57 in week 9, 2022 to 33 cases.\n\nThese were reported from Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Kogi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Taraba, Bauchi and Kebbi States (Table 3).\n\n\u201cCumulatively from week 1 to week 10, 2022, 112 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.8 per cent which is lower than the Case fatality rate, CFR, for the same period in 2021 (22.0 percent) In total for 2022, 23 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 87 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).\n\n\u201cOf all confirmed cases, 70% are from Ondo (30%), Edo (24 percent) and Bauchi (16%) States.\n\nThe number of suspected cases has increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2021. It also revealed that no new healthcare workers affected in the reporting week 10.",

          "text": "Awka\u2014Wife of the immediate past Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano has reacted to the altercation between her and the wife of former Biafran warlord, Mrs Bianca Ojukwu.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by her media aide, Chidiebele Obika, \u201cMrs Obiano has expressed shock over the attitude of Amb. Bianca Ojukwu who ostensibly was seen in a viral video when she \u201cslapped\u201d her,albiet unprovoked during the inauguration of Prof. Soludo as the 6th democratically elected Governor of the state on Thursday, March 17, 2022.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, Osodieme recalled that all she did was approach the former beauty queen for their usual friendly banters only to be \u201cslapped\u201d and pushed by Mrs. Bianca Ojukwu.\n\n\u201cShe wondered what could cause so much anger and hate that a former diplomat could not manage herself in public. Mrs. Obiano stated that she didn\u2019t bother to slap her back, but rather walked away in utter bewilderment\u201d, the statement concluded.\n\nRecall that there was a show of shame and undesirable distraction at the Government House, Awka during the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as governor of Anambra State last Thursday as the wife of the former governor of the state, Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano and wife of the late Ikemba Nnewi, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Mrs. Bianca Ojukwu exchanged fisticuffs at the middle of the swearing ceremony.\n\nSoludo and his deputy, Dr. Onyekachukwu Ibezim had just taken the oath of office and Soludo was still signing the papers before the chief judge of the state, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu when Obiano\u2019s wife arrived and went to where Bianca Ojukwu was seated.\n\nIn what people around initially took as a joke, Mrs. Obiano said to Bianca: \u201cWhat are you doing here? You said we will never win the governorship and here you are.\u201d\n\nInstantly, Bianca slapped her and a fight ensured between them at the high table.\n\nSecurity men and other people at the high table rushed and separated them and dragged Mrs. Obiano to where her husband, Willie Obiano was seating calmly.\n\nAs soon as Soludo finished signing the documents and came down and greeted the Obianos, the former governor and his wife departed from the ceremony. Bianca Ojukwu, however, stayed till the end of the ceremony.\n\nAlthough Governor Soludo expressed worry over the incident, he did not show it.\n\nSoludo\u2019s media aide, Mr. Joe Anatune, thereafter issued a statement and apologized on behalf of his boss about the incident.\n\nHe said: \u201cGovernor Chukwuma Soludo hereby apologises to Anambra people, their friends and guests who attended his inauguration this morning for the breach of protocol.\n\nShortly after ex-Governor Obiano and his wife departed the scene, he was arrested by men of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and taken to Abuja where he is currently being detained.\n\nEFCC trying to strip Obiano of his dignity \u2014James Eze\n\nMeanwhile Mr. James Eze, former chief press secretary to Chief Willie Obiano, has decried what he described as media trial and attempts by the EFCC to strip the immediate past Anambra governor of his dignity.\n\nPooh-poohing a video of Obiano in shorts in EFCC custody that went viral, Mr Eze said no guest of the anti-graft agency had been so treated.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is unfortunate that a video showing the former governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, dressed in unflattering clothes while in EFCC custody was leaked on social media.\n\n\u201cIt hints at a very sinister campaign that smacks of an appalling media trial that will not only strip the accused of his dignity but put him up as a felon even before his trial begins.\n\n\u201cEFCC has had many important guests in the past but none was treated in this embarrassing manner. The question many people are asking is why is former governor Obiano\u2019s case different? Is humiliation of an accused person now a part of the Nigerian law?\u201d",
          "summary": "According to a statement signed by her media aide, Chidiebele Obika, \u201cMrs Obiano has expressed shock over the attitude of Amb.\nMrs. Obiano stated that she didn\u2019t bother to slap her back, but rather walked away in utter bewilderment\u201d, the statement concluded.\nIn what people around initially took as a joke, Mrs. Obiano said to Bianca: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\nSecurity men and other people at the high table rushed and separated them and dragged Mrs. Obiano to where her husband, Willie Obiano was seating calmly.\nAlthough Governor Soludo expressed worry over the incident, he did not show it.",

My membership of the party ceases from today, March 21, 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nYakasai said he served to the best of his ability during his days as Director-General of Media and Communications in Government House and later Special Adviser to the Governor on media, adding he has no regrets but came away with many lessons.\n\nRead Also: Ganduje sacks KACCIMA exco\n\n\u201cDuring the period I improved the image of the state government, and effectively networked with citizens groups to project a positive image of our state on the national scene,\u201d he said.\n\nHe narrated while projecting the image of government in the state and at the centre, he was equally mindful of the campaign promises made to the people as a party, which he stated \u201cthe APC leadership nationwide have fallen short of those promises.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cI travelled to different parts of the country to campaign for the party at the local, state and federal levels. I stuck out my neck, risked my life, gave my word and trust, and extended my belief in a party we thought in 2015 will usher in the leadership that will answer the cry of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cBut as I solemnly committed myself in December 2000 when I made my first entry into partisan politics, I will not just speak truth to power, I will try and live the truth that I speak no matter the cost.\n\n\u201cIt was in that spirit that I vehemently criticised the PDP led government prior to 2015.

          "text": "Six days to the All Progressives Congress (APC) convention, there is no consensus yet on who will be the national chairman.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is believed to be supporting Senator Abdullahi Adamu, but other aspirants have obtained forms and are campaigning.\n\nThe Southwest geo-political zone has shared out the position allocated to it.\n\nThe region has nominated Mr. Isaac Kekemeke (Ondo State) as its candidate for National Vice Chairman (Southwest) and Senator Iyiola Omisore (Osun) as National Secretary.\n\nKekemeke is a former Secretary to the Ondo State government and one-time Attorney-General.\n\nOmisore was a two-time senator.\n\nOndo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who is the coordinator of the Southwest Governors Forum, announced the nominations yesterday.\n\nHe, however, warned against any plot by external forces to truncate the declared interest of the zonal leaders and stakeholders.\n\nHe vowed that the zone would resist efforts to create division by attempting to impose aspirants for party offices.\n\nAkeredolu explained that APC stakeholders in the Southwest micro-zoned the positions that were brought to the region.\n\nSpeaking through his Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, Akeredolu said Kekemeke\u2019s aspiration was not just an Ondo project, but a Southwest project.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe has paid his dues and that is exactly what Mr. Governor has rallied his colleagues to reciprocate.\n\n\u201cThose who are peddling other stories such as national secretary outside Oyo and Osun axis are instruments in the hands of external forces desirous to create division among leaders in the Southwest to impose persons on the party.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, what we are going for is national vice chairman with Kekemeke as our candidate and not the national secretary. Those outside the Southwest, who are attempting to micro-zone our offices for us in Southwest are only creating unnecessary confusion and any such of their permutations outside the decision of stakeholders in the Southwest should be ignored.\u201d\n\nThere was suspense yesterday, following the failure of the screening committee to commence its assignment. The committee is headed by Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari.\n\nThe screening, which was billed to have taken place at the weekend at the Nicon Luxury Hotel in Abuja, was cancelled without any communication from the party.\n\nIt was learnt that some committee members and aspirants that showed up at the screening had to leave when no information was forthcoming.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that the delay in carrying out the screening was informed by the late submission of nomination forms by some aspirants.\n\nA source attributed the none take-off of the screening to moves by some blocs in the party pushing for the harmonisation of the two sub-committees constituted by Chairman Mai Mala Buni, and the one inaugurated by former acting chairman Governor Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nThe Buni committee had Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazak as chairman while the committee inaugurated by Bello is chaired by Masari.\n\nIt was further gathered that the harmonisation is billed to be carried out today to enable the committee to swing to action by tomorrow.\n\nBut, another source said Masari has divided his committee into six subunits, with each of the units handling screening at each geo-political zone.\n\nThe source said: \u201cEach of the six will be sub-divided again into three. With Unit A handling the screening of National Working Committee (NWC) aspirants, Unit B will handle Non-NWC offices.\n\n\u201cUnit C will handle zonal positions so that they can finish their job in one day and present their report to the Appeal Committee.\u201d\n\nAPC governors are still divided over the choice of chairman as of yesterday.\n\nThe governors were also not at ease over the emergence of a list of some preferred candidates by Buhari.\n\nThey have split into caucuses to come up with a Unity List for a second look by Buhari.\n\nThe governors may, however, meet with the President during the week on the matter.\n\nIssues generating tension are as follows:\n\n*Whether or not to adopt consensus or open race for the national chairman\n\n*Opposition to the imposition of candidates.\n\n* Rejection of tinkering with micro-zoning at the last minute.\n\n*Need for the President to respect the inputs of the governors.\n\n*Preparation of a Unity List by governors to present to Buhari\n\nA source said: \u201cGovernors and party leaders have retired into caucuses on how to address some of these last-minute issues. The President prefers adoption of consensus for the offices; governors want outright open contest by aspirants\n\n\u201cFor instance, it was learnt that the President was trying to build consensus around ex-Governor Abdullahi Adamu for the office of the national chairman. But the former governor does not enjoy the backing of most APC governors.\n\n\u201cOthers in the list of favoured candidates are a former President of the Senate, Dr. Ken Nnamani (Deputy National Chairman, South); Farouk Adamu Aliyu (Northwest) for Deputy National Chairman (North); and Ifeolu Oyedele from Ondo State (National Secretary).\n\n\u201cThe governors are claiming that the President\u2019s choices may alter the micro-zoning formula adopted in some geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cThere is disquiet in the North. The Deputy National Chairman (North) ought to come from the Northeast and not Northwest. Even Buhari\u2019s strategist, Farouk Adamu Aliyu from Jigawa State in the Northwest, who is allegedly favoured by the Presidency, is not supported by Governor Abubakar Badaru and other governors in the zone.\n\n\u201cIn the Southwest, the governors in the geopolitical area met and zoned the National Secretary to Oyo/Osun axis and not Ondo State. What the governors ceded to Ondo State were the National Vice Chairman (Southwest) and Zonal Youth Leader.\n\n\u201cThere are many examples of the distortion of the micro-zoning formula in all the six geopolitical zones.\u201d\n\nA governor said: \u201cWe want to work on a Unity List which can assist APC to consolidate and win the hearts of Nigerians in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe do not want imposition of candidates. We want them to emerge from the members of the party.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the President ought to seek the inputs of the governors. We will meet him before the convention with our advisory.\u201d\n\nAll is set\n\nBuni yesterday said that all is now set for the convention on Saturday.\n\nHe said the activities of \u201cthe Protocols Sub-committee had instilled confidence in members that all is set for the biggest party in Africa to now hold its National Convention.\u201d\n\nBuni, who was briefed by the Protocols sub-committee chairman and Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, in Abuja at the weekend, noted that \u201cthe committee has gingered hitherto pessimistic party members that the convention is going to hold\u201d.\n\nGanduje, in a statement by his Commissioner for Information and co-opted member of the committee, Malam Muhammad Garba, quoted Buni as assuring that \u201cthe APC is organising a convention with a global outlook that calls for concerted efforts by all members.\u201d\n\nGanduje told Buni that recruitment of young men and women who will serve as protocol officers and ushers during the convention has been completed.\n\n\u201cThey recruits are receiving training, which is part of the responsibilities of the Protocols committee,\u201d Ganduje added.\n\nOther members of the committee are the Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio; Minister of State for Health, Senator Adeleke Mamora; Rep. Hafiz Kawu from Tarauni Federal Constituency; Abdullahi Shu\u2019aibu, among others.\n\nStepping down yesterday, Sheriff said: \u201cI, Ali Modu Sheriff, will not offer myself for the contest on Saturday because it has been zoned out of my zone. I am from the Northeast.\n\n\u201cNorthcentral is made of Kogi, Kwara, Benue, Nasarawa, Plateau states. These are the places where the chairman will come out from. Borno State is Northeast of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, that\u2019s the position as of today and I want you to communicate to all of our followership, men and women all over the country so that they don\u2019t expect to see my name on the ballot paper.\u201d\n\nAPC senators divided over aspirants\n\nSources said APC Senators are divided over the chairmanship race.\n\nThe lawmakers appear to be in dilemma because of three of their colleagues who are in the race.\n\nThey include Senators Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa), Sani Musa (Niger) and Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa).\n\nIt was gathered that some senators are supporting the candidacy of Adamu, based on information that he is the choice of President Buhari.\n\nIt was also alleged that the senators working for the emergence of Adamu as APC\u2019s National Chairman, are also supporting the choice of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as a Presidential candidate.\n\nA senator said: \u201cThe game plan is to make Abdullahi Adamu the chairman of the party and Farouk Aliyu, a former House of Representatives member from Jigawa State, as the deputy.\n\n\u201cThey are working with some people in the presidency to ensure the emergence of Rotimi Amaechi as the APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cTheir plan is clearly against the wishes of the majority of the party members who believe that a man with his political structures should emerge as the candidate.\n\n\u201cThey have already met with the President and they claimed that the President had bought into their game plan.\u201d\n\nOur reporter observed that some senators were at the Area 11 Garki, Abuja campaign office of Senator Adamu on Friday when the aspirant unveiled the newly renovated edifice.\n\nThe senators who attended the ceremony and spoke on the occasion included, Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege; Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi; Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu; Adamu Aliero and Mohammed Ali Ndume, among others.\n\nSenator Ndume confirmed that he was supporting Adamu because of his competence and blunt attitude.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am supporting Abdullahi Adamu because he is the most qualified and courageous among other aspirants.\n\n\u201cAdamu is somebody who cannot be influenced by money. He is not afraid to say anything in favour of whatever he believes in.\u201d\n\nSenators Al-Makura, Musa and Adamu could not be reached for comments.\n\nHowever, Senator Musa said: \u201cI respect those that are older than me and I also reciprocate the same gesture of respect to those that I am ahead of in terms of age.\n\n\u201cI respect those that are my seniors. I will seize this opportunity to call on those that have been in this system to give those that are new, a trial so that we will come up with fresh ideas.\n\n\u201cAt 57, I should be able to steer the ship of APC and put it on the pedestal of success and of winning elections.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, warned that Nigeria\u2019s situation is getting to a boiling point and could trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 EndSARS if not addressed immediately.\n\nThis is as it berated President Muhammadu Buhari for allegedly failing to take action over the lingering fuel crisis in the country.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the comment by the Presidency that \u2018heavens will not fall\u2019 because of fuel scarcity was akin to daring Nigerians to do their worse.\n\nIt cautioned government that there is a limit to what the citizens can bear under an administration that is \u2018arrogant and insensitive to their plights\u2019.\n\n\u201cIs it not an unpardonable dereliction of duty that while the nation is in turmoil and agonising under a collapsed national grid, protracted fuel crisis, distressed aviation sector, plummeting currency, crippled production and commercial activities, President Buhari remains aloof and \u2018absent\u2019 as always?\n\n\u201cThe failure by President Buhari, who also doubles as the minister of Petroleum Resources to take immediate action, other than the snobbish stance by his Presidency that \u2018heavens will not fall\u2019 because of fuel scarcity amounts to daring Nigerians to do their worse.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cIt is often said when a government abdicates its responsibility to the citizens at whose pleasure it should serve, then that government is complicit in the suffering of its people and a beneficiary of their woes.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cSadly today, thousands of small and medium scale enterprises; the drivers of the economy are folding up daily, industries are relocating to neighbouring countries, universities are on strike, the aviation sector is on the brink of collapse, our railway is tottering to a halt due to lack of diesel, police are threatening to go on strike, insecurity is on the rise due to the collapse of the informal economic sector, yet Mr. President had time to holiday in England.\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari could personally communicate on issues that concern his fizzling party, the APC, while in England, it is inconceivable that he failed and neglected, as always, to attend to life discounting experiences and pains encountered by Nigerians daily by the thoughtless and inhumane policies of his government.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari needs to be reminded of his duty to Nigerians, to in the least, show some empathy, competence and concern as our country rapidly drifts towards a looming precipice.

          "text": "By Sylvanus Viashima, Jalingo\n\nTaraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku in this exclusive interview has alleged the Federal Government is either confused or not telling Nigerians the truth about the prolonged fuel scarcity and other causes of hardship in the country. He also spoke on insecurity and fears for the 2023 general elections and the crisis in the PDP and other issues.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nHow do you feel about this prolonged fuel scarcity and what in your opinion is the way out?\n\nIt is a pity that we have found ourselves in this kind of situation. Yes, fuel scarcity is not something entirely new to us but then it has never been this bad. To the extent that diesel is selling for as much as eight hundred Naira per litter. Aviation fuel is also extremely expensive such that there have been flight cancellation all over the place. It is simply unheard of. The case of PMS which affects the common man even more is perhaps the most pathetic. People have to spend days on the queue to get fuel and it is terrible. The sad reality is that, it affects virtually every aspect of our lives.\n\nTransportation is almost paralyzed and where people are able to travel especially to convey goods for sale, they are made to pay heavily for it and naturally, they factor the cost into the overall cost of the goods and that means a sharp and unpleasant rise in the cost of goods and to that extent, even services. The entire economy is in distress because of this situation. As a purely agrarian state, I can tell you I am in a position to understand this better than anyone else. By the time the farmer moves his yam from Tsukundi to Wukari, the cost of transportation compares him to sell the yam almost twice the normal price he would have ordinarily. Same thing is the challenge with those moving rice from Karim Lamido to Jalingo or from Baisa and Abong to the town for sale. They are made to pay twice or even triple the normal price and this is factored into the final sales price for the products. So the people are suffering untold hardship.\n\nI have listened to the authorities and those who are supposed to manage the situation and I think they are virtually confused. They said that they have pumped millions of gallons of petroleum products into the market and yet we cannot see the impact. It is like they are not even telling the people the truth. They should come out and be more sincere with Nigerians because the situation is really very bad. You must also bear in mind that this is happening at a time that the prices of crude oil have reached an all time high for over a decade now. There should be a windfall and not this. We have heard this administration tell us time and again that the previous administration enjoyed a windfall and if it were replicated, things would be better. Now, we have the windfall and things are actually worse. I think this is as a result of our inability to manage the oil sector of our economy.\n\nUnfortunately, it is the most critical sector. Sadly, we keep hearing stories of millions of barrels of crude oil missing and all of that. It is very sad and unfortunate. If our refineries were working well, we would not be having this conversation. The thing is that the managers of the system are not telling us the truth about this fuel subsidy. Why is it impossible to end the subsidy? This administration came on board denying the reality of oil subsidy. They said there was nothing like fuel subsidy. That it was a scam. From there they moved on to say that okay there is a subsidy but we would remove it by jacking up the price of fuel. They did that promising us that it would be the end of fuel subsidy and fuel scarcity and yet we have not seen any of that. Rather, we still have huge budgetary allocation for fuel subsidy and we are suffering unspeakable pains from fuel scarcity.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nAs a governor, you go out to take a drive in the night and find husbands and fathers on queue at filling stations rather than in the warmth of their loved ones and you really feel their pains. So, I think there is a lot of insincerity and short practices going on in the sector and some persons are profiting hugely from it and the people who are profiting from the scarcity and of course the subsidy regime are doing everything to ensure that the status quo remains. For instance, if our refineries were working, it would have been a lot more difficult to manipulate the prices. And so they make sure that the refineries don\u2019t work.\n\nWhat is your take on the ongoing strike by ASUU?\n\nThe ASUU strike has become a regular problem in our education system and it is very sad because our universities have become places students just go to waste time. You get into school and you cannot tell when you will graduate because of strikes occasioned by the attitude of our educational administration.\n\nThe federal Ministry of Education in particular, I don\u2019t think they have the right attitude towards the management of the crisis. In fact, ASUU strikes are very avoidable. Most of the demands that they are making are not so monumental that they cannot be met by the Federal Government. It is just that we don\u2019t have the right attitude to education. Otherwise, the ASUU is not asking for too much. In any case, they are asking for the government to fulfill its own promises and for better funding of the education system in the country. These are not too much.\n\nHowever, the ASUU also believe that the only way issues can be resolved is through strike and that is also very wrong. They need to explore more of dialogue and compromise rather than confrontation. That is my problem with them otherwise, I don\u2019t think they are asking for too much. I think we need to fund education better and address some of these issues so that students and parents don\u2019t get to suffer this much all the time.\n\nGiven our present circumstances, it is clearly difficult to say that any sector can be sufficiently funded. The available resources are simply never enough. The best you can do is to prioritize. What we did in our case as a state is to make sure that we give the sector the needed attention. That is why today, our state University is among the top 20 in the country. We have more faculties and professors and are really doing our best.\n\nThe Muslim Council has continued to raise the alarm that the state government is marginalising Muslims in the state in terms of appointment. What is the true position of things?\n\nThe government has been very fair to all sectors of our state. Appointments are made based on set rules and standards. These have always guided promotion and appointment. Appointments are made based on qualifications and stipulations that are already there. Look at the University for example, they have their own process of doing their appointments and promotions. So, except if the Muslim Council is saying we should set aside the established rules and sacrifice merit on the altar of mediocrity, I don\u2019t think they have any genuine complain.\n\nIn most cases, I don\u2019t even participate directly in appointments and promotions of people. There are rules guiding these and there are persons who are paid to do just that. What I have insisted is that the merit should not be sacrificed for mediocrity. I don\u2019t even know these people. So they should complain if the rules are not followed rather than bring up this issue of religion. This is not a religious affair.\n\nCan you give us an update on the security situation in the state especially as regards activities of bandits?\n\nThe security situation in the state is a bit better now. At least there has been serious improvement now even though we still have occasional acts of activities of these elements but things are much better. What we have done is to consciously explore all available options including assisting security agencies operating in the state with operational vehicles and other logistics to aid their work.\n\nWe have also encouraged community participation and collaboration with various security agencies so it is relatively easier for them to get the right intelligence to nip some of these things in the bud. Of course, we are not even close to where we want to be. We know the threat that usually comes with the farming season and we are warming up to tackle that. What we actually want is to have a state that is a safe haven for those who want to earn honest living.\n\nThe state is full of potentials and the only thing that is stopping massive investment is just insecurity. And so there is so much to be desired but we are not leaving any stone unturned. Recently, we discovered that some of the traditional rulers are not on alert enough. What I mean is that, as a traditional ruler, you should be able to keep track of who comes into your Chiefdom and when you notice the influx of strange persons, you have a duty to investigate discreetly and report your findings to the security agencies who obviously cannot be everywhere. And so we have had to complain bitterly and warn some of these traditional rulers who are lacking in this responsibility. In fact, I have warned that anyone found wanting henceforth risk being replaced. So, we are also calling on all the people in the state irrespective of background to stay alert and vigilant so that we can jointly tackle the issue of insecurity in the state to get the Taraba of our dream.\n\nAt the National level, what is your take on the security situation ahead of the activities leading up to next year\u2019s elections?\n\nWell, like I have always said, the security situation is simply alarming. It is totally unacceptable and very worrisome, especially in the North where we have banditry, insurgency, and other major security challenges. Occasionally, we have issues in the South but I think the major threat is here in the North.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSadly, this administration has failed badly in tackling this menace. As a matter of fact, the situation has never been this bad. As you know, elections time is very sensitive because it entails mass movement of people going back to their various places to participate in election there. So, if the roads are not safe, then there would be major problem.\n\nYou notice recently that even the rail system is becoming unsafe with reported cases of attacks on trains so it is really worrisome. Nigerians are really worried that the roads are unsafe, the rails are unsafe, the flights are becoming too expensive even for those who used to patronize them. And so people can no longer travel with the assurance of safety. And so the APC Federal Government must rise up and do much more to address this issue rather than just giving mere assurances . These senseless killings must stop or be reduced to the barest minimum possible.\n\nHow do you feel about the electoral Act as amended?\n\nWell, you know that Nigerians unitedly were really excited about the amendment of the electoral Act and we all saw their reactions when the president was needlessly delaying his accent to the bill. He was eventually forced literally to sign the bill only for him to come back with more amendments which the National Assembly out-rightly rejected. That shows the anxiety and crave the Nigerian people have for free, fair and credible elections. So, it is actually a good thing that the Act as amended is now a legal document and has become a part of our system.\n\nThe problem in the past has always been about people having access to election results unduly and manipulating them to suit their agenda with impunity. I think the Electoral Act as amended has addressed much of that challenge. However, as beautiful as it is, we must realise that the law does not implement itself. And so I urge all Nigerians to be faithful to that law. Those entrusted with running the election must do so dispassionately.\n\nAfter about seven years in office as the governor, what are some of your most cherished achievements?\n\nWell, when we came to power in 2015, we noticed a lot of challenges and we were determined to make a difference. And so for me, what may be the major achievements of this administration may not be for me. In fact, for me, what I cherish most are the projects that benefit the people directly and have the most impact on the lives of the people. For instance, when we came in, we discovered that there was no water in Jalingo, which is the state capital. That was very embarrassing for me. And so we embarked on massive water projects. Within just the first few weeks, the intervention was monumental. And then we proceeded to provide 2000 boreholes in two thousand communities across the state. And so there is water everywhere around the state now. Presently, there is a gigantic water project going on in Jalingo that, when completed, will solve the water problem of Jalingo for the next 30 years irrespective of population growth and expansion.\n\nIn order to tackle the level of poverty in the state, we also embarked on massive skill acquisition and empowerment programmes, training people in various skills and empowering them to start up their businesses. Jointly with the efforts of the pet Project of the First Lady, we have trained and empowered hundreds of thousands of women and youth from Taraba.\n\nOur intervention in the agricultural sector has created several millionaire farmers within a very short time. It gives me great joy each time I meet beneficiaries of all these and see the joy that permeate their faces. Look at the health sector for instance, we had to pick three general Hospitals across the three senatorial zones and transform them into world class medical facilities. Before then, these hospitals were death traps literally because there were no equipment and facilities and so people from all over the place had to come to Jalingo. We have also funded primary health care facilities across the state such that quality health delivery is literally at the doorstep of the people. I feel fulfilled that our pregnant women don\u2019t have to walk long distances or suffer on motorcycles to access basic medical care and attention.\n\nOur students are now competing favourably with their counterparts across the country. In fact, we are the best in the Northeast going by WAEC results and among the best in the country. Our students go for spelling bees and other national competitions and they come home with great results. This boosts their self confidence and it gives us joy.\n\nWhat most people see and talk about are things like roads and such tangible projects. Even in that regard, we have done remarkably well. I was in Baissa and Abong in Kurmi recently and received overwhelming welcome for constructing the Mararaba/Baissa/Abong road that has been ignored for decades. Maybe, I should shock you that Kurmi is one of the richest non oil producing local government areas in this country. And there was no road there. That is the road that also lead directly to the Mambila Hydropower Dam. And so despite lean resources, we decided to do that project knowing how much it will impact the lives of the people and I must say I am impressed with the result so far. Right now in Jalingo, the dualisation of the Sibre Pantisawa road and the construction of the first Flyover in the Northeast end is almost completed. This project will give Jalingo a new outlook completely and also ease movement. We have also done major road projects across the state that has made it easy for farmers to move their produce to the market and this has greatly improved the lives of the people. That is what gives me joy.\n\nSo when people ask me about my achievements, and laugh because they are inexhaustible but I am always very happy when I see the people happy because of the little we have been able to do for them. There is so much we have achieved including giving employment to thousands including almost four thousand teachers.\n\nWho is your idea successor?\n\nIt is not in my power to decide my successor. Power comes from God and so what I have always told the people is that I have not ordained any successor. At the appropriate time, I am sure the voice of God will be heard on who should take over the reins of power in the state. That is why I urge the people to pray fervently and seek the face of God in making this very important decision.\n\nHow do you feel as a critical stakeholder in the PDP, about the fight between some major players in your party?\n\nNaturally, election times unveil different disagreements of conflict of interest that have been subdued for so long and so it is not unusual. In fact, it is not unusual for people to disagree. What we do not support is people taking such matters to the level that it begins to affect the entire party and by implications, the nation.\n\nTo that extent, we have been very vocal in advising stakeholders to watch their public utterances. In as much as there is bound to be disagreements, it is not every fight that must be advertised in the market place. Whatever the issues are, they can be resolved in-house amicably. The party has already reacted by setting up a committee to address the issues and I can assure you that these are not issues that can affect the chances of the party.\n\nOf course, it is very clear that the PDP has proven to be the most peaceful and organized party in the country. Look at our national convention. Just look at all the activities of the party. You can\u2019t compare it with the crisis tearing other political parties in the country. We believe that we are going to fulfill public expectation of providing a reliable and dependable alternative to the gross failure we have faced in the last couple of years.\n\nThe APC has already messed up the country and everything is working upside down because the APC has been very negligent. Our hope is for Nigerians to continue to trust the PDP and to join hands with us and once again give us the chance to turn things around.\n\nWhat are your plans for 2023?\n\nWell, for now, I am still consulting. My people have been calling that I should go and represent them at the National Assembly as a Senator. I am still considering it but my major preoccupation now is to deliver on my Rescue Agenda. When the time comes, if God says I should proceed to the Senate as they are clamouring, fine. Whatever God decides is perfect for me.",

          "title": "Court Dismisses Another Suit Seeking Sack of Buni-led CECPC",
          "text": "\n\n*Holds serving governors, other members of committee not on paid employment\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Y. Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court has dismissed a suit challenging the legality of the Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHalilu, in a judgement delivered March 1, with its Certified True Copy Dated March 18, which was sighted by THISDAY, held that the claimant woefully failed to prove allegations made against the defendants.\n\n\n\nThe claimant, former Chairman of the Kwara State APC, Bashir Bolarinwa, had last year dragged the party and members of CECPC to court challenging the legality of the committee set up June 25, 2020 as well as his removal as Kwara State APC Chairman. Bolarinwa also challenged the powers of APC\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) to dissolve the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee in 2020, among other issues.\n\n\n\nAPC, CECPC Chairman Mai Mala Buni, John Akpanudoedehe, Abubakar Bello, Isiaka Bello, Stella Okotete, Professor Tahir Mamman, Ken Nnamani, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon Akinremi Olaide, Dr. James Lalu, Chief David Lyon, Senator Abba Ali, Ismael Ahmed, and Abdulahi Samario, were the first to 15th defendants, respectively, in the suit.\n\nAmong the issues Bolarinwa took to court for determination were: whether the appointment of the 2, 4, and 5 defendants, being serving governors of Yobe, Niger and Osun states respectively, as Chairman and members of CECPC of the APC, was legal and constitutional, having regard to the provisions of Section 183and 223 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nHe said if the question was answered in the negative, whether their appointment was not a gross violation of the constitution.\n\nClaimant further urged the court to determine whether the decision of the APC NEC made on December 8, 2020 to extend the tenure of the CECPC for a period of six months was valid, having regard to Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nAmong the declarations Bolarinwa sought from the court was that Buni and the other serving governors\u2019 presence in CECPC was illegal and unconstitutional with regard to Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution. He further called for another declaration that having violated the provisions of Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution, the governors were no longer entitled to Section 308, which guaranteed their immunity from prosecution.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the claimant urged the court to declare that all decisions and actions taken by CECPC from June 25, 2020 till they were removed from office were illegal, null and void, having regard to Section 183, 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nThe court was then urged for an order removing the second to 14th defendants from office as chairman and members of CECPC, as well as another nullifying and setting aside all actions and purported removal of claimant by the second to 14th defendants on January 4, 2021\n\nBolarinwa had sought, \u201cAn order nullifying and setting aside the purported ward congresses conducted by the CECPC in Kwara State on July 31, 2021\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the first to 14th defendants from conducting any other congresses into any office in the APC pursuant to the Notice of Congress issued by the second to 14th defendants or from performing any other functions in their capacities as CEPCC.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after an examination of the case of the claimant, the court came to the conclusion that the, \u201cContention of the claimant is borne out of the misinterpretation and misconception of the provisions of Sections 183, 223 of the constitution as well as provisions referred to in this case which clearly shows the claimant\u2019s failure to appreciate the essence and purpose of the resolution of the APC\u2019s NEC on June 25, 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court also noted that the fulcrum of the claimant\u2019s complaint against the dissolution of the NWC were that the appointment of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th defendants contravened Section 183 and Article 17 of APC and that the appointment of CECPC by NEC to take the place of NWC was not democratic in line with Section 223 of the constitution.\n\nThe court explained that all the allegations were denied by the defendants, thereby putting the claimant to the strictest proof of the same.\n\nAccording to the judge, the claimant could not prove that the governors and other members of CECPC, who are sitting and serving members took up the appointment in full capacity or are in paid employment in that executive official capacity to constitute an infraction or contravention of the provision of Section 183 of the constitution.\n\nHalilu stated that the counter affidavits of the defendants also showed that they were constituted to temporarily perform the function of conducting the national convention of APC and nothing more.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the dissolution of the Oshiomhole NWC, the court held that NEC did not violate the constitution of the party as Article 13 (3) of the APC constitution empowered it to intervene when there was crisis in the running of the party and that by setting up CECPC, which was mandated to conducted a national convention to elect new NWC, , NEC was in order.\n\n\n\nThe judge further explained that Section 223 of the constitution was not a guarantee of tenure of office of four years but rather for the conduct of election into the party elective offices by political parties.\n\nOn the removal of the claimant by CECPC in January last year, the court held that he who had power to appoint also had the power to fire, adding that NEC donated its powers to CECPC when it inaugurated the committee to replace the NWC in the interim.\n\n\n\nThe judge accordingly dismissed the suit for lacking in merit.\n\nHalilu held, \u201cClaimant has woefully failed to justify the grant of reliefs sought in his originating summons. The entire suit having regards to the facts and circumstances of the same, constitute an abuse of judicial process and liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI shall dismiss the said suit by consigning the same to a forlorn of judicial debris.\n\n\u201cAccordingly suit number CV/2006/2021 is hereby dismissed for the reason advanced.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ahead of National Convention, APC Begins Screening of Aspirants Today",
          "text": "\n\n* Adamu, Akume, five other chairmanship aspirants to be screened Monday\n\n* We will provide adequate security, logistics for convention, says Lalong\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will today begin the screening of some aspirants for various positions in the National Working Committee (NWC), ahead of the March 26 National Convention. APC 2022 National Convention Screening Committee headed by the Kastina State Governor, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari had earlier scheduled to conduct the screening exercise in two batches yesterday and today.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY however gathered that the exercise did not start yesterday as scheduled apparently due to the late submission of forms by the aspirants. Though the party gave no reason for not commencing the exercise as scheduled, it was learnt that the aspirants were still returning their forms as of 7 p.m. last night.\n\nWith the delay in the commencement of the screening, the seven chairmanship aspirants are expected to be screened on Monday.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Chairman of Venue, Decoration, and Site Servicing Committee for the National Convention and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong has promised adequate security and logistics for the event.\n\nChairmanship aspirants who beat the deadline for the submission of nomination forms were two former governors of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Abdulaziz Yari; and the youngest aspirant, Mr. Etsu Mohammed.\n\n\n\nYari, who is from the North-west, is the only aspirant that is not from the North-central, which is expected to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship, according to the zoning arrangement.\n\nYari\n\nYari was a two-term Governor of Zamfara State and a one-time Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors. He has the resources and political experience.\n\n\n\nIf antecedents are anything to go by, then it would be difficult for Yari to realise his ambition. The way Yari managed the 2018 primaries before the 2019 elections caused all the APC candidates in the state to lose the elections to the PDP. Also, his inability to curtail bandits during his tenure as the governor of Zamfara State was a disaster. Today, bandits have almost crippled not only the state but the nation. The defection of the current Governor Bello Matawalle to the ruling APC is seen by political watchers as a threat to his aspirations. Matawalle is reportedly not on the same page with Yari. The zoning arrangement of APC is also not in his favour.\n\nSaliu Mustapha\n\nHe is the Turaki of Ilorin. Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the founder of Saliu Mustapha Foundation (SMF) which is involved in huge philanthropic services.\n\nA die-hard Buharist, Mustapha paid his dues in political party administration. He was once a national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC, one of the legacy parties that formed the APC. His membership of the defunct CPC gave him an edge as both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nHis weakness is that he lacks leadership experience as he has never held any other political appointment apart from the deputy chairman of the defunct CPC.\n\nGeorge Akume\n\nAkume was a two-term governor of Benue State, former senator, and a serving Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs. With these positions, he has acquired enough leadership experience to manage the diverse interests of the ruling party.\n\nAs a cabinet member, he can also galvanise the support of some of his colleagues to realise his ambition. He also has the intellectual and mental capacity required to battle for the national chairmanship seat. His major weak point was the loss of APC in the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nAl-Makura is also a former Nasarawa State Governor. The 69-year-old businessman-turned-politician is also keen on becoming the next APC chairman. As a former governor and serving Senator, Al-Makura has the required resources, experience, and network to become the next national chairman. Al-Makura has running battles with the EFCC. Last year, he visited the EFCC headquarters a couple of times to answer questions on money laundering running into billions of naira. The former governor, however, said he was only invited by the EFCC but was never detained.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu\n\nAdamu was the pioneer Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and the current senator representing Nasarawa West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nAdamu was governor of Nasarawa State from May 29, 1999, to May 29, 2007. He is believed to have been anointed as the consensus national chairman but the other contestants have refused to accept his nomination.\n\nAs a third-term senator and former governor, he has the enormous experience to pilot the affairs of the ruling party.\n\nAt 75, some party leaders believe Adamu is too old to be in the race, taking into cognisance the complex nature of the job.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa\n\nThe 54-year-old member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly represents Niger East senatorial district. He has a good relationship with party members. Two governors were said to have recommended him to President Muhammadu Buhari as a consensus candidate. However, he does not have the necessary experience as a party administrator.\n\nEtsu Mohammed\n\nAt just 37, Mohammed is the youngest of all the aspirants. He is an aide to Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State and a former youth leader of the defunct ANPP. Not much is known about him politically.\n\nIyiola Omisore\n\nFor the position of the National Secretary of the party, zoned to the South-west, a former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore has also submitted his nomination form. Omisore was a senator from 2003 to 2011. A former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, and an Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele are also in the race but it was not clear if they had submitted their forms as of last night.\n\nAdebayo Shittu\n\nA former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu is the first person to indicate interest in the office of APC National Secretary. However, Shittu\u2019s aspiration did not garner the support of the APC governors in the South-west. That did not deter him from pursuing his aspiration, leveraging on his goodwill with Buhari\u2019s political allies.\n\nShittu, a member of the 2005 National Political Reform Conference, has been an ally of Buhari.\n\nIfe Oyedele\n\nExecutive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele, is another aspirant for the office of APC National Secretary. Before he was appointed NDPHC\u2019s executive director in charge of Engineering &Technical Services, little was known about Oyedele. Like Shittu, he has been close to the political family of the president since the time of the defunct CPC.\n\n\n\nHe was among the key persons that promoted Buhari\u2019s presidential aspiration in 2011. At its formation, Oyedele served on the CPC Constitution Drafting Committee and also represented the party during the alliance talk in 2011 and merger talks that produced the APC in 2013.

          "text": "\n\n*Northern group rallies support for CBN gov\u2019s presidency\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi, Uzoma Mba in Lagos and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nA civil society organisation, Save Nigeria Project (SNP), has alleged that desperate politicians have approached it and other credible groups to launch a million-dollar smear campaign against President Muhammadu Buhari; his economic agenda, as well as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele and his monetary policies.\n\nThis is coming as the Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF) yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nSNP disclosed the alleged smear campaign plot yesterday at a World Press Conference on 2023 and the State of the Nation, held in Lagos, which had in attendance, representatives from Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, All Progressives Congress (APC) Young Professionals Movement, and Niger Delta Youth Vanguard.\n\n\n\nOthers include the Yoruba Council of Youths, Igbo Youth Movement, Middle Belt Youth Movement, South East Youth Assembly and Lawyers in Defence of Democracy.\n\nSNP Convener, Mr Peter Abang, said they alerted the public to disregard the smear campaigns once they kicked off.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Save Nigeria Project will also take advantage of this briefing to alert the world on the activities of desperate politicians ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have been approached and we believe, many other credible groups have also been approached by some desperate politicians of questionable character with a pool of funds of up to one million Dollars to be allegedly shared by consenting groups for a massive smear campaign against the person of President Buhari, his economic agenda, the person and office of Mr Godwin Emefiele and his policies in the CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have outrightly rejected the offer. Nigerians should note that once this condemnable project starts, they should disregard it and treat them with the disdain they deserve,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said part of the plan by those behind the plot was to clone and impersonate credible groups to churn out lies and misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\n\nPassing a vote of confidence on President Buhari, SNP said the country has been on a steady march towards development since 2015, adding that more infrastructural growth has been recorded than at any other time.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented revolution in the agricultural sector cannot be overemphasised in discussing the state of the nation today.\n\n\n\n\u201cUntil President Buhari came to power, no Nigerian had ever seen massive pyramids built with only rice paddy.\n\n\u201cNigeria was never rated as a global producer of rice before 2015 but now it is a super force in global rice production and no longer a dumping ground for spoilt unhealthy rice from Asia and other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, we note that the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that inflation is going down. This shows a positive trajectory and recovery for the economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough the various Social Intervention Programmes now domiciled in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the federal government has lifted millions out of penury and joblessness into economic productivity and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe economy has also expanded and fortified against global shocks in record time, beating the projection of financial experts, the country has exited recession. Available data also show economic growth which is more than the projections.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is given this favourable assessment of our country\u2019s leadership and the state of the nation this first quarter of 2022 that we as a civil society organisation pass a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari, his economic agenda and the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria ably led by Mr Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele\u201d.\n\nThe group commended APC for \u201czoning power to the South in the interest of peace and inclusiveness,\u201d urging other political parties to do the same.\n\n\n\nIt said the country should have a president that would continue to consolidate and expand the vision, as well as the landmark legacy of Buhari, adding that a thorough professional of Igbo extraction should succeed the president next year.\n\n\n\nSNP also called on Buhari to support a candidate who embodies a winnable personality and ticks all the numerous boxes, adding that it should be someone he would be proud of.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is after a very rigorous search that we have come to the unequivocal and emphatic conclusion that only one man fits this description and we make bold to present to Mr President for his endorsement and to Nigerians for their massive support, Mr Godwin, Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for President, 2023. Emefiele has shown unprecedented sagacity as Governor of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis initiatives for small, medium and large scale enterprises have been unprecedented. In manufacturing, oil and gas, agriculture, trade and commerce, the signature of the CBN Governor has been very clear and precise.\n\n\u201cThe numerous interventions of the bank under high standard supervision is second to none. Rice farmers in our country have never had it so good in our entire history,\u201d the group added.\n\nNorthern Group Rallies Support for Emefiele\u2019s Presidency\n\nIn a related development, a northern group, UNNYF yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nAddressing stakeholders in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, the spokesperson of the youth group, Mr Aliyu Muhammad Sani, said the forum has been going around some states in the North for consultations with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\nSani explained that the youth group embarked on the consultation to produce a credible, competent, and economically-endowed leader that would consolidate on rapid economic growth that the CBN governor had already started in his current position.\n\n\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but I dare boldly to say that, Mr Godwin Emefiele\u2019s achievements have reflected in all states of the country and are there for history and posterity to judge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt never came easy; it was not done at his comfort zone, rather, it took a lot of courage, foresight, perseverance, determination, and hard work to overcome the numerous challenges scavenging on the fragile economy of our dear nation,\u201d Sani said.\n\n\n\nHe concluded that Emefiele had contained and dealt with a 60 per cent decline in the price of crude oil.\n\nIn a remark, the Nasarawa State Coordinator for UNNYF for Emefiele 2023, Mr Faruk Mohammed Ofoku, said the Lafia consultation became necessary considering the youthful inclusion of Nasarawa youth in the decision-making process in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe good people of Nasarawa State benefited so much from the good stewardship of the current CBN Governor. Nasarawa is the home of solid minerals; Mr Emefiele\u2019s policies of diversification invested so much in solid mineral resources and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking at all these economic and life-saving interventions of the CBN Governor in Nasarawa State and all other northern states, we the progressive Northern Nigerian Youth of Nasarawa State joined the National leadership of our Coalition and strongly call on Mr Godwin Emefiele to please, as matter of urgency, declare to run for the President of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Ofoku explained.\n\nOfoku said their call was timely because the Nasarawa youths wanted their economy, especially mining and agriculture, to be rejuvenated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, worked behind the scenes to obtain a court order from Umuahia, Abia State, which ordered the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the Amended Electoral Act, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Malami worked with the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who are all nursing political ambitions ahead of the 2023 general elections, to obtain a court order that would keep them in office even if they join politics.\n\nIt is like having their cake and eating it too.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State, ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave the office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nWhile signing the Electoral Bill into law last month, President Buhari had asked the National Assembly to delete section 84 (12), which restricts sitting cabinet members from contesting for elective offices without resigning.\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\nMalami is interested in becoming Kebbi governor; Nwajiuba is being projected by the Project Nigeria Group (PNG) for the presidency; Ngige says he is consulting on running for president; Akpabio has received the backing of the Godswill Akpabio Uncommon Transformational Support Organisation (GAUTSO) to also return to the poll; while the Southern Mandate Group and Chibuike Amaechi Crusaders 2023 want the transportation minister to succeed Buhari.\n\nHowever, top sources revealed to SaharaReporters on Friday night that Malami was the brains behind the court order obtained from Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General is behind the court ruling in Abia State. He received funds from Amaechi and CBN governor to fund the litigation and find the judge to do so as Abuja Federal Court judges refused to touch the case,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF (Malami) was being asked to resign as of last week. He, Amaechi and CBN governor were scared,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, in the AGF office said the AGF would give effect to the purported judgment without delay.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malami had said following the Senate\u2019s refusal, the Nigerian government would consider all other options available to it before a position would be taken.\n\nIt is clear one of the options Malami and others found was a judge to do their bidding.",

          "text": "The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, worked behind the scenes to obtain a court order from Umuahia, Abia State, which ordered the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the Amended Electoral Act, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Malami worked with the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who are all nursing political ambitions ahead of the 2023 general elections, to obtain a court order that would keep them in office even if they join politics.\n\nIt is like having their cake and eating it too.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State, ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave the office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nWhile signing the Electoral Bill into law last month, President Buhari had asked the National Assembly to delete section 84 (12), which restricts sitting cabinet members from contesting for elective offices without resigning.\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\nMalami is interested in becoming Kebbi governor; Nwajiuba is being projected by the Project Nigeria Group (PNG) for the presidency; Ngige says he is consulting on running for president; Akpabio has received the backing of the Godswill Akpabio Uncommon Transformational Support Organisation (GAUTSO) to also return to the poll; while the Southern Mandate Group and Chibuike Amaechi Crusaders 2023 want the transportation minister to succeed Buhari.\n\nHowever, top sources revealed to SaharaReporters on Friday night that Malami was the brains behind the court order obtained from Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General is behind the court ruling in Abia State. He received funds from Amaechi and CBN governor to fund the litigation and find the judge to do so as Abuja Federal Court judges refused to touch the case,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF (Malami) was being asked to resign as of last week. He, Amaechi and CBN governor were scared,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, in the AGF office said the AGF would give effect to the purported judgment without delay.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malami had said following the Senate\u2019s refusal, the Nigerian government would consider all other options available to it before a position would be taken.\n\nIt is clear one of the options Malami and others found was a judge to do their bidding.",

Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me.\n\n\u201cInstead, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do, using unprintable, vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office but I ignored her completely. Then she kept on aggressively putting her hand on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught as advised by people sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrains from touching me with her hands.\n\n\u201cShe proceeded to do so yet again and tried to touch my head and remove my headtie. It was at this point I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me.\n\n\u201cAs she made towards me, I den pulled away her wig, she then held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA (All Progressives Grand Alliance) chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told everyone to leave. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day.\n\n\u201cHow could the first lady be so drunk at that time? I stayed back to watch the ceremony till the end and left with my dignity intact.\u201d",

          "text": "Austin Avuru, former chief executive officer of Seplat Energy Plc, says 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production is lost to oil theft.\n\nThis is coming amid an assertion by Tony Elumelu, chairman of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc that Nigeria is \u201closing over 95 percent of oil production to thieves\u201d.\n\nAvuru, in a report, titled \u201cReining in the Collapse of the Nigerian Oil Industry\u201d published by the Africa Oil+Gas Report, called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe urged regulators and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to set up a \u201cwar room\u201d strategy to develop a plan to return the oil sector to \u201cfull bloom\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith eyes fixed on divestments and exit, the IOCs have not made any meaningful investments in the last fifteen years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe result has not just been declining production. Much worse, the entire export pipeline network has been surrendered to vandals and illegal bunkerers. Thus, the phrase \u201cCrude theft\u201d which crept into the industry about 2010 has taken on a new meaning.\n\n\u201cThere are some pipeline systems now (particularly in the East), where 80% (eighty percent) of production injected therein does not make it to the terminal!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, almost every producer is now cooking up \u201calternative evacuation\u201d schemes that cost four to five times what pipeline export would normally cost!\n\n\u201cThe stark reality today is that the IOCs are leaving. Their decision to leave is outside our control as a nation. In fact, over the last twelve years, Shell and Chevron have divested from a total of twenty-one blocks. It is now public knowledge that Shell and ExxonMobil are now exiting the onshore/shallow water altogether,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, my projection is that, by Christmas day of 2025, TOTAL would be the only IOC in J.V with NNPC.\n\n\u201cThe situation is the same with domestic gas delivery. Even though we are weaving all the right slogans about the future of gas in Nigeria, in the past five years, I can only point at a couple of Nigerian independents who are investing in gas development and processing for the domestic market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe state of the NNPC Towers in Abuja, headquarters of the Nigerian oil industry: Just standing back and intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution to the question of retreating IOCs Nigerian Petroleum Industry is a National Emergency. Oil production is down to about 1.4Million barrels per day and declining and this includes about 600,000BOPD from the deepwater.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas production has stagnated at about 1.2Billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day over the past five years at a time when projected production should have been 3.5Bcf per day. The collateral impact of course, is the low level of power generation which itself has stagnated at about 4,000Mega watts per day since 2015.\u201d\n\nAvuru added that the full impact of the current oil production level can only be imagined when oil prices return to the $60 per barrel level.\n\n\u201cI dare repeat that the situation has to be treated as a national emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetween the upstream regulator (the commission) and NNPC, they need to set up a \u201cwar room\u201d, some form of an effective task force to develop a blueprint for returning the industry to full bloom. The responses we hear today to the myriad of problems outlined above have been ad-hoc, knee jerk and in some cases only self-serving.\u201d\n\nAvuru outlined some issues that must be addressed in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen IOCs leave a matured petroleum patch, independents, whether local or international, usually move in to inject fresh capital, run a nimble efficient operation and maximize production and reserves addition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cA well-organised transition driven by a clear policy direction, from the retreating IOCs to a crop of efficient independents with the requisite resources will have to be implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJust standing back and intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution proffered by NNPC.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains. Eighty percent of our remaining reserves are still in this belt.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we have to address the twin problems of reliable pipeline evacuation and community restiveness. These problems have become heightened, not because there is no solution, but because we have abandoned every attention to them in the last fifteen years.\n\n\u201cWhen these two problems are tackled, plus a strict application of the \u201cdrill or drop\u201d provisions of the new PIA, huge investments in drilling and facilities revamp will flow again into this terrain.\n\n\u201cFinally, we have to match our gas slogans with effective, measurable, policy actions to drive investments in domestic gas supply. The current flip-flops on pricing and commercial structure of the gas business cannot stimulate investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cThis industry will not wake up by God\u2019s miracle. We have to wake up and design the stimulant that will revitalise it.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) had said the country loses more than 115,000 barrels per day to oil theft and vandalism.\n\nTheCable had reported that oil producers in Nigeria lamented oil thieves are raking in \u2018petrodollars\u2019 while Nigeria is bedeviled by low production.\n\nIn February, Nigeria\u2019s oil production had dropped to an average of 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.39 million the previous month.",

          "title": "Austin Avuru: 80% of Nigeria\u2019s oil production lost to theft",
          "text": "Austin Avuru, former chief executive officer of Seplat Energy Plc, says 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production is lost to oil theft.\n\nThis is coming amid an assertion by Tony Elumelu, chairman of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc that Nigeria is \u201closing over 95 percent of oil production to thieves\u201d.\n\nAvuru, in a report, titled \u201cReining in the Collapse of the Nigerian Oil Industry\u201d published by the Africa Oil+Gas Report, called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe urged regulators and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to set up a \u201cwar room\u201d strategy to develop a plan to return the oil sector to \u201cfull bloom\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith eyes fixed on divestments and exit, the IOCs have not made any meaningful investments in the last fifteen years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe result has not just been declining production. Much worse, the entire export pipeline network has been surrendered to vandals and illegal bunkerers. Thus, the phrase \u201cCrude theft\u201d which crept into the industry about 2010 has taken on a new meaning.\n\n\u201cThere are some pipeline systems now (particularly in the East), where 80% (eighty percent) of production injected therein does not make it to the terminal!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, almost every producer is now cooking up \u201calternative evacuation\u201d schemes that cost four to five times what pipeline export would normally cost!\n\n\u201cThe stark reality today is that the IOCs are leaving. Their decision to leave is outside our control as a nation. In fact, over the last twelve years, Shell and Chevron have divested from a total of twenty-one blocks. It is now public knowledge that Shell and ExxonMobil are now exiting the onshore/shallow water altogether,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, my projection is that, by Christmas day of 2025, TOTAL would be the only IOC in J.V with NNPC.\n\n\u201cThe situation is the same with domestic gas delivery. Even though we are weaving all the right slogans about the future of gas in Nigeria, in the past five years, I can only point at a couple of Nigerian independents who are investing in gas development and processing for the domestic market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe state of the NNPC Towers in Abuja, headquarters of the Nigerian oil industry: Just standing back and intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution to the question of retreating IOCs Nigerian Petroleum Industry is a National Emergency. Oil production is down to about 1.4Million barrels per day and declining and this includes about 600,000BOPD from the deepwater.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas production has stagnated at about 1.2Billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day over the past five years at a time when projected production should have been 3.5Bcf per day. The collateral impact of course, is the low level of power generation which itself has stagnated at about 4,000Mega watts per day since 2015.\u201d\n\nAvuru added that the full impact of the current oil production level can only be imagined when oil prices return to the $60 per barrel level.\n\n\u201cI dare repeat that the situation has to be treated as a national emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetween the upstream regulator (the commission) and NNPC, they need to set up a \u201cwar room\u201d, some form of an effective task force to develop a blueprint for returning the industry to full bloom. The responses we hear today to the myriad of problems outlined above have been ad-hoc, knee jerk and in some cases only self-serving.\u201d\n\nAvuru outlined some issues that must be addressed in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen IOCs leave a matured petroleum patch, independents, whether local or international, usually move in to inject fresh capital, run a nimble efficient operation and maximize production and reserves addition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cA well-organised transition driven by a clear policy direction, from the retreating IOCs to a crop of efficient independents with the requisite resources will have to be implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJust standing back and intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution proffered by NNPC.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains. Eighty percent of our remaining reserves are still in this belt.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we have to address the twin problems of reliable pipeline evacuation and community restiveness. These problems have become heightened, not because there is no solution, but because we have abandoned every attention to them in the last fifteen years.\n\n\u201cWhen these two problems are tackled, plus a strict application of the \u201cdrill or drop\u201d provisions of the new PIA, huge investments in drilling and facilities revamp will flow again into this terrain.\n\n\u201cFinally, we have to match our gas slogans with effective, measurable, policy actions to drive investments in domestic gas supply. The current flip-flops on pricing and commercial structure of the gas business cannot stimulate investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cThis industry will not wake up by God\u2019s miracle. We have to wake up and design the stimulant that will revitalise it.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) had said the country loses more than 115,000 barrels per day to oil theft and vandalism.\n\nTheCable had reported that oil producers in Nigeria lamented oil thieves are raking in \u2018petrodollars\u2019 while Nigeria is bedeviled by low production.\n\nIn February, Nigeria\u2019s oil production had dropped to an average of 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.39 million the previous month.",

Equiano is expected to land in South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena later in the year, connecting the continent with Europe.\n\nThis announcement marks a milestone in Google\u2019s plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Last October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa, of which project Equiano is part of.\n\nMap of Africa indicating Lisbon, Togo, and Cape Town landings with branching units\n\nFor Togo which currently ranks as the sixth-best country in Africa regarding ease of doing business, the landing of Equiano opens up more possibilities and opportunities. It\u2019s expected that once connected to Equiano, it will provide 20 times more bandwidth than any other cable currently serving West Africa, helping Togo attract even more investments and further boosting its vibrant startup culture.\n\n\u201cBroadening the access to high-speed internet is a fundamental part in our national digital development process as we strive towards achieving the objectives set out in our Digital 2025 Strategy,\u201d Cina Lawson, Minister of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation for Togo said.\n\nAccording to an economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo from Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics, it is estimated that the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional USD 351 million during the same period.\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa commented, \u201cThe landing of Equiano affirms Google\u2019s commitment to the African continent, to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

They gain a better understanding of business processes and meet individuals with similar interests. It wasn\u2019t different this time, and the event kicked off by 5:15 p.m.\n\nProviding credit financing for Africans\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the first entrepreneur \u2014 Dayo Oyekanmi \u2014 stepped up to pitch his startup \u2014 Harmony. Harmony plans to play in the increasingly competitive buy now, pay later industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyekanmi shared that it plans to focus on providing credit financing for its consumers. Rather than hold inventory, the startup will assess data provided by a prospective customer to determine how much credit they can extend. Currently running its private beta, the startup also plans to issue credit cards that will be used to shop at partner merchants.\n\nEmergency responses for Nigerians\n\nThe second person to pitch was Oluwafemi Adeleke. His startup, Siara, plans to provide emergency response and security services for Nigerians using a community model. Unlike Harmony, Adeleke disclosed that Siara had not launched but was still in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nProviding feedback to entrepreneurs is an integral part of Pitch Friday. Occasionally, entrepreneurs whose business models are still unclear get more clarity from questions asked by the audience.\n\nAfter the two entrepreneurs had pitched, they got questions and feedback from a highly engaged audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Oyekanmi, many of the questions revolved around the risk management and profitability of the business. He explained that the startup uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess a customer\u2019s capability to repay a loan while clarifying that it intends to focus on credit financing.\n\nWith Siara appearing to be offering too many services, the audience grilled Adeleke on the startup\u2019s core proposition.\n\nWhen the event ended at 6:30 p.m., participants hung around to meet each other. April\u2019s edition of Pitch Friday will be held on Friday, April 8, 2022, and you can register to pitch your startup or join the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nEver heard of the term, Hope as a Service? Well, me neither. At least until last Wednesday when we recorded the latest Techpoint Africa Podcast. I think it\u2019s a perfect phrase, though, and if you render that service or know someone who does, please point me in the right direction.\n\nIf the term confuses you, you should listen to last week\u2019s Podcast. Find it on your preferred streaming service here. (Please click \u201cIgnore\u201d when you get the warning)\n\nIn today\u2019s Digest, we have:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nthe Internet: one word connecting Google, MTN, and Ethiopia, and\n\nWaitlisting as a marketing strategy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Equiano lands in Togo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google. Source: Supplied\n\nLet\u2019s start with an image: You\u2019re in the kitchen, standing over your sink, with a bowl in it and the tap running. For some reason, you\u2019re lost in thought, and you forget to turn off the faucet. Soon, everywhere is overflowing with water, and you still don\u2019t turn it off.\n\nWhy the analogy, though? Well, Google\u2019s subsea Internet cable \u2014 Equiano \u2014 has landed in Togo. The company announced this on Friday, March 18, 2022, and said it has partnered with ex-Google project, CSquared.\n\nStay with me a bit: First announced in 2019, Equiano is a 100 terabit fibre optic cable from Portugal to South Africa, with landing points in Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena and will connect Africa with Europe. As of 2021, the West and East African coasts each had cables with an Internet capacity of at least 100 Tbps.\n\nAdd Google\u2019s Equiano, and this becomes 300 Tbps. Technically, this should automatically mean faster Internet, right?\n\nNot so fast: However, the reality is, out of an available 100 million megabits per second, Ghana \u2014 the highest ranking African country for fixed broadband \u2014 has a speed of 53.28 megabits per second.\n\nWhy so tiny? Lack of Internet infrastructure. It\u2019s one thing for an Internet subsea cable to land on your shores, and it\u2019s another for it to get to where it\u2019s needed.\n\nHere\u2019s where the analogy comes back: Think of this as that bowl (Africa) overflowing with water (subsea Internet cables). The tap isn\u2019t turned off, and the wasted water is not helpful to anyone.\n\nHere\u2019s a handy explainer if you want to know more: Subsea Internet cables and the race to connect Africa to the Internet\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has a plan: CSquared provides fibre infrastructure that helps connect the Internet coming from subsea cables to where they are needed. So, this partnership with CSquared in Togo could mean that Google\u2019s Equiano\u2019s cable actually does the good it is intended to do.\n\nThere\u2019s also a boring backstory here of the government working together with CSquared to form CSquared Woezon, but there\u2019s also a bit more exciting news.\n\nNew jobs! According to Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics\u2019s economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo, the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional $351m during the same period. It also brings 20 times more bandwidth than any cable currently serving West Africa.\n\nWho\u2019s next? Word on the street says the cable will land in Nigeria next, then Namibia, and after South Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Eastern part of the continent, Ethiopia\u2019s government plans to sell part of its stake in Ethio Telecom have hit another snag. The country\u2019s Ministry of Finance announced this on Friday, March 18, 2022, and gave no definite date on when the process will continue. The race to commercialise one of the world\u2019s last state-owned monopolies is still on.\n\nElsewhere, MTN\u2019s bid to secure spectrum in South Africa has been successful. On Thursday, March 17, 2022, the telecom giant revealed that it had spent $347 million in the controversial Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) auction as it looks to expand its 4G and 5G coverage in South Africa.\n\nCurrently, MTN\u2019s 4G network supposedly covers 96% of the South African population. This spectrum allocation could mean more reach, coverage, and speeds.\n\nNigeria\u2019s electricity woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, March 14, 2022, Nigeria\u2019s National electric grid collapsed, plunging many citizens into darkness. Barely 24 hours later, it collapsed once more on Tuesday.\n\nThe chart above shows the daily amount of energy generated as at Wednesday, March 16, 2022.\n\nWant a little more context? You can check out this article by BusinessDay\u2019s Oladehinde Oladipo\n\nTo see interesting statistics and charts like this, please, follow Techpoint Intelligence at @techpointintel on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nWaitlisting as a startup marketing strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just have to chip in that this heading reads like a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. But then, away from Internet speeds and millions of dollars, we are moving on to waitlists.\n\nWhat is a waitlist? It is a marketing strategy used to create a sense of exclusivity while generating a buzz around a new product or service. For example, ABC company wants to launch a new and exciting product. So, they advertise the product and ask people to join a waitlist \u2014 basically fill in their names and email addresses \u2014 to be among the first new users.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably had to join a waitlist once or twice in the past few months. You also probably forgot about the product at some point, didn\u2019t you? So what\u2019s the hype around waitlists recently, and how can you use them correctly?\n\nWe had a chat with Ized Uanikhehi, Founder, Zedi Africa; Peace Obinani, Product Marketing Manager, PiggyVest; and Oluwaferanmi Ajetomobi, Co-founder, Ni Fries to answer some questions on when and why you should use a waitlist, how you should use it, privacy implications, among other things.\n\nFirst thing I can tell you for free is, don\u2019t forget to build the product you advertised while creating your waitlist. Things could get a little problematic.\n\nCatch up on our conversation here, and don\u2019t forget to watch out for our next Twitter Spaces in April.\n\nTechpoint Africa stories last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nMy week was relatively barren music-wise, but I can certainly recommend the latest Techpoint Africa Podcast this fine Monday morning. You can listen here (Please click \u201cIgnore\u201d when you get the warning)\n\nI found this story about this TikToker who moved into his office oddly hilarious. P.S. He got fired.\n\nI have no idea how I understood this article, but I did \u2014 another thing I found oddly hilarious this weekend.\n\nThis week was about finding things hilarious.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

I appeal to all to take this window of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of having your plans are huge as your property is recorded and identified as a legal property on Edo soil and the conveyance letter which is like a legal document is issued to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsure your building is captured at this time as the Ministry is very cooperative and the exercise will continue every Thursday, Friday and Saturday,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, The Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Stephen Idehenre said the state will flag off its farming season on Thursday, March 25, 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe State Government will be flagging off the farming season on Thursday, 25th of March 2022. This year\u2019s farming season should be taken seriously as there will be an interface between farmers and off-takers. The government will provide motorbikes for extension workers to get feedback from extension officers.\u201d\n\nIdehenre further disclosed that since the outbreak of the Lassa fever in Edo, the state has recorded 160 cases and 20 deaths, representing a 13 percent death rate in the state.\n\n\u201cThe disease is a pandemic that is still ravaging some communities across local government areas in Edo State. I call all to join hands with the relevant authority to manage and keep the environment clean.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "South-West politicians from the Congress for Progressive Change bloc in the All Progressives Congress are set to lose out at the national convention following their rejection by governors in the region, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThe defunct CPC bloc is made up of politicians, who joined Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to merge with the Action Congress of Nigeria to form the APC in 2013 before he won the 2015 presidential election.\n\nAccording to Punch, a former Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, who is running for the national secretary of the APC; and the Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding, Ife Oyedele, were being resisted by the APC governors in the South-West.\n\nIt was also learnt that a former Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Iyiola Omisore, might be endorsed as the national secretary ahead of a former Oyo State Commissioner for Finance, Zaccheus Adedeji.\n\nAlso, Dayo Israel was tipped to emerge as the national youth leader of the APC. It is also believed that the unity list of the South-West governors was expected to be released in the coming days.\n\nA top source in the APC said, \u201cThere are attempts by some people in Abuja to impose some of the CPC elements on the South-West. Let me restate that the governors are the leaders of the party. We have met and have micro-zoned the positions given to our region.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate any interference from outside. Shittu, Oyedele and others have lost out completely.\u201d\n\nExternal forces trying to impose persons on S\u2019West, says Akeredolu\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, who is also the Chairman, South-West Governors\u2019 Forum, said the governors had agreed on micro-zoning, adding that those scheming from outside the region were only trying to cause confusion.\n\nAkeredolu said in the statement titled, \u2018External forces trying to impose persons on South-West\u2019, that a former Chairman of the APC in the state, Isaac Kekemeke, had been endorsed as the national vice chairman for the South-West.\n\nThe statement by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, stated that all the governors of the South-West had endorsed Kekemeke.\n\nIt read in part, \u201cThis is to confirm that one of our own, the former APC state chairman, Duerimini Isaac Kekemeke, is in the race for the position of the National Vice-Chairman (South-West). Kekemeke has the full backing of Governor Akeredolu and his brother governors in the South-West.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that critical stakeholders in the South-West had earlier micro-zoned the positions that were brought to the region. Among these were the national vice-chairman, which was retained in Ondo, and the secretary, which was micro-zoned to the Oyo/Osun axis.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, what we are going for is national vice-chairman with Kekemeke as our candidate, and not national secretary. Those outside the South-West, who are attempting to micro-zone our offices for us in the South-West, are only creating unnecessary confusion and any such of their permutations outside the decision of stakeholders in the South-West should be ignored.\u201d",

So, we don\u2019t expect our men to disturb Nigerians on this.\n\n\u201cWe are to stop any vehicle with tints, search the vehicle, and its occupants, but not to delay him for not having tinted glass permits. Report them if you are so delayed so that we ask them (the personnel) questions.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Again, Gunmen Attack, Raze Police Station In Imo\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Die In Silence\u2019\n\nAccording to him, police personnel at checkpoints and on routine patrols are only allowed to demand vehicle licences, driver\u2019s licences, and certificates of insurance, especially for private car owners.\n\nHe stressed that requesting the allocation of number papers from car owners was unnecessary, especially when such vehicles have been registered.\n\nAdejobi asked car owners who fall victim to erring police personnel to contact the force through its phone lines 08057000001 and 08057000002 \u2013 for calls, 08057000003 \u2013 for text message and WhatsApp, or via Twitter \u2013 @PoliceNG_CRU of email \u2013 [email protected].\n\n\u201cAny policeman demanding for more; it\u2019s a deviant (act) and he must be dealt with. If not, many Nigerians will suffer from him and his likes,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t die in silence, speak out to save yourself and others. I will speak on this issue soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease take note that the police don\u2019t demand allocation of number paper, it\u2019s not necessary since a vehicle has been registered. All you need to have with you are the three I mentioned \u2013 vehicle licence, certificate of insurance, and driver\u2019s licence. Simple.\u201d",

They really force evacuate our people to Russia,\u201d Andryushenko said.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these accusations.\n\nMariupol is a key strategic target for Russia and has seen some of the invasion\u2019s fiercest fighting, with Russian forces so far failing to take the city from its defenders.\n\nPrevious efforts to evacuate Mariupol\u2019s civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city.\n\nPresident Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a \u201cwar crime\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally deliberate tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an \u2018argument\u2019 for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers\u201d.\n\nThe location of the port city, on the Sea of Azov, makes it a strategic target for Russia, as it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Avuru, Co-Founder Seplat Energy, Calls for State of Emergency in Oil Sector, Says 80% of Crude Stolen",
          "text": "A Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru has called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru\u2019s comments came few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal. Elumelu has his oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nElumelu also chairs the Board of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), holds a controlling interest in Transnational Corporation (Transcorp) and runs Trans-Niger Oil & Gas Limited (TNOG).\n\nThe owner of TNOG, which recently bought 45 per cent of Oil Mining Licence (OML) 17, argued that oil theft was generally responsible for Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota.\n\n\u201cHow can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000bpd barrels of crude oil daily, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator, Shell to declare force majeure,\u201d he had lamented.\n\nBut writing for Africa Oil & Gas Report, Avuru, who is the Founder/ Executive Chairman, AA Holdings and Vice Chairman Platform Petroleum, maintained that as far as 1990, Nigeria\u2019s average daily oil production was about 1.85 million barrels per day when the country\u2019s oil reserves at the time stood at about 16 billion barrels.\n\nHowever, he deplored the current situation in which Nigeria cannot meet the quota allocated by OPEC and had been struggling to produce 1.4 million barrels per day. He argued that aside theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil, with eyes fixed on divestments and exit, the International Oil Companies (IOCs) have not made any meaningful investments in the sector in the last 15 years, with the result being the current declining production.\n\n\u201cMuch worse, the entire export pipeline network has been surrendered to vandals and illegal \u2018bunkerers\u2019. Thus, the phrase \u2018crude theft\u2019 which crept into the industry about 2010 has taken on a new meaning.\n\n\u201cThere are some pipeline systems now (particularly in the East) where 80 per cent of production injected therein does not make it to the terminal! Almost every producer is now cooking up alternative evacuation schemes that cost four to five times what pipeline export would normally cost,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAvuru noted that while the decision to leave by the IOCs was outside Nigeria\u2019s control, the country\u2019s delay in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) ensured that investment in the sector dried up a long time ago.\n\n\u201cIn fact, my projection is that, by Christmas day of 2025, Total would be the only IOC in Joint Venture (JV) with the NNPC,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the situation was not different with domestic gas delivery, adding that even though Nigeria continues to weave all the right slogans about the future of gas in Nigeria, in the past five years, he could only point at a couple of Nigerian independents who are investing in gas development and processing for the domestic market.\n\n\u201cThe state of the Nigerian petroleum industry is a national emergency. Oil production is down to about 1.4 million barrels per day and declining and this includes about 600,000BOPD from the deep water.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas production has stagnated at about 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day over the past five years at a time when projected production should have been 3.5Bcf per day. The collateral impact of course, is the low level of power generation which itself has stagnated at about 4,000 megawatts per day since 2015,\u201d the businessman said.\n\nOn recommendations, Avuru stressed that between the upstream regulator (the commission) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), they need to set up a, \u201cwar room\u201d, or some form of an effective task force to develop a blueprint for returning the industry to full bloom.\n\n\u201cThe responses we hear today to the myriad of problems outlined above have been ad-hoc, knee jerk and in some cases only self-serving. I dare repeat that the situation has to be treated as a national emergency,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe argued that a well-organised transition driven policy direction, from the retreating IOCs\u2019 needs to be developed, noting that intervening by pre-emptive acquisitions cannot be a sustainable solution proffered by the NNPC.\u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains. Eighty per cent of our remaining reserves are still in this belt.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we have to address the twin problems of reliable pipeline evacuation and community restiveness. These problems have become heightened, not because there is no solution, but because we have abandoned every attention to them in the last 15 years.\n\n\u201cWhen these two problems are tackled, plus a strict application of the \u2018drill or drop\u2019 provisions of the new PIA, huge investments in drilling and facilities revamp will flow again into this terrain.\n\n\u201cFinally, we have to match our gas slogans with effective, measurable, policy actions to drive investments in domestic gas supply. The current flip-flops on pricing and commercial structure of the gas business cannot stimulate investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cThis industry will not wake up by God\u2019s miracle. We have to wake up and design the stimulant that will revitalise it,\u201d Avuru said.\n\nSylva: Nigeria Will Not Support Single Track Energy Transition Strategy\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, said yesterday that Nigeria was not in support of any narrative that supports a single lane energy transition strategy.\n\nThe minister insisted that Nigeria would remain at the vanguard of the crusade for a multifaceted energy transition timetable that will attract more investments for Africa, while taking cognisance of the current global drive towards renewables.\n\nA statement by the Senior Adviser (Media & Communications) to the minister, Horatius Egua, quoted Sylva as having made the declaration on the heels of a collective decision by African petroleum and energy ministers to present a common voice at COP 27, in Egypt.\n\nThe minister insisted that Africa should be allowed to continue to exploit its hydrocarbon deposits for the development of the continent, rather than being stampeded into a process which does not fully benefit its people.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to drive the direction of the narrative for the African energy transition programme. We have stood out to say \u2018no\u2019 to a single track energy transition programme.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to support a transition agenda that will promote gas and renewed investments in the hydrocarbons sector for Africa,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAccording to the statement, Sylva, and the Egyptian Energy Minister, Terek el Molla had been the main voices in articulating a multi-track approach to the energy transition programme for Africa.\n\n\u201cBoth leaders are of the view that for the energy transition programme to be meaningful, Africa must be factored into the global energy transition programme in such a way that takes care of the peculiar African situation.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to advocate for gas as a transition fuel for Africa. We have said that we cannot move at the same pace with the rest of the world because we contribute less than two per cent of the global greenhouse gas emission. We are not the problem and we cannot be made to pay for the sins we did not commit,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister added that for anyone to say Africa should abandon its abundant hydrocarbon deposits for the uncertainties of renewable energy was most unfair.\n\nHe noted that as at today, there are still people without clean cooking fuels in Africa, explaining that over 600 million people are without basic energy.\n\n\u201cSo, how do we meet their energy base load? We can only achieve this through gas. It\u2019s only through a multi-pronged approach that we can achieve this. It is obvious that we cannot move at the same pace with the rest of the world as far as the energy transition programme is concerned,\u201d he maintained.\n\nAt the just concluded CERAweek, in Houston, United States of America, the statement noted that Sylva and el Molla led other African ministers to meetings where they resolved to project a common front in the energy transition timetable for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge hydrocarbon deposits in the continent and must we abandon it because some people have said we should? Some African countries like Ghana, Angola and others are just coming to the table and should they just abandon what they have because some countries are saying we should develop renewable energy? That will be an unfair decision.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying we won\u2019t be part of the transition train for renewable energy but what we are saying as Africans is that we should be allowed to develop our natural resources and enjoy the God-given resources.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the world is beginning to listen to Africa and we are happy about that and we intend to build on that momentum at COP 27 in Egypt by coming out with a common position,\u201d he noted.",

For this reason, we decided that we should all embrace consensus going forward in order to make things easier for our party\u2019s stability,\u201d Saraki stated.\n\nHe pointed out that their convergence, taking cognizance of the sorry state of the country and its people, which the APC was not ready to alleviate, was convinced that the PDP must lead the way in the march to rescue the country in 2023.\n\nHe said although all of them seeking the number one position were all qualified to contest, \u201cWe are ready to sacrifice our ambitions. We have agreed to put our heads together and see how best to provide leadership and direction for this country, its unity, stability and progress.\n\n\u201cThese are more important than our individual ambitions, thus, the need for us to work together. Today, is momentous. The PDP is ready, because what is important is Nigeria. Whatever we do, Nigeria should come first,\u201d the former Senate President further added.\n\nWhile Governor Tambuwal was accompanied by a former Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, and a Chieftain of the PDP in Sokoto State, Bello Suleiman, Saraki came along with a former national chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje and others.\n\nThe Deputy Governor of Bauchi State, Baba Tela, was also present at the press briefing.",
