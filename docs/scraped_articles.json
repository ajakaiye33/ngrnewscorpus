          "title": "Reps invite INEC over funding challenge for direct primaries",
          "text": "In a bid to ensure that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), signs the Electoral Act Amendment bill along with the controversial mandatory direct primaries, some National Assembly members have expressed willingness to approve a loan for the Federal Government to fund the election should the budget surpass N500bn as being speculated.\n\nThis is just as the House invited the Independent National Electoral Commission over funding challenges for direct primaries.\n\nThe National Assembly had on November 9, 2021, passed the bill which makes it mandatory for all political parties to elect candidates through direct primaries.\n\nThe bill was subsequently transmitted to the President on November 19 and is expected to sign it or return it to the National Assembly by December 19.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the President had written a letter to the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, seeking comment from INEC over the Electoral Act amendment bill.\n\nINEC National Commissioner for Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye, had told The PUNCH that the direct primaries would cost a lot more especially in terms of personnel. A tally by The PUNCH also showed that due to inflation, exchange rate and other related issues, the budget could surpass N350bn.\n\nHowever, some other reports have it that the cost could be as high as N500bn. The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), had repeatedly stated that Buhari would consider economic and security factors as well as the general interest of Nigerians before signing or withdrawing assent to the bill.\n\nBut the House of Representatives on Thursday said it was willing to allocate the needed funds to INEC to supervise the direct primaries to be conducted by political parties in the election of candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe House, therefore, invited the INEC chairman to come and make it known to the parliament what it would cost the country to conduct direct primaries for all parties.\n\nThe House is to make the provision in the 2022 Appropriation Bill which is under consideration by the National Assembly.\n\nAt the plenary on Thursday, the lawmaker representing Yagba-East/Yagba-West/Mopa-Muro Federal Constituency in Kogi State, Leke Abejide, moved a motion of urgent public importance to urge the House to invite INEC to declare the cost, \u201cso that all the insinuations that that are going around can be cleared to the whole nation.\u201d\n\nBefore the lawmaker moved the motion, he met with the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila,\n\nAfter Abejide left, the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa; and Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, also met with Gbajabiamila at the Speaker\u2019s seat.\n\nMoving the motion, Abejide said the INEC chairman should \u201cbrief the Committee on INEC and Appropriations because now that we are considering the (2022) appropriation that is still within the National Assembly for possible consideration for whatever it is going to cost for these direct primaries.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added, \u201cWe are all aware of the importance of direct primary and how it will transfer power to the real people, where they will be able to select or elect the people that will represent them from the Presidency down to the councillorship. And there has been a lot of noise about the cost implications.\n\n\u201cPeople have been saying that it will gulp N500bn but this is just hearsay, nobody has ever sat down to check the actual cost that it is going to cost the nation. It may be something that is within the capacity of the budget of INEC or something that we can even appropriate for, in this period that we are still considering this budget.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important for us to invite the chairman of INEC to meet with the Committees on INEC in this hallowed chamber, and that on appropriations, for him to be able to tell them what is going to cost to do this direct primary.\u201d\n\nA lawmaker, who wished to remain anonymous, said a loan could be granted to ensure that INEC can execute its budget.\n\n\u201cNo amount of money is too much to ensure that we have credible elections. Since we already grant loans for government projects, nothing stops us from approving loans for the execution of the election. Some of us are even willing to sacrifice the N100bn yearly constituency project fund to ensure that direct primary is adopted,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent members of the House of Representatives told one of our correspondents that Nigeria would go ahead with direct primary, no matter the cost.\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, direct primary is a critical step towards strengthening the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Finance, James Faleke, whose committee had always criticised the ministries, departments and agencies of the Federal Government for failing in their revenue generation and remittance towards reducing budget deficit and borrowings, stated that no amount is too much to protect democracy.\n\nFaleke said, \u201cHow much is too much for democracy to prevail? We spend a little money to ensure that there are free and fair elections in this country from beginning to the end. Is it too much for Nigerians to accommodate? If there is no democracy, can there be free votes? So, for me, I think that the cost of direct primary is too minimal \u2013 too minimal \u2013 to all the other expenses and budget heads that we have.\n\n\u201cHow much is direct primary? How much does it cost to do it? And what is this cost you are talking about? It is just supervised by INEC. And it is not (held) all year round, it is once (in four years). For example, if the APC wants to do primaries\u2026APC and the PDP are the only two parties that have spread across the country. So, the cost of conducting primaries\u2026the cost of supervising APC and PDP\u2019s primaries is too small for us to jettison that bill.\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking separately with The PUNCH, the Chairman of the House Committee on Customs and Excise, Leke Abejide, stated that INEC had yet to announce what it would cost it to supervise primaries of the parties.\n\n\u201cWe want to know what is going to cost them (INEC) if they are going to handle it. We have done our investigation, it is even less than N100bn. But we want to hear from them; let it come from INEC so that people will know that it is not what they are calling it. Let us hear from them and everybody will be at peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAbejide also stated direct primary is the best. He said, \u201cWe have previously tried indirect. At the end of the day, the party, if care is not taken, will scatter. You see people doing protest votes because the wrong candidates have been imposed on them and they don\u2019t want the candidates. But if all the people in that political party happen to choose a candidate, they will be happy to vote for him (or her at the election).\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAgain, why it is even good for INEC to be involved is because it should not be a kangaroo primary. If INEC is involved, it will now be a real primary whereby the votes will count. It is not that somebody will just sit down in their office and just write down names and figures.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the government has the capacity to fund the mode of primary, Abejide said, \u201cYes, we can. If it is within N100bn. We can.\u201d\n\nOn what if it cost N500bn as is being speculated, the lawmaker said, \u201cEven with N200bn, we can still afford it.\u201d\n\nAbejide stated that what is more important is having quality leadership in the country that can truly serve the people.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

If the Kaduna SUBEB wants to assess the performance of our members, it should follow them to the class and assess them while they are teaching pupils,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe NUT National Executive Council had on Nov. 18 directed its members in Kaduna State not to participate in the competency test organised by the state government.\n\nThe Deputy National President of the union, Mr Kelvin Nwankwo, who gave the directive, insisted that teachers\u2019 competence had been proved by various accredited universities and colleges of education.\n\nHe stressed that the teachers were also tested before they were hired.\n\nAccording to him, the NUT affirms and relies on the provisions of Section 1(d) of the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) Act 2004, which made provisions for the regulation and control of the teaching profession.\n\n\u201cAs teachers who belong to a professional body, registered and licensed, we shall only subject ourselves to any professional recommendation issued by our Regulatory Council, and to no other body,\u2019\u2019 Nwankwo said.\n\nNAN reports that the list of the affected teachers provided by the Kaduna SUBEB shows that 210 out of the 233 affected teachers claimed to have obtained their certificates at the National Teachers Institute, Kaduna.\n\nKaduna SUBEB\u2019s Executive Chairman, Mr Tijjani Abdullahi, had announced earlier on Thursday that the board would sack 233 primary school teachers for allegedly presenting fake certificates.\n\nAbdullahi said the board would forward the files of affected teachers to the Ministry of Justice for prosecution.\n\nThe SUBEB boss also disclosed that the board would conduct competency tests for primary school teachers as part of the continued assessment of their capacity to ensure quality teaching.",

You can change the narrative, you can create a legacy that will outlast you and the region, or maybe at the barest minimum your village, but I think you should aim beyond Niger Delta, aim to be the best in the world, it is possible.\u201d\n\nThe President of NAPASW, Lucky Ukueku, thanked Dikio for his encouragement and for giving them the opportunity to air their views, noting that it was impactful and educational.\n\nHe appealed to the interim administrator to review the welfare status of the amnesty students in their schools, among other things.",

          "text": "The 10th substantive Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), Prof. Lilian Salami, yesterday declared that the October 5 rape of a female student by a randy senior lecturer, Dr. Bode Ekundayo, in his office, would not be condoned.\n\nSalami, addressing a news conference at the Senate Chambers of UNIBEN to mark her second anniversary as the helmsman, alleged that it was the height of indiscipline for the senior lecturer in the Department of English and Literature, Faculty of Arts, to rape the 400 level/final year student.\n\nThe vice chancellor said Ekundayo was on interdiction, pending the conclusion of investigation by the police.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur mandate is not to investigate rape cases. We queried the lecturer for kidnapping and forcing the female student to remain in his office. We reported rape to the police.\n\n\u201cThe incident (rape) happened and the lecturer was placed on interdiction, pending the outcome of police investigation. We cannot do police job. They (police) have to do their job efficiently and effectively.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was learnt that the same Ekundayo was involved in sex-for-marks scandal a little over two years ago, but he managed to wriggle out of it.\n\nEdo police spokesman Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP), through the phone, said the command would ensure investigation of the rape allegation and possible prosecution of the senior lecturer, if found culpable.\n\nEkundayo allegedly raped the final year female undergraduate, who was in his office for project supervision. He begged for forgiveness, after the video went viral on the social media.\n\nImmediately after the rape, Ekundayo locked the student in his office for some hours, refusing to let her go, against her wish, while the undergraduate had to contact her unnamed friend, narrating where she was and what transpired. The friend, with the assistance of UNIBEN\u2019s security operatives, rescued her.\n\nThe lecturer was arrested by UNIBEN\u2019s security officials, taken to the university\u2019s administrative block, questioned and he admitted to committing the crime, while he was subsequently handed over to the police for investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThe decisions of the authorities of the university, according to its spokesperson, Dr. Benedicta Ehanire, later in a statement in Benin, were in line with internal mechanisms, as contained in the 2017 regulations governing the service of senior workers of the higher institution.\n\nEhanire said: \u201cA security report of preliminary investigation into alleged rape and detention of a 400 Level female student in the Department of English and Literature, UNIBEN, by a lecturer in the department, has been submitted to the management of the university.\n\n\u201cConsidering the gravity of the allegations and legal issues involved, the matter has been referred to the police for further investigation.\n\n\u201cManagement is, however, not oblivious of its responsibility of ensuring proper conduct by the workers and students of the university.\u201d\n\nThe authorities of UNIBEN assured workers, students, parents and other stakeholders that the investigation would be pursued to its logical conclusion, to ensure that justice was served.\n\nProsecuting Ekundayo will be in line with Criminal Code of Nigeria, sections 357 and 358, which frowned at having unlawful access, carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, without her consent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by force or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of harm after a confirmation, and if, the victim will like to go ahead seeking justice in no distance time.\n\nUNIBEN\u2019s VC, while further speaking yesterday on the case of a female alumnus of the university, who wore a T-shirt with an inscription: \u201cCheating Brought Me This Far,\u201d noted that the lady was facing a disciplinary committee, with due process being followed.\n\nShe noted that her administration had not increased school fees, in spite of the funding challenge, disclosing that 30 per cent of UNIBEN\u2019s Internally-Generated Revenue (IGR) was being used to pay contractors. She pleaded for their understanding.\n\nSalami said students are now enjoying almost 24 hours electricity and water supplies.\n\nShe urged them to be serious with their studies and give peace a chance.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Aidoghie Paulinus, Fred Ezeh and Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja\n\nAnxiety has gripped Nigerians following the reported detection of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, in the country.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) revealed, yesterday, that the variant was detected in the cause of its genomic surveillance for inbound international travelers arriving in the country at its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja and network of other testing laboratories.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIts Director General, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, in a statement, explained that samples obtained for the stipulated day two test for travelers to Nigeria were positive for the variant in three persons with history of travel to South Africa.\n\nHowever, he said from a technical perspective, a travel ban would not be recommended because it is not not driven by science.\n\n\u201cWe are currently the subject of travel ban ourselves for reason that are not driven by science and as we know, recent information from the Netherlands showed cases of these variants before the South Africans did. A travel ban is not the way to go at the moment, what we need is enhanced surveillance, vigilance and for our population to adhere to recommended safety measures. At the last count, over 22 countries have reported this variant, so where would the banning end if you start?\n\n\u201cTwenty four hours before, we said with great confidence that there were no Omicron variant in the country, which was correct because we depended on the state of results at the time. Surveillance is an ongoing activity and we continue to generate results from the laboratory on a daily basis. The update was correct at the time the press release was issued and we would not be surprised if we find more cases as we continue to sequence all of the samples that continue to accrue. This is reflective of the situation worldwide because the number of countries that are importing this variants continue to increase.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the measures that we have in place, we will continue to enhance surveillance as is recommended at this time and we had to conduct a risk based assessment of transmission. We have to look at travelers and ensure they abide by the travel advisory. We have made the day two tests compulsory for everyone regardless of the status of vaccination. We are not focusing on Southern African countries, we are giving attention to all travelers coming into the country. Most cases with this variant are mild and we have not recorded any fatalities.\u201d\n\nThis came as Cyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa called for the reversal of travel restrictions placed on African countries over fears of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nHe said the discriminatory restrictions would have long-lasting effects on the economies of the affected countries.\n\nThe United Kingdom, European Union and the United States are among those that have imposed a travel ban on South Africa and its neighboring countries due to fears of Omicron. The Canadian government has also banned travellers from Nigeria and nine other African countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government made good its threat, yesterday, as civil servants and the general public without proof of vaccination and negative PCR tests were denied access in government buildings in Abuja.\n\nIn October, the Federal Government had mandated civil servants to get vaccinated.\n\nBoss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), had said workers who failed to get vaccinated would be barred from entering their places of work from December 1.\n\nSome civil servants who spoke with Daily Sun expressed worries over the compulsory vaccination since it does not stop one from contracting the the virus while others pleaded for more time to enable them do the needful.\n\nFlorence Adam, who works with one of the government offices around Area 11, confirmed she and others who had not taken the vaccine were not allowed into office.\n\n\u201cI never knew they were serious about it. I know we have failed on our own part because we deliberately refused to take the vaccine because they were all over. I even met some of them at my junction, yesterday, but refused to be vaccinated. I just want to plead with the Federal Government to give us more grace by extending the date and also increase the sensitisation because most people are being misinformed, especially by religious leaders.\u201d\n\nAnother civil servant, Alice Age, said COVID-19 vaccination was not supposed to be made compulsory.\n\n\u201cThough,I have taken it, I\u2019m still not convinced that there is anything thing like COVID-19. There is enough tension in the land. They should stop putting more on the poor masses.\u201d\n\nFriday Adanu pleaded with the government to extend the deadline.\n\n\u201cI came all the way from my state to submit a document in the federal secretariat but was denied access I have not taken my vaccine. It is very painful because the transport was even borrowed. I know it is not the government\u2019s fault but I\u2019m pleading with them to extend the deadline so that I can complete my mission in Abuja and go back and do the needful.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, raised the alarm that lack of vaccination by developing countries would provide a fertile ground for COVID-19 to mutate and threaten the progress already recorded even in developed countries.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, issued the warning in Madrid, Spain, on Wednesday at the 24th General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nRaging issues threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity, yesterday, dominated discussions as the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, and former Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, Attahiru Jega, decried the poor attention being paid to it by politicians.\n\nThe duo spoke at different fora in Abuja.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAt a summit on national unity organised in Abuja by National Prosperity Movement, Fayemi said: \u201cTo be sure, unity cannot endure where injustice, exclusion, inequity and marginalisation are embedded in the practice of governance. I have often shuddered at the spectacle whereby some among us who have been entrusted with leadership responsibility very easily slide into the role of ethno-regional champions, xenophobes, and zealots.\u201d\n\nThe Ekiti governor submitted that fostering unity in a context of multiple diversities requires fulsome attention to equity, justice, fair play, and merit.\n\nFayemi advised that \u201cwhile it is normal that leaders must have their ears to the ground and feel the pulse of the people who have elected them \u2013 imbibing, reproducing and spilling out raw and crude bile and pushing scorched earth solutions crosses the line of representation to become an exercise in the shirking of responsibility.\n\n\u201cUnlike the bulk of their followers, leaders are positioned and privileged to know that in matters of nation- and state-building, the world is far more complex than the simple and many a-times simplistic binary divisions that are frequently deployed to oppose black and white.\n\n\u201cLeaders must truly lead by using the broader, more complex, and better nuanced understanding they have to help moderate and modulate seasons of deep division in the polity, rather than becoming the ones who add fuel to a raging fire.\u201d\n\nDelivering the Keynote address, Jega berated all civilian administrations since 1999 for not doing enough to promote national unity.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the attention paid to the question of national unity and integration by successive military regimes has not been matched by successive civilian administrations. Except for sloganeering in the third republic, when former civilian president, Shehu Shagari as National Party of Nigeria\u2019s presidential candidate, and subsequently as president, popularised the slogan of \u2018One Nation, One Destiny\u2019, subsequent civilian administrations, especially since 1999 seem to have, more or less, presided over the undermining if not destruction of the bases and foundations of national unity and integration in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nJega submitted that national unity would only best be promoted through tolerance and accommodation of each other\u2019s differences, opinions, ethnic, religious and communal or even regional identities.\n\nHe believed that \u201cat the core of national unity are non-discriminatory relations whether at the personal or official levels. The sad thing is that in contemporary Nigeria, all these are in dire short supply.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at another forum, Governor Fayemi, also passed a damning verdict on the nation, saying not only is it in most unhealthy state, but also in the doldrums.\n\n\u201cFirst, we have to agree that indeed, Nigeria is sleeping and also agree that it is a giant. And when you have a giant, you can approach that giant from all sides. It is like an elephant. And I believe that is only the perspective from which many of us will approach the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cBut the Nigerian state is not in its most healthy state. There is no debate about that regardless of political persuasion, regardless of ethnic consideration, regardless of economic opportunities available or unavailable to individuals, our country is in the doldrums,\u201d he said at ThisNigeria annual lecture and Gold Prize in Abuja.\n\nFayemi, however, said in every adversity, there is always an opportunity, adding that it was the ability of Nigerians to identify what those opportunities were that would take Nigerians further in the nation-building journey.\n\nThe NGF chairman also said nation-building anywhere in the world does not happen by happenstance, saying it is a long, tortuous and arduous process.\n\n\u201cAnd it is not a 60-year process. Many countries have been at it for centuries and they are still in search of a more perfect union as the American constitution will put it. And that search must continue. However, we must see sights of progress along the way; we must be able to identify those shoots, those little incomes that will become tall oaks sooner, rather than later because for those of us who still, at least, saw that good Nigeria relatively speaking, we have a sense of what that country should be. We have a sense of what is expected of the largest country with black people in the world. And we also have a sense of the expectation that the world has of us which we clearly have not lived up to.\u201d\n\nFayemi said he was sure there was something in the mind of the writer of the lines in the second stanza of the national anthem when he put them together.\n\nHe stated that Nigerians can talk about unity as much as they liked, talk about national integration as much as they wanted and can lionise patriotism, but cannot build a country on the basis of iniquity, injustice, lack of fairness and expect unity to prevail.\n\nFayemi noted that Nigerians see possibilities all the time even when they are at the verge of hopelessness. He stated that what recently took place in Anambra was a miracle because many Nigerians already had come to the conclusion that Anambra was going to be a bloodbath but it turned out the other way round.\n\nHe gave kudos to the National Peace Committee convened by Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, and chaired by former military head of state, Abdulsalami Abubakar, including the people of Anambra and INEC.\n\nDelivering a lecture entitled: \u2018National Cohesion for Growth and Progress: The Nigeria Dilemma\u2019, Kukah said the conversation was not about the All Progressives Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but to achieve national cohesion.\n\nHe said to achieve national cohesion, Nigerians needed to have a reliable constitution which is encompassing.\n\n\u201cNigerians are angrier now more than before but we get nostalgic about the past, thinking Nigeria was better before now. But the truth is, we were less educated or exposed before now.\u201d\n\nWhile decrying the decline in the quality of leadership in the country, Kukah added that patriotism was not a product of exchange.\n\n\u201cWe have never suffered from psychological trauma than now. I have a moral duty to know what is right and wrong. It has never been this bad in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKukah also said going by happenings in the country, it was more important to be a Muslim than to be a northerner in terms of appointment.\n\n\u201cWe want peace. Even criminals want peace. But we are in despair in Nigeria. Something is wrong with Nigeria,\u201d Kukah also said.\n\nPublisher and Chief Executive Officer of ThisNigeria Newspaper, Eric Osagie, said the newspaper was set up to tell Nigerians the truth and at the end of the day, give Nigerians a platform to express their views.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

Dr. Alex Ekwueme was the Vice President while Chief Edwin Ume-Ezeoke was the Speaker, House of Representatives.\n\nIn his tribute on the transition of Dr Wayas, Senator Mark described him as a flamboyant, vibrant and distinguished parliamentarian who left his positive footprints in the sand of time.\n\nHe paid glowing tribute to Dr Wayas for his invaluable contributions especially his solid foundation for democracy and the legislature in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cSenator Wayas was a great nationalist. He was a parliamentarian per excellence. His diligence, honesty and uncommon dedication to the ideals of nationhood remains reference points.\n\n\u201cHe brought dignity and respect to the legislature by adhering to the rule of law, separation of power and collaborating with the executive arm of government without compromising the independence of the legislature\u201d.\n\nMark recalled the wise counsel he received from Dr Wayas while in office as the President of the Senate, adding, \u201cWayas was always handy anytime we had some knotty issues in the Senate.

He was a veteran and an institutional memory bank of the Nigerian legislature, and a key player in Nigeria\u2019s constitutional development, having Deputy Chairman of the National Constitutional Conference Commission, which midwifed the 1994/1995 Constitutional Conference.\n\n\u201cSenator Wayas gave his all to the nation, had a tempering effect on the polity and acquitted himself most creditable as a patriot, pan-Nigerian, and people-vested political icon and leader.\n\nAlso reacting to Wayas demise, the former Governor of Enugu state, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani described his death as a huge loss to the nation especially the political class.\n\nNnamani who represents Enugu East in the Senate noted that Dr. Wayas was a pathfinder who believed in the sanctity of the ballot as a vehicle for electing leaders at all levels.\n\nThe former Governor recalled that as President of the Senate, Dr Wayas demonstrated competence, character and discipline in running the affairs of the upper legislative chamber and by extension the National Assembly.\n\nHe noted the honest and robust contributions of Dr. Wayas not just to the legislature but in the overall development of the nation.\n\nNnamani added that Dr. Wayas was one of the best and fertile minds that presided over the Nigerian Senate, saying \u201c We have lost a patriot and committed democrat who took the entire country as his constituency\u201d.\n\nHe stated that Dr Wayas believed in a fair and just society where no citizen is impeded or inhibited from pursuing his or her legitimate ambition on account of religion, ethnic or tribal leaning.\n\nNnamani expressed hope that the slogan of one Nigeria, one destiny and brotherhood no matter the differences in tongue which Dr Wayas espoused during his lifetime would be the guiding light for the present and future generation of Nigerians.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am confident that these vehicles of engagement and cooperation will serve our mutual interests.\u201d\n\nBoth presidents, also yesterday, launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue for Peace and Security, Youth Development and Political Participation.\n\nSpeaking to the youth virtually, Buhari said he was optimistic that the initiative would promote peace building and development as well as help both countries to jointly combat youth restiveness.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that the dialogue would enable both countries to strategically develop \u201ca vast world of collaboration in areas of science and technology,\u201d including climate change, energy demands, green technology, artificial intelligence, cyber security, telematics, agriculture, technology and much more.\n\nHe stated, \u201dNigeria and South Africa have a combined population of about 262 million, of which 95 million are youth. This represents tremendous potential for both countries if we can truly harness this demographic with more dedicated action.\n\n\u201cThis sizable youth population may also represent significant problems if we fail to maximise their potential in a world that globalisation and technology are reshaping at breakneck speed.\n\n\u201dThese are the rationale for proposing this Youth Dialogue. Both countries need more educated youth, more skilled youth, more youth in entrepreneurship, more solution providers, and peacekeepers and more patriotic youth.\n\n\u201cIt is true that our youth already collaborate, especially in the creative arts, sharing our rich cultures. We will build upon this, especially in the framework of the intra- African trade expansion we intend to promote through the African Continental Free Trade Agreement.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader said strategic and committed collaborations in science and technology and many other areas would provide both countries with solutions and critical intellectual property to unleash economic outcomes for the creation of millions of jobs.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference after the bilateral talks, Buhari described Ramaphosa\u2019s visit as successful, despite the scare generated by the new Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nHe said, \u201cDespite the scare generated by the new COVID-19 variant, we have been able to hold successful meetings, while observing strict COVID-19 protocols, through fraternal cooperation and understanding.\n\n\u201cI sincerely wish to thank my brother and colleague, President Cyril Ramaphosa, for honouring my invitation. I equally wish to thank members of the South African delegation and the experts that worked tirelessly during the Senior Officials Meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, has witnessed the signing of new Memoranda of Understanding between Nigeria and South Africa in diverse areas, including Youth Development, Women and Child Empowerment and Political Consultations; critical areas that will lead to increased people to people contact.\n\n\u201cAlso, existing MOUs signed during previous Bi-National Commission meetings were also reviewed. These include MOUs on military cooperation, power, cooperation in the fields of geology, mining, and mineral processing, oil and gas and several others.\n\n\u201cToday, we also jointly launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue, another veritable tool for interaction among our youth with the aim of creating shared values and aspiration. Many of our youth from Nigeria and South Africa joined us virtually during the launch.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa described the travel ban imposed on his country and some of its neighbours by some Western countries as discriminatory, arbitrary, and unscientific.\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), and Canada imposed travel bans on South Africa and some Southern African countries following the recent detection of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 by South African scientists.\n\nOmicron has been classed as a \u201cvariance of concern\u201d, as early evidence suggests that it has a higher re-infection risk.\n\nBut Ramaphosa said at the press conference that the decision to impose a ban on travels to and from his country and others would be counterproductive in the long run. He commended Nigeria and other African countries that had decided to express solidarity with South Africa and its neighbours by not shutting their doors against sister African nations over the new COVID-19 strain.\n\nRamaphosa said, \u201cI think it is important that I emphasise this in the light of the discovery by South African scientists of the Omicron variant of the Coronavirus and subsequent imposition of extremely harsh and unfair travel restrictions on flights from and to South Africa as well as on a number of other African countries.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari, the solidarity expressed by yourself and the government of Nigeria sends the strongest message. It says that as African countries, we are standing united against the imposition of arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions that are not only unscientific, but counterproductive in the long run.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the leaders of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, where we are traveling to later today, as well as the leaders of Ghana and Senegal, have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the travel ban against South Africa and our sister countries in Southern Africa.\n\n\u201cThis is a global pandemic. And overcoming it requires that we collaborate and work together as a collective. The resulting damage to this travel ban to the economies of the countries affected will be considerable and long lasting.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to use this opportunity to once again call on the countries who have imposed this ban to reverse their decisions, whether they are in the northern, more developed economies or in other parts of our continent and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the agreements and memoranda signed between his country and Nigeria, Ramaphosa said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a successful 10th session of the Nigeria-South Africa Bi-national Commission. President Buhari and I witnessed the signing of a number of agreements and memoranda of understanding to advance trade and investment, development, economic upliftment, as well as youth empowerment, among others.\n\n\u201cThese new agreements between our two countries broaden the scope of our cooperation on issues of common interest and mutual benefits and we will continue to work together to ensure their implementation. At present, our countries have signed approximately 32 agreements and today we have added other agreements.\n\n\u201cThey are an MOU in the field of youth development and agreement on audio visual cooperation, and a programme of cooperation on arts and culture. The youth development agreement will be key to improving people-to-people relations and capacitating the young people of our two countries in acceding to higher levels of development, as well as progress.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa, Nigeria both have rich cultural, vibrant arts and flourishing sports sectors, all of which will be greatly enriched through greater collaboration through the programme of cooperation between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe agreement on audio visual cooperation will be a boost to the film production industries in our respective countries and we, as South Africa, stands to benefit greatly from cooperation with the world-famous Nollywood that has really emerged very strongly here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Segun James, Emma Okonji\n\nand Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nAttorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), yesterday, justified the government\u2019s White Paper on the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) report on the October 2020 Lekki tollgate incident, saying the government complied with the laws and the weight of evidence presented at the panel to reach a decision.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the Government as stated in the White Paper was not contrary to the panel\u2019s findings, especially, the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, who said only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on during the EndSARS protests, were from Lekki, and out of whom only one had gunshot injury.\n\nOnigbanjo, who spoke during a Morning Show programme on the ARISE News Television, said inconsistencies and contradictions in the leaked reports of the panel that nine people died at the Lekki tollgate made the panel\u2019s finding in respect to deaths at the tollgate unreliable, adding that for a finding that somebody died at a scene to be acceptable, there must be no doubt.\n\n\u201cThe position of Lagos State Government is based on the findings of the panel itself. So, it is not that Lagos State Government just conjured things from the air. We went through the report and what we saw particularly in reference to the death of nine persons is that they found the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. Obafunwa, who conducted an autopsy on all the bodies picked up all over Lagos during the protests, not just at Lekki Tollgate but statewide, credible and there was no evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cProf. Obafunwa said of all the bodies he conducted autopsies on, three came from Lekki and out of the three only one had gunshot injuries. And the panel then said we believe you;we accept your evidence, because there is nothing to the contrary. So, in law, if you put that on the imaginary scale, it means what Prof. Obafunwa said outweighs every other evidence before the panel,\u201d he said.\n\nOnigbanjo further debunked the allegations that the panel made no reference to policemen nor took them into consideration.\n\n\u201cThey (JPI) issued two reports. The report that leaked only dealt with the issues from the Lekki Toll Gate. There is another report, which they issued which was not leaked; that report deals with all the EndSARS petitions that were about 253 in number and of the 253, policemen also brought their own petitions and in that report, the panel awarded a sum of about N36.2million to the policemen, who were affected one way or the other by the protests.\n\n\u201cSo, to be fair to them, they did consider the plights of the policemen too. And even if you look at most of their recommendations, they are for better welfare for the police, better equipment, more training, psychological evaluations. So, they took them into consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attorney-general, however, denied the allegations that Lagos State Government was put under pressure by the federal government to discredit the panel\u2019s report, adding that at no time did the state government encourage personal attacks against any members of the panel.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe federal government never put the Lagos State Government under any pressure to discredit the panel or anybody. If you check the records, nobody from Lagos State Government discredited the panel. In fact, they submitted the report on the 15th of November 2021, the governor praised them and thanked them for the job they did.\n\n\u201cEven yesterday, in his speech, which he made before the White Paper was released, he thanked them again. So, nobody from the Lagos State Government directly or indirectly has sought to discredit members of the panel. We appreciate the job they did for almost 13 months. We do not condone such attacks on anybody.\n\n\u201cI think we have conducted ourselves in such a manner that we strive to always do what is right. We complied with the law; we set up the panel. So, if we didn\u2019t even want the panel, there are so many ways it could have been stopped. They asked for an extension, we gave them. The initial funding was N200million; they exhausted it and asked for more, we gave them.\n\n\u201cWe appointed independent-minded people into the panel. And the panel itself said in its report that they give credit to the Lagos State Government for allowing them to be completely independent. Lagos State Government has fulfilled all its promises to the public. We set up an independent panel, we said we will release a White Paper and we did. We have complied with the law all the way.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Payourse secures $600k pre-seed to accelerate crypto adoption across Africa",
          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernest and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology?

Oui Capital and other angel investors also participated in the round.\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work: Interestingly, Herconomy closed the funding round in just 24 hours. A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics.\n\nAn awareness campaign that the stigma attached to people living with AIDS can be just as deadly as the disease.\n\nIn a press statement by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the world \u201ccould face 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next ten years\u201d if inequalities are not addressed.\n\nToday\u2019s insight on AIDS is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here.\n\nOctamile raises $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctamile Founder, Gbenro Dara\n\nOctamile, an African insurtech startup, has closed a $500,000 pre-seed round to simplify access to insurance for Africans.\n\nThe funding round was led by EchoVC. Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team. Source: TechEconomy\n\nOfferZen, a South African marketplace for tech talents, has announced a \u20ac4.5 million ($5.1 million at the time of writing this) Series A raise by Base Capital.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, this is the startup\u2019s first raise since it was founded by Philip Joubert, Malan Joubert, and Brett Jones in 2015.\n\nAfter operating in South Africa for almost five years, the company expanded into the Netherlands with the acquisition of Amsterdam-based recruitment tech startup, TryCatch.\n\nOfferZen onboards software developers and engineers and makes them available to companies that require their services. Joubert told TechCrunch that over 1,000 companies and 100,000 developers from South Africa, the Netherlands and some parts of Europe use the marketplace.\n\nHowever, its expansion to the Netherlands has been a big part of its growth in 2021, recording a 29% increase in placements.\n\nThis is perhaps why the funding will be used to deepen its expansion into Europe.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nMilitants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt\u2019s Deadliest Terrorist Attack.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most stories, there are almost always two sides of the coin. When it comes to fundraising, for some, it could be as easy as getting funds in two hours, and for others, it could take as much as nine years\n\nThe fundraising journey can be very tedious, and as Bashir Aminu, Payourse CEO, told Techpoint Africa on a call yesterday, it took a while for everything to come together.\n\nToday, Payourse announces a $600,000 pre-seed, which saw participation from Michael Ugwu, Flori Ventures, Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Others include CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg; Kola Aina, Managing Partner, Ventures Platform; Angel Touch Holdings; and Oluwatobi Anisere.\n\nThis is the company\u2019s first real funding round, with the combination of a $100,000 raise from Ugwu in March 2021, another $100,000 from Flori Ventures in July 2021 and an angel investment from Payourse\u2019s co-founder, John Anisere\u2019s brother, Oluwatobi Anisere in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Aminu tells Techpoint Africa that they never actually reached out to investors. Ugwu sent a Direct Message to one of the co-founders on Twitter, Flori Ventures was introduced through a partner and so was Olumide Soyombo, Founder of Volton Capital.\n\nBut the early days of applying to accelerators and getting rejected \u2014 they applied to Y Combinator twice and got rejected both times \u2014 taught them an important lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was getting the meeting with the investors that was the problem. We realised that once we actually get a meeting with an investor and talk to them, they want to invest. The first day we had a call with Michael, he wanted to invest.\u201d The same story with Flori Ventures, Aminu says.\n\nThe journey into entrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Aminu, Anisere, and Hakeem Orewole co-founded Payourse, launching the company\u2019s first product, Coinprofile.\n\nAminu had dropped out of a five-year programme in the Federal University of Technology, Minna in 2017, but had caught the crypto bug before then.\n\n\u201cI found out about crypto from a friend and then I bought some and since then I became obsessed. Because it was interesting to me and I was someone who was really curious back in school, and II didn\u2019t really understand how it could be money and wanted to understand it. I kind of went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand how bitcoin and crypto works.\u201d\n\nThat same year, he met Orewole on an online crypto forum and the two became good friends. So good that both founded a crypto startup in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, it failed because, as Aminu laughingly says, \u201cI was very young then and didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d They went on to found another startup in 2018, but this one \u201cfailed even faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, Aminu decided the startup life was not for him and decided to take his chances in the labour market.\n\nDuring his undergraduate days, he had learnt graphic design and soon got a job with an Australian company where he learnt a little bit of product designing while in his role as a graphic designer.\n\nHe moved to Busha \u2014 where he met Anisere \u2014 and then to TeamApt, Yellow Card, Interswitch, and finally Binance.\n\nWhat is a Payourse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayourse\u2019s homepage\n\nOn Monday, November 22, 2021, Aminu announced on Twitter a new parent company, Payourse.\n\nToday, I'm excited to introduce our new parent brand.\n\n\n\nMeet Payourse @payourse. We're passionate about accelerating access to crypto for Africans by providing tools that make it easier, faster and cheaper for businesses to build user-friendly crypto products like @coinpHQ. \u2014 Bash \u6211\u521b\u9020 \u272a (@scozky) November 22, 2021\n\nBut as he tells Techpoint during our call, Payourse has been in existence since 2019, when they first founded Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cWell, we actually created Payourse, a long time ago, in 2019 as a parent company, but we never really announced it to the world. But it\u2019s always been the parent company. And we\u2019ve always had this long term vision of a company which would build user-friendly products on top of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to make crypto accessible to everyone, as Aminu strongly believes it is the future of finance in Africa.\n\nAfrica is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally with six countries \u2014 Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania \u2014 making it into the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20.\n\nThe Web3 \u2014 a decentralised version of the Internet built on public blockchains \u2014 craze has also been making waves, with increasing noise being made in crypto and blockchain spaces.\n\nHowever, apart from creating accessible products is the vision to be the crypto powerhouse, a go-to for any organisation looking to build or integrate Web3 or crypto products.\n\nPayourse currently has two major products, Coinprofile and Simpa.\n\nThe first iteration of Coinprofile was a Disha but for crypto wallets.\n\n\u201cI used to be an OTC (over-the-counter) trader, so anytime someone wants to send me crypto, and I always have to go to my wallet address and copy wallet address and send it to them. It was a very tedious process.\u201d\n\nFrom experience, he knew that other traders faced the same issues, so the idea was for people to create an account and store all their wallet addresses, and a unique link is created, leading to a landing page. This was where the name coinprofile came from. It doesn\u2019t require sign-ups, and there are no transaction charges.\n\nThe current remittance product came in May. Now, users can send cryptocurrency to anyone and receive it in cash in their bank accounts.\n\nThen there\u2019s Simpa, a no-code tool that enables businesses to create their own crypto exchange.\n\nThe numbers and the challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith free transfers, how does Payourse make money? Well, Aminu tells Techpoint that they earn an average of 1.5 \u2013 2% and sometimes even as much as 10% per transaction.\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile, with millions of dollars processed on the platform. Since its launch, the exchange has grown 15,000% across all touchpoints and maintained a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nAminu says Simpa is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version and is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks.\n\nBut building a company always comes with its challenges. And two of the biggest have been talent and marketing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced challenges in hiring. In fact, we\u2019ve had to let go of two of our employees. We had to hire them at that point because we hadn\u2019t raised a lot of funding, and we couldn\u2019t get a lot of really good people to apply for our roles.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they\u2019ve had to settle for junior to mid-level developers, with most senior developers opting to work for international companies.\n\nWith a team of eight and three technical founders, they\u2019ve had to rely on word of mouth and judging by their numbers, they might not be doing too badly, but Aminu tells us that an essential hire in the wake of this raise is hiring a Growth or Marketing person.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from hiring, Aminu outlines two critical things this fund would be used for: building out current products to package them for sales and making existing use cases better.\n\nIn a round that was oversubscribed up to $2 million, Aminu says there\u2019s no rush to get more funding.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe Payourse will be the powerhouse of crypto in Africa. When a business wants to develop crypto products for the African market or wants to integrate crypto into what they already have, we are the go-to.\n\n\u201cOur plan is not just to build infrastructure, but also build use cases around the infrastructure. We already have Coinprofile and Simpa. It might take a while, but we are not honestly looking to raise a $100 million very quickly. We want to, first of all, have a business and a clear path to revenue. The funding will come.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are determined to make Edo a healthcare hub in Nigeria. The healthcare system is really about the people. Infrastructure is important. If you don\u2019t have the people that are properly trained, then the equipment will just be fancy for tourism. Within the Edo axis, we can muster up to five thousand doctors in different specialisations.\n\n\u201cIf we have access to people who can provide quality healthcare and have world-class institutions or facilities to provide that training, then we should do it. Having the right governance means an arrangement where people don\u2019t need to travel to get the kind of care they need.\n\n\u201cWe are very keen and are anxious to get this started. For us as a state, we just try and execute. Hopefully, next week, we will establish a joint account and the procurement process has to be accelerated; within the next four to six weeks, let the orders be placed.\n\n\u201cI want to thank and appreciate you and the people of Edo will eternally be grateful. We can now proudly say that you have one of your largest investments in Africa in Edo and this is what they are contributing to the lives of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative, Dr. Ubon Udoh, commended the governor for impacting the lives of Edo people through healthcare, noting, \u201cIt is a clear indication of your vision for your state and commitment in bettering the lives of your people, through health care.

          "title": "Enabling Dreams with First Bank \u2018December is a Vybe\u2019",
          "text": "One of the most fascinating quotes of popular British business magnate and author, Sir Richard Brandson is that \u201cA great business is simply an idea to make other people\u2019s lives better.\u201d This vital nugget aligns with a global view that a critical element of successful brands is the ability to beyond functional products benefits become a visible partner in customers lives, enabling them live better and happier, aim higher and achieve their dreams.\n\nFor businesses, this means seeing beyond financial gains into becoming a true ally and partner who make life worth living. This is a core hallmark of the few enduring global brands and First Bank appears focused on towing the path.\n\nBeyond business promotion and marketing engagements solely for commercial value, the premier bank in its 127th year is assisting Nigerians to live happier and create awesome memories of good time with cherished ones through some cool initiatives.\n\nGlobally, December heralds the holiday season during which people love to celebrate, unwind and relax with loved ones. Though checkered by Covid-19 disruptions in 2020, FirstBank is giving a new expression and meaning to \u2018December in Nigeria\u2019 with the high-octane and life enriching #FirstBankIssaVybe, #DecemberIssaVybe campaign.\n\nThe campaign which started in 2018 is already generating ripples across the cities with Nigerians across ages anticipating the new trick FirstBank will pull out from the hat this year.\n\nThrough the annual FirstBankIssaVybe campaign, FirstBank sponsors of an array of the hottest and coolest entertainment platforms across music, fashion and arts during the month of December, with massive ticket giveaways to premium events.\n\nThe goal is to create enthralling and memorable experience for customers in the Yuletide season as they bond with family and friends, whilst connecting with their favourite superstars.\n\nCommenting with much enthusiasm on the year-end campaign, global head marketing and corporate communication of FirstBank, Folake Ani-Mumuney says it\u2019s simply FirstBank creating a \u2018Wow December to Remember\u2019 experience for all as a bank for all generations.\n\nFor her, #FirstBankIssaVybe offers a variety performance; FirstBank is not just considering financial well-being but also the entire well-being for customers. That is why it is enabling opportunities for families to come together to celebrate and enjoy premium concerts, plays, fashion and food, and gave out over 500 mostly VIP tickets per campaign, which cost from N15,000 to N50,000.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted with our achievements and consider the yuletide a good way of identifying with our customers and appreciating their support. We want them to have the best of fun through this period. Through different expressions, we strive to support our heritage; the value systems we believe in and create opportunities for families to bond across generations.\n\n\u201cThe carefully curated experiences speak to our ethos, what we believe in and what Nigerians would appreciate. We do not just concentrate like some other brands on specific areas, or just one name; we are true enablers across the raft, and offered variety. We also use the opportunity to further deepen support for arts and job creation.\n\n\u201cWe also spread the program across the nation with sponsorship of Igue Festival in Edo State, and Calabar Carnival in Cross River State.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe group chairman of Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc., Dr Akin Ogunbiyi has been described as a worthy ambassador of Obafemi Awolowo University and will on Saturday be honoured with Distinguished Great Ife Alumnus Award by the University.\n\nThis was conveyed in a letter signed by the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Eyitayo O. Ogunbodede.\n\nThe VC remarked that the award of excellence was in recognition of Dr Akin Ogunbiyi\u2019s support and dedication to the growth of the University. He stressed that Dr Ogunbiyi is a \u201cpassionate, supportive and dedicated Great Ife Ambassador\u201d.\n\nThe awardee graduated from the University of Ife, now OAU, in 1986 with a Second-Class Upper Degree. The class of the degree is a testimony that he has always been focused and understood what to do even as a young man. He also earned himself Honorary PhD. in Insurance and Risk Management because of his hard work, passion for knowledge, strategic business management skills and great human relations.\n\nHe obtained a master\u2019s degree from the University of Navarra, Spain. He is a graduate of Yale School of Management, Harvard Business School, Advanced Management from the University of Oxford and many more. His quest for knowledge distinguishes him and makes it easy for him to be able to relate with every man and woman in different spheres of life including in business.\n\nDr Akin Ogunbiyi became Managing Director of a company four years after leaving University. He went from there to begin the path of building many business conglomerates including Mutual Benefits Assurance Group that now employs thousands of Nigerians and is contributing to the economic development of the Nation. At present, the business is worth billions of naira today.\n\nFor Dr Ogunbiyi, it takes not just knowledge to build business but charisma and the ability to manage resources of which human capital is the bedrock. He relates well with both old and young. His respect and empathy for humans is more than a gift but borne out of his humble background himself. He was born and raised in Ile-Ogbo, Osun State.\n\nYou can understand why it is very easy for him to set up a foundation that supports many students with scholarships. This and many more reasons is why it is not surprising when OAU decided to confer on him the Distinguished Great Ife Alumnus Award in recognition of his contributions to Nations building.\n\nIt should also be noted that what makes the USA, China and Europe great and different is because of industrial revolutions and the ability to empower their citizens. The leaders of these developed countries are great minds, selfless, knowledgeable, strategic, charismatic and these are the qualities inherent in Dr Akin Ogunbiyi.\n\nFurthermore, the likes of Dr Ogunbiyi understand that quality education and training are vital to creating a successful business. They understand that our schools and the whole education system need proper attention so we can have employable graduates that can help sustain the economy. Great minds and successful businessmen and women understand that there has to be a security of lives and properties as these will affect their business and investment.\n\nThis is why Dr Akin Ogunbiyi wants to lend himself to the service of Osun State. This is what Dr Ogunbiyi will do if elected as Governor of Osun State come 2022. The fact that governance is a serious business is underscored why Governors are also referred to as Chief Executive Officers. We need experienced great minds like Dr. Ogunbiyi to wake up the crumbling economy of Osun so that an end will come to borrowing for unjust cause or not being able to meet up with the social responsibility as a state.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday rescheduled the trial of the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from January 19 to 18, 2022.\n\nThe shift in the trial date followed the abridgement of time granted by the Judge following a passionate plea to that effect.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor had approached the Court with an application seeking an order of the Court to accommodate the trial in November and December this year as against the earlier January 19, 2022.\n\nThe prosecuting Attorney of the Federal Government, Shuaib Labaran, however, told the Court that a counter affidavit opposing the request by the government has been filled and served on Kanu.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Binta Nyako however informed Kanu\u2019s lawyer that the application for time abridgement cannot be granted because there was no judicial time for such an issue.\n\nDuring the drama that ensued, the case diary of the Court was read to the lawyer to establish that the Court has crowded pending cases, Punch reported.\n\nFollowing the insistence, Justice Nyako agreed to shift other cases slated for January 18 to accommodate the trial which would last till January 19 and 20.\n\nMeanwhile Justice Nyako ordered the Department of State Services to allow Kanu to practice his faith, change his clothes and be given the maximum possible comfort in the detention facility.\n\nBarrister Aloy Ejimakor, a Special Counsel to Kanu, disclosed this while giving an insight into what transpired during hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Ejimakor the court stated, \u201cThat Mazi Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility. That he be allowed a change of clothing.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by the lawyer, he noted that during the hearing, there was a total absence of security operatives in court and around the outer perimeters as was the case during previous proceedings.\n\nAlso, Ejimakor stated that Mazi Kanu was not in court and there was no officer from the Department of State Service to explain why. However, from what he surmised, both the court and the DSS might have concluded that his presence in court was not strictly required in the sort of application that was moved in court today.\n\nThe lawyer also claimed that the court did not grant Kanu\u2019s legal team the leave to move their application challenging the jurisdiction of the court to continue the trial.\n\nThe statement further read, \u201cRecall that we had filed such application, arguing that the extraordinary rendition of Kanu constitutes a constitutional barrier to his trial. The court ruled that the application was not calendared for hearing today. That it will be heard at the next adjourned date.\n\n\u201cThe court, after going through what it said is a tight judicial calendar, moved the date of the next hearing backwards from 19th to 18th January 2022. The court ruled that it will entertain all outstanding applications at the next hearing date, and proceeded to make the following Orders: That Mazi Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility. That he be allowed a change of clothing.\u201d\n\nMore so, the lawyer noted that the court gave the IPOB leader the nod to practice his Jewish faith.\n\nEjimakor further noted, \u201cThat he be allowed free practice of his Jewish faith including access to his Jewish religious materials. That the DSS obey all previous orders granted in the matter, including allowing Kanu any visitor of his choice. That Kanu be permitted, at his option, to mingle freely with other inmates or any other persons at the detention facility.\u201d",

Bello Tongo, while delivering his speech, stressed the need for entrepreneurial education in schools, for sustainable socio-economic development in the country.\n\nHe said that the need to support education in the North-East region becomes imperative because the region has been the hardest hit in Nigeria, with high levels of insecurity and poverty, saying that the North-East also has the highest illiteracy rate in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the lowest rates being 31.9 per cent for males, and 14.9 per cent for females both recorded in Yobe State in the North-East, have female primary net attendance rate of 47.7per cent.\n\n\u201cThe education deprivation in Northern Nigeria is driven by various factors, including economic barriers and socio-cultural norms and practices that discourage attendance informal education, especially for girls.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the North-East Literacy Festival marks an important first step in reinvigorating the literacy levels in the region.

On the issue of Boko Haram insurgency, in August 2021, the Nigerian Army recorded millstones in the fight against local terrorism, with at least 186 members of Islamic State In West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram surrendering to the Nigerian troops.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this unprecedented mass surrender of the terrorists, security incidents in the operating areas of the North East have significantly dwindled.\n\n\u201cAlthough there have been increased security incidents in the South east states of Nigeria, the region remains stable. These security occurrences are largely as a result of the activities of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group and criminal elements, whose operations wreaked havoc in the region.\n\n\u201cThe region has recorded over 200% increase in killings and violent attacks on civilian and government forces since the capture of IPOB leader in June 2021. The leader of the group is currently in custody and being charged for treason,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report also noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced security incidents from the herder-farmer clashes, adding that this positive outcome was reportedly attributed to the anti-open grazing ban that was declared by Governors in the southern states of the country earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cIn September 2021 the South- South state of Bayelsa confirmed that the enforcement of the anti-open grazing law has effectively restored calmness in the state and has reduced the constant frictions between the herders and other residents in the state,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe delegation, however, noted that more needed to be done to completely end the menace of terrorism and insurgency in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe delegation also assured the parliament that Nigeria has made tremendous efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the COVID-19 with available vaccines, which it said has achieved about 98% utilization of the 4 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, Nigeria is making concerted efforts to reach \u2018herd immunity\u2019 levels.

          "text": "In furtherance of its contribution to reducing the harmful effects of industrial wastes on the environment, the management of APM Terminals Apapa, has started using recycled tyres in pavement blocks for exterior flooring.\n\nStudies have shown that recycling of tyres helps reduce the effects of harmful chemicals on the environment. Recycling also prevents tyres from becoming breeding grounds for disease-carrying pests like malaria mosquitoes.\n\nThe Terminal Manager of APM Terminals Apapa, Steen Knudsen, said that the company is running a trial with a recycling firm named Freetown Waste Management Recycle Limited to use pavement blocks made of recycled tyres, and potentially recycle own used tyres with them in the future. After the trial, sustainability of the solution will be evaluated.\n\n\u201cWith all the rolling equipment that we have, we are consuming a lot of tyres on an annual basis. We are at the moment running a trial where we use recycled compressed tyres turned into pavement blocks for paving different areas of the terminal where we have pedestrian traffic.\n\nIt is quite an interesting project and the trial is in collaboration with a recycling facility located in Nigeria, Freetown Waste Management Recycle Limited, where we might send our own used tyres to in the future and get them back as pavement blocks, which we then use.

          "text": "On Thursday, Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja issued a severe warning to Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the counsel for Nnamdi Kanu, the incarcerated leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to avoid writing letters directly to her about his client\u2019s trial.\n\nThe Judge objected that the lawyer had written two lengthy letters to her personally, rather than going through the Registrar of the court, as is customary.\n\nWhile making her views clear in open court, Justice Nyako stated that a repeat of the breach of procedure to reach court on such an issue will not be tolerated.\n\nDespite the Judge\u2019s admonition, the lawyer attempted to move two motions on notice on behalf of his client.\n\nKanu\u2019s counsel has filed an application on notice with the court, requesting a shortening of time to move the Biafran leader\u2019s trial from January 19 next year to a later date in November or December.\n\nThe Biafran leader, however, was not present in court to observe proceedings because he was not brought by the Department of State Service DSS, where he has been on remand since his re-arrest by the federal government after jumping bail previously granted.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s attorney, Mr Shuaib Labaran, informed the Judge that his client had filed a counter-affidavit vigorously opposing the request to abridge time in the trial, which had been scheduled for January of next year.\n\nJustice Nyako, who was caught aback by the motion\u2019s motivation, told Kanu\u2019s lawyer that her court did not have the judicial authority to move the trial date backwards.\n\nThe case diary of the court was read to the lawyer in the ensuing drama to prove that the court has a backlog of cases to deal with.\n\nHowever, in response to Kanu\u2019s continuous petition, Justice Nyako consented to reschedule other cases scheduled for January 18 to make room for Kanu\u2019s trial, which would take place on January 19 and 20.\n\nIn another twist, Ejiofor attempted to move Kanu\u2019s motion to challenge the competency of the federal government\u2019s 7-count treasonable criminal accusations against him.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s counsel objected, claiming that the motion was not ready for hearing and that the only business scheduled for the day was the request for abridgement of time.\n\nJustice Nyako concurred with the government lawyer and dismissed the motion\u2019s request.\n\nHowever, after another appeal by Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Justice Nyako ordered DSS to enable Kanu to practice his faith, change his clothes, and be given the most comfortable detention facility feasible.",

He is not a criminal\u201d, and \u201cAgricultural revolution and safety for farmers now\u201d.\n\nIgboho and his wife were captured by security personnel in Cotonou, Benin Republic, on July 19 after fleeing Nigeria to avoid arrest by Nigeria\u2019s secret police, the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nThe DSS had designated Igboho sought after its operatives carried out a deadly raid on his home in Ibadan\u2019s Soka neighborhood, killing two persons and capturing 12 aides, but Igboho managed to flee.\n\nBefore being arrested in Benin Republic while attempting to fly to Germany, DSS Public Relations Officer Peter Afunnaya asked Igboho to give himself in.\n\nIgboho\u2019s wife, on the other hand, has been released from police custody, while he remains detained in the West African country.\n\nIgboho\u2019s release has been increasingly demanded recently.\n\nToyin Dawodu, a Nigerian-American philanthropist, has urged the Benin Republic authorities to free Igboho immediately.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, Dawodu warned that the Beninese government must assure the activist\u2019s proper release within seven days or face \u201csevere consequences of the nature of an economic embargo from which the country may never recover in a very long time.\u201d\n\nThe donor predicted that the continued detention of Igboho, a beloved Yoruba figure, will enrage the people who had contributed 80 percent of the country\u2019s money over the last 60 years.\n\nHe claims that this will harm the neighboring West African country\u2019s economy.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lawyer, Yomi Alliyu, requested with the government of Benin Republic a few weeks ago to release the activist quickly so that he may receive urgent medical treatment abroad.\n\nIgboho\u2019s spokeswoman, Olayomi Koiki, also stated that his principal required immediate medical attention.",

I equally wish to thank members of the South African delegation and the experts that worked tirelessly during the Senior Officials Meeting.\n\n\u201dToday, has witnessed the signing of new Memoranda of Understanding between Nigeria and South Africa in diverse areas including Youth Development, Women and Child Empowerment and Political Consultations; critical areas that will lead to increased people to people contact.\n\n\u201dAlso, existing MOUs signed during previous Bi-National Commission meetings were also reviewed. These include MOUs on Military Cooperation, Power, Cooperation in the field of Geology, Mining, and Mineral Processing, Oil and Gas and several others.\n\n\u201dToday, we also jointly launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue, another veritable tool for interaction among our youth with the aim of creating shared values and aspiration. Many of our youth, from Nigeria and South Africa joined us virtually during the launch,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked his colleague for initiating the Youth Dialogue, noting that continuous interaction between the youth of the two countries would further break barriers and suspicion among our people.\n\nHe added that the inauguration of the Joint Ministerial Advisory Council on Industry, Trade and Investment, would enable the private sectors of the two largest economies in Africa to further promote economic cooperation and development.\n\n\u201dWe appreciate that we need to do much more to achieve further integration of our two economies and take full advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\n\u201dOnce again, I wish to thank my brother President and members of the South African delegation for their visit and their wonderful friendship, cooperation and solidarity,\u201d he said.\n\nRamaphosa\n\nIn his remarks, President Ramaphosa thanked the leaders of Nigeria, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal for expressing their dissatisfaction with the travel ban imposed on South Africa and sister neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant by South African scientists.\n\nHe described the imposition of the ban by some western countries as arbitrary, discriminatory, unscientific and unproductive in the long run.\n\n\u201dThis is a global pandemic and overcoming it requires that we collaborate and work together as a collective.\n\n\u201dThe resulting damage to this travel ban to the economies of the countries affected will be considerable and long lasting.\n\n\u201dSo I want to use this opportunity to tell the countries that have imposed this ban to reverse their decisions whether they are the northern more developed economies or in other parts of our continent or elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n3 Omicron variant, 105 COVID-19 cases\n\nMeanwhile, The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Wednesday announced fresh 105 COVID-19 infections just as Nigeria joined the growing list of countries that have recorded the new Omicron variant with the detection of 3 cases in the country.\n\nThe agency stated this in its daily report in Abuja.\n\nThe 105 additional cases, NCDC said, is an increase from the 21 cases reported in the country the previous day, warning that Nigeria was at the risk of registering high incidences of the new variant due to neglect of preventive measures at airports and other points of entry in the country.\n\nThe latest additional cases which were recorded in 8 states and the FCT, showed the country now had a total of 214,218 COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\nIt listed the states that recorded the new COVID-19 cases to include Lagos (43), Gombe (21), FCT (16), Niger (10), Rivers (6), Plateau (5), Edo (2), Bauchi (1), and Kano (1).\n\nThe NCDC said 12 people had recovered from the infection as at Tuesday, while the total number of discharged cases now stood at 207,304 nationwide.",

          "text": "\u2026Says challenges undermining national unity can no longer be ignored\n\nThe immediate past chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, has called on elected leaders at all levels to address the smouldering crisis arising from regional agitations across Nigeria to safeguard the unity of the country.\n\nHe specifically enjoined the leaders to consciously promote and uphold the rule of law in order to engender peace and harmony.\n\nAccording to him, national unity in a diverse country like Nigeria is not easy to attain due to what he called \u201cethno-linguistic differences, social and religious identities, which ordinarily foster and bolster prejudice and obstinacy, which are susceptible to mobilisation and manipulation by ethno-religious elite.\u201d\n\nProfessor Jega spoke in a keynote address at the National Unity Summit 2021, entitled Nigeria: \u201cThe Imperative of Unity\u201d organised by the National Prosperity Movement (NPM) Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThe former INEC boss said the tensions that sparked off agitations across the country were linked to crises of inequality, marginalisation and outright denial of citizens\u2019 rights to harmonious co-existence among others.\n\nHe also fingered at \u201cincompetent and parochial leaders\u201d for the surge of regional and sectional violence and security challenges across the country, saying \u201cnational unity has to be deliberately forged, nurtured and entrenched through citizenship mobilization, sensitisation and education, as well as through policies and programmes for actualising the goal of unity in diversity and national integration.\u201d\n\nThe former university vice chancellor highlighted the major threats to national unity to include; negative mobilisation of ethno-religious and other primordial identities, especially in contestations for power in electoral politics, hate speeches targeted at perceived \u2018others\u2019, in an \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 categorisations, reckless peddling of misinformation, giving primacy to \u2018indigenes\u2019 over \u2018citizenship\u2019 rights in state and local governance, Boko Haram insurgency, and irredentist militancy in the South-east and South-south among others.\n\n\u201cThere is in present day Nigeria evidence of remarkable erosion of national unity and seeming whittling down if not abandonment of yester-years lofty projects of national integration. The resurgence of, and violent activism by, insurgents and irredentist militants with a clear agenda for dismemberment of Nigeria, is indicative of the sorry state of national unity.\n\n\u201cSo is the increasingly indifferent and apathetic disposition of teeming youth with regards to serious national affairs, which ordinarily would require their active engagement. Indeed, many young men and women are frustrated that they are diverting their energies to aggressive behaviour and creativity to all sorts of criminality. Some have even given up on Nigeria and are merely looking for opportunities to \u2018check-out\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis situation needs to be effectively and decisively addressed. The imperative of national unity is of such importance that the challenges undermining it can no longer be ignored, and all hands need to, have to, be on deck to find lasting solutions to them.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Director General of the National Prosperity Movement, Ahmad Sajoh said NPM\u2019s conviction for organising the summit was predicated on the belief that, as a society, Nigerians were greater than the challenges confronting them.\n\nThose who graced the summit included Ekiti state Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi and General IBM Haruna, who was chairman of the occasion, among several others.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "The Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) on Wednesday announced the immediate suspension of all tournaments in China due to concerns about the well-being of former doubles world number one Peng Shuai and the safety of other players.\n\n\u2018SERIOUS DOUBTS\u2019\n\nPeng did appear in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children\u2019s tennis tournament in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament\u2019s organisers showed.\n\nOn Nov. 21, IOC President Thomas Bach had a 30-minute video call with Peng, who competed at three Olympics, during which she told him she was safe.\n\nBut Simon, who said the decision to suspend tournaments in China had the full support of the WTA Board of Directors, said they were not convinced all was well with Peng.\n\n\u201cWhile we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe, and not subject to censorship, coercion, and intimidation,\u201d said Simon.\n\n\u201cThe WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation \u2013 without censorship \u2013 into Peng Shuai\u2019s sexual assault accusation.\u201d\n\nSimon said the Peng situation demanded a response.\n\n\u201cIf powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded \u2013 equality for women \u2013 would suffer an immense setback. I will not and cannot let that happen,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY\u2019\n\nTennis great and founder of the WTA Billie Jean King was among those who applauded the announcement. read more\n\n\u201cThe WTA has chosen to be on the right side of history in defending the rights of our players,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another reason why women\u2019s tennis is the leader in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\nMartina Navratilova also signalled her support on Twitter, suggesting the IOC \u201ctake note\u201d.\n\nMen\u2019s world number one Novak Djokovic, who recently co-founded a players\u2019 union aiming to represent both male and female professionals, also backed the move.\n\n\u201cI support fully WTA\u2019s stance because we don\u2019t have enough information about Shuai Peng and her well-being,\u201d the Serbian said after a Davis Cup tie in Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life of a tennis player that is in question here, so we, as the tennis community, need to stand together.\u201d\n\nThe United States Tennis Association commended the WTA.\n\n\u201cThis type of leadership is courageous and what is needed to ensure the rights of all individuals are protected and all voices are heard,\u201d the body said in a statement.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) and men\u2019s Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to Cuba, Ma Hui, responded on Twitter with a single word.\n\n\u201cPosturing?\u201d he wrote.\n\nAGGRESSIVE EXPANSION\n\nSimon had previously said the WTA would shut down its operations in China if it was not satisfied with the response to the allegations.\n\nThe WTA began an aggressive expansion into China on the eve of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and local interest in the sport was fuelled by Li Na winning the 2011 French Open.\n\nChina hosted just two WTA events in 2008 but 11 years later was staging nine, including the WTA Tour finals which were secured in a 10-year deal by the city of Shenzhen in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, the WTA announced a 10-year digital rights deal with Chinese streaming platform iQiyi reportedly worth $120 million.\n\nThe pandemic forced the cancellation of all but one of the WTA events in China in 2020 and 2021, including this year\u2019s Tour Finals which were moved to Mexico.\n\nThe 2022 tour calendar has not yet been published.\n\n\u201cUnless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China,\u201d Simon said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s leaders have left the WTA with no choice. I remain hopeful that our pleas will be heard and the Chinese authorities will take steps to legitimately address this issue.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-headquartered tour\u2019s decision to walk away from one of its biggest markets was applauded by many leading figures in the tennis world but could cost the WTA hundreds of millions of dollars in broadcasting and sponsorship revenue.\n\nPeng\u2019s whereabouts became a matter of international concern following a nearly three-week public absence after she posted a message on social media in early November, alleging that China\u2019s former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.\n\nNeither Zhang, who retired in 2018, nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng\u2019s allegation and the topic has been blocked from direct discussion on China\u2019s heavily censored internet. read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how I can ask our athletes to compete there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely and has seemingly been pressured to contradict her allegation of sexual assault,\u201d WTA chief executive Steve Simon said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGiven the current state of affairs, I am also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and calls to the organisers of the China Open tournament went unanswered.\n\nThe ministry said late last month that \u201ccertain people\u201d should stop the \u201cmalicious hyping\u201d and \u201cpoliticization\u201d of the Peng issue. read more\n\nThe decision comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics over China\u2019s human rights record.\n\n\u2018SERIOUS DOUBTS\u2019\n\nPeng did appear in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children\u2019s tennis tournament in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament\u2019s organisers showed.\n\nOn Nov. 21, IOC President Thomas Bach had a 30-minute video call with Peng, who competed at three Olympics, during which she told him she was safe.\n\nBut Simon, who said the decision to suspend tournaments in China had the full support of the WTA Board of Directors, said they were not convinced all was well with Peng.\n\n\u201cWhile we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe, and not subject to censorship, coercion, and intimidation,\u201d said Simon.\n\n\u201cThe WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation \u2013 without censorship \u2013 into Peng Shuai\u2019s sexual assault accusation.\u201d\n\nSimon said the Peng situation demanded a response.\n\n\u201cIf powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded \u2013 equality for women \u2013 would suffer an immense setback.

          "title": "Omicron: Nigeria to Push for Mass Vaccination, Not Travel Ban \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "As countries around the world try to figure out ways to deal with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said it will not join countries imposing travel ban on some nations and regions. NCDC said, instead, it would encourage more Nigerians to get vaccinated, while enhancing surveillance and vigilance.\n\nDirector-General of the centre, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, disclosed this on Wednesday on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d.\n\nAdetifa confirmed that the country now had cases of the new virus strain.\n\nIn a related development, NCDC said it had begun contact tracing on three persons who tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nHe explained that regardless of his recommendations from a technical perspective, a ban was not on the cards for the NCDC.\n\nAdetifa, however said surveillance would be an on-going activity, as the agency continued to generate results from the laboratory, tests, case identification, and sequencing, which will be on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are currently the subject of travel bans ourselves for reasons that are not driven by science. From the perspective of NCDC, we give technical advice, and this is based on risk assessments of transmission from countries where intending travellers are coming from.\n\n\u201cSo, as recommended, if you follow science-driven process, you review the epidemiological situation in those countries, you review the genomic and surveillance data in those countries and then you make a decision based on the risk of importation and the risk of transmission.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that it would not be surprising if more cases were discovered as they continued to sequence the samples, saying this is reflective of the situation worldwide.\n\nOn measures taken so far by the federal government to curtail the spread of the new variant, Adetifa noted that surveillance was in top gear.\n\nHe said, \u201cCountries are required to conduct a risk based assessment of transmission and we are enhancing surveillance in terms of looking at travellers, and ensuring that travellers adhere to all of the travel advisory regarding Day 2 testing and Day 7 testing for the appropriate category. In addition we are prioritising and sequencing, as recommended, for all incoming travellers.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cThe treatment centres across the country are still there, oxygen plants, oxygen supply, to take care of any potential increase in case numbers requiring hospitalisation. We\u2019ve not recorded any fatalities. That there\u2019s a new variant does not really change what we do\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the effectiveness of the public health measures. As recommended, it doesn\u2019t change the requirement for vaccination or the benefits that are likely to accrue for vaccination, regardless of what the variant goes over.\u201d\n\nAdetifa encouraged Nigerians to get vaccinated, explaining that vaccines prevent transmission, reduces transmission if infections should occur and also protect severe disease and death.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the last Peace and Security Council (PSC) press conference, I highlighted how almost all of the deaths in the last two months under review occurred in people who are unvaccinated. So vaccines have the benefits and I hope that with partners in the media, with civil society organisations and everybody else, we will continue to sensitise our fellow citizens to really make use of every opportunity that they have to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the NCDC data collection, he explained that collation was done in the interest of transparency, stressing, \u201cWhat we have seen, again, in the past weeks, obviously, as part of a feature of pandemic fatigue and similar to what\u2019s been reported everywhere else is that there\u2019s been a drop in testing for a few weeks before the last one. But we have seen an uptick in testing as a result of all of the efforts put in place to try and get states and people who are at the frontline to return to testing.\n\n\u201cIt has also gone up in response to our interventions and continued rollouts of rapid diagnostic tests to make this test more accessible, more readily available and easier to do than the reference test, which is PCR. We will continue to do that over the coming weeks. In fact, we are in the process of consolidating testing guidelines, we are preparing for a massive rollout of rapid diagnostic tests as a means of shoring up and ensuring completeness of surveillance.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NCDC, in a statement, explained that the move to carry out contact tracing followed the confirmation of the first positive case of the new COVID-19 variant by the agency yesterday morning. It said the possibility of more cases being detected in the country could not be ruled out since Omicron variant was now widespread globally, given the increasing number of countries reporting the variant.\n\nIt stated that it had activated its contact tracing mechanism by undertaking a follow up to ensure isolation, and linkage to clinical care for the affected persons.\n\nNCDC stated, \u201cContact tracing and other relevant response activities had commenced.\u201d\n\nThe centre noted that arrangements were also being made to notify the country where the traveller originated from, according to the provisions of the International Health Regulations.\n\nNCDC said samples of three persons with history of travel to South Africa were confirmed positive.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cIn line with the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC through its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja, Nigeria confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, also known as the B.1.1.529 lineage.\n\n\u201cThis genomic surveillance has now identified and confirmed Nigeria\u2019s first cases of the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, now known as the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cSamples obtained for the stipulated Day Two test for all travellers to Nigeria were positive for this variant in three persons with history of travel to South Africa. These cases were recent arrivals in the country in the past week.\u201d\n\nNCDC further stated that it was conducting sequencing of all blood samples of SARS-COV-2 positive travellers from all countries, especially countries that had reported the Omicron variant.\n\nThe NCDC statement said, \u201cSince reports of the emergence of this Omicron variant, the Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC, has intensified public health response measures to COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe national travel advisory has also been revised by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and now requires all inbound travellers to Nigeria present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cPre-booking and payment for all Day 2 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests are prerequisites for travel. In addition, all outbound passengers, regardless of the requirements of destination countries, are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country as we combat the pandemic and these emerging variants, including the Delta variant.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja,\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "White Paper Complied with Law on #EndSARS Report, Says Lagos AG",
          "text": "Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), yesterday, justified the government\u2019s White Paper on the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) report on the October 2020 Lekki tollgate incident, saying the government complied with the laws and the weight of evidence presented at the panel to reach a decision.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the Government as stated in the White Paper was not contrary to the panel\u2019s findings, especially, the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, who said only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on during the EndSARS protests, were from Lekki, and out of whom only one had gunshot injury.\n\nOnigbanjo, who spoke during a Morning Show programme on the ARISE News on Wednesday, said inconsistencies and contradictions in the leaked reports of the panel that nine people died at the Lekki tollgate made the panel\u2019s finding in respect to deaths at the tollgate unreliable, adding that for a finding that somebody died at a scene to be acceptable, there must be no doubt.\n\n\u201cThe position of Lagos State Government is based on the findings of the panel itself. So, it is not that Lagos State Government just conjured things from the air. We went through the report and what we saw particularly in reference to the death of nine persons is that they found the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. Obafunwa, who conducted an autopsy on all the bodies picked up all over Lagos during the protests, not just at Lekki Tollgate but statewide, credible and there was no evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cProf. Obafunwa said of all the bodies he conducted autopsies on, three came from Lekki and out of the three only one had gunshot injuries. And the panel then said we believe you;we accept your evidence, because there is nothing to the contrary. So, in law, if you put that on the imaginary scale, it means what Prof. Obafunwa said outweighs every other evidence before the panel,\u201d he said.\n\nOnigbanjo further debunked the allegations that the panel made no reference to policemen nor took them into consideration.\n\n\u201cThey (JPI) issued two reports. The report that leaked only dealt with the issues from the Lekki Toll Gate. There is another report, which they issued which was not leaked; that report deals with all the EndSARS petitions that were about 253 in number and of the 253, policemen also brought their own petitions and in that report, the panel awarded a sum of about N36.2million to the policemen, who were affected one way or the other by the protests.\n\n\u201cSo, to be fair to them, they did consider the plights of the policemen too. And even if you look at most of their recommendations, they are for better welfare for the police, better equipment, more training, psychological evaluations. So, they took them into consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attorney-general, however, denied the allegations that Lagos State Government was put under pressure by the federal government to discredit the panel\u2019s report, adding that at no time did the state government encourage personal attacks against any members of the panel.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe federal government never put the Lagos State Government under any pressure to discredit the panel or anybody. If you check the records, nobody from Lagos State Government discredited the panel. In fact, they submitted the report on the 15th of November 2021, the governor praised them and thanked them for the job they did.\n\n\u201cEven yesterday, in his speech, which he made before the White Paper was released, he thanked them again. So, nobody from the Lagos State Government directly or indirectly has sought to discredit members of the panel. We appreciate the job they did for almost 13 months. We do not condone such attacks on anybody.\n\n\u201cI think we have conducted ourselves in such a manner that we strive to always do what is right. We complied with the law; we set up the panel. So, if we didn\u2019t even want the panel, there are so many ways it could have been stopped. They asked for an extension, we gave them. The initial funding was N200million; they exhausted it and asked for more, we gave them.\n\n\u201cWe appointed independent-minded people into the panel. And the panel itself said in its report that they give credit to the Lagos State Government for allowing them to be completely independent. Lagos State Government has fulfilled all its promises to the public. We set up an independent panel, we said we will release a White Paper and we did. We have complied with the law all the way.\u201d\n\nSegun James, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie",
