          "text": "The people of Eleme and Ogoni communities in Rivers State have decried the release of N2.5bn for compensation to reconstruct the Eleme section of the dilapidated East-West road.\n\nThe President General, Ogoni Youths Federation, Legborsi Yamaabana, expressed mixed feelings over the release of the money for the payment of compensation to property owners along the East-West road.\n\nYamaabana said, \u201cReleasing the part payment for compensation is not only diversionary but a grand attempt by Senator Godswill Akpabio to hoodwink and deceive the protesting youths to withdraw from the road.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the five-day-old mother of all protests remains at the forefront, which is the demand for the reconstruction of the entire stretch of the deplorable Ogoni axis of the East-West road (Eleme junction to Onne).\n\n\u201cWe expect the Federal Government to display good faith and mobilise contractors handing the road project to site to implement our demand and stop playing to the gallery.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the executive chairman, Ate Chinwi, said the people wanted a complete reconstruction of the road and not remedial work.\n\nChinwe, in an interview with our correspondent, said the Federal Government\u2019s approval was merely a statement without the details provided about the work to be done.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are quite sceptical and are observing. This is just a statement issued by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. But we don\u2019t know the scope of work to be done and how realistic this is.\n\n\u201cSo, RCC (the contracting firm) will have to come and if the minister can also avail himself, let us sit down and look at what is to be done and how to sustain it. We don\u2019t need remedial work anymore.\n\n\u201cYou and I know we have had remedial work on that road before and it still goes bad. So, pending a formal engagement, the Eleme local government chairman, who is the chief security officer, the (local government) area will issue a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, the RCC has to come down. The community wants to see them physically and have some kind of engagement with them to ascertain the scope and the level of commitment they have to sustain what they want to start,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, on Friday, at the last minute, allegedly cancelled an appointment he gave to a Yoruba group, Ooni\u2019s Caucus, on the alleged complaint that members of the group are \u201cnotorious critics\u201d of the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nThe Ooni\u2019s Caucus, which was inaugurated at the palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on July 20, 2021, is made of many influential Yoruba persons and is being coordinated by a former Managing Director of the News Agency of Nigeria, Mr Akin Osuntokun.\n\nSaturday PUNCH learnt that Osuntokun led about 14 members of the group to Alaafin\u2019s palace for the alleged 11am appointment on Friday, but after waiting for about two and a half hours, the influential monarch sent words to them that he would not be seeing them.\n\nAccording to a source, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH on condition of anonymity, some of the group\u2019s members who went to Alaafin\u2019s palace with Osuntokun were a monarch, the Olugbon of Orile-Igbon, Oba Francis Alao; a former presidential spokesman, Dr Doyin Okupe; a former commissioner in Osun State, Muyiwa Ige; a former Minister of Defence, Mrs Dupe Adelaja; a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Taiwo Lakanu, Oye Oyewumi, Sola Lawal, among others.\n\nA former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, is also said to be a member of Ooni\u2019s Caucus, but he was not on the delegation to Alaafin\u2019s palace on Friday.\n\nThe source, who is a member of the group, claimed that the group had through the Olugbon secured an appointment with Alaafin since Monday, and the same appointment was confirmed on Thursday, only for them to get to the palace and the Alaafin refused to see them on the claim that they were anti-Buhari and were also loyalists of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe source explained that the main purpose of the meeting was for the newly-inaugurated group to get Alaafin\u2019s blessings and to possibly discuss the issue of the embattled Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, who is currently being held and tried in Cotonou, Benin Republic.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe Olugbon, a member of the caucus, was the one who booked the appointment, but he said the Alaafin said he didn\u2019t want to see us because we\u2019re notorious critics of the Buhari government.\n\n\u201cHe (Alaafin) confirmed the appointment yesterday (Thursday). But when we got there today, he kept us waiting; after a while, he asked to see the Olugbon. He (Alaafin) didn\u2019t come to see us; we were told he said he wouldn\u2019t see us because we are notorious critics of Buhari\u2019s government and that some of us are close to Obasanjo, who is also critical of the government.\n\n\u201cWe were made to wait for about two and a half hours; he gave us an appointment for 11am; we got there at 11am and at about 1.30pm, that was when it was obvious to us that he wasn\u2019t coming (to see us). But he initially asked to see the Olugbon, who went to see him for about an hour. When the Olugbon eventually came back, he said Alaafin would not see us, saying we are a group that is critical of the Buhari government and some of us are loyalists of Obasanjo.\u201d\n\nOn whether the group\u2019s mission to Alaafin\u2019s palace was to discuss Sunday Igboho\u2019s matter, the source said, \u201cOf course, the issue (of Igboho) would come up but that was not the purpose of the visit. The issue of Igboho concerns all the Yoruba people but that was not our reason for going to him.\u201d\n\nOn whether the group would try and book another appointment, the source said, \u201cI don\u2019t know; we were all surprised that a Yoruba oba can refuse to see his children on account of not wanting to be on the bad side of Buhari\u2019s government. I would have thought that an oba is supposed to take everybody as his children, whether they are supporters of Buhari the All progressives Congress or the Peoples Democratic Party or whatever party.\u201d\n\nBut when contacted by Saturday PUNCH, the Media Director to the Alaafin, Bode Durojaye, said the reason his principal did not see the group was because they did not have any prior appointment with him.\n\nDurojaye said the Alaafin would be willing to entertain the group if they booked an appointment.\n\nHe said, \u201cThose who came are men of honour and kabiyesi did not say he did not want to see them. He did not say he would not see them because they are critical of President Buhari or they are former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s men. Obasanjo himself is a friend of Kabiyesi, so you can see that what you were told was not what happened.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi said he could not see them because they did not give him prior notice that they were coming. That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t want to see them again. They can notify him and he will give them an appointment. You cannot just come and say you want to see him, there are protocols to follow and due process is always adhered to at Alaafin\u2019s Palace.\n\n\u201cThere was no rancour, no ill-feeling even when they were going; I was there and I saw them off to their vehicles. If anybody told you that kabiyesi said he didn\u2019t want to see them because they are critical of government or they are Obasanjo\u2019s men, that is a lie.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022As Jaiz Foundation doles out N10m to 75 needy\n\nImam Abdul Hakeem Abdul Lateef has commended Jaiz foundation for the empowerment initiative to the needy in the society while urging other non-governmental organizations to engage in similar projects by assisting people around them.\n\n\n\nAccording to the former Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs, Poverty is one of the major cause of crime in society.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that so many people are idle and challenged would encourage crime. This sort of initiative will greatly reduce that.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring his lecture on Zakat, Sadaqah and You, Imam Abdul Lateef said Zakat, one of the pillars of Islam was established by Allah to ensure the even distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria has so much but people have flagrantly disregarded the need to give even within their immediate family. People rather outshine one another in irrelevancies and show off. Allah blessed us so we can be charitable to the needy, orphans, neighbors and parents.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigerians need to assist one another. Apart from the government, we also need to assist one another. Being charitable transcends government. If an individual is in government and he isn\u2019t charitable, he will not be able to discharge his duties. Charity involves selflessness, thinking of the next person, and multiplying their happiness. It is a duty of the government and the governed to be charitable.\n\nIf the charity is as it should be, poverty and suffering would have reduced. Everyone will be accountable on the day of judgement,\u201d he emphasized.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CEO of Jaiz charity and development foundation, Dr Abdullah Shuaib, the N10 million disbursed to the 75 beneficiaries was both in cheque and empowerment items. He stated that the empowerment items such as 3 industrial machines, stone engraving machine, 3 deep freezer, 3 generator set, 3 pepper grinding machine, 2 laptops were all requested by the needy. Cheques, he added were disbursed to those who needed money for starting their business. While some would be given 500,000, there are those who would be given 250,000, 350,000 and some were given N50,000.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur intervention in the past has reflected that their business became expanded and this would alleviate poverty in our society. More people will be engaged and we believe that these people would be self-sufficient and they will no longer be dependent on people and that will prevent many from asking for alms from people. The empowerment will make them have what they can earn from, a legitimate source of livelihood.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further said, \u201cWe are still in the formative stage of our intervention using the Zakat fund. The foundation started the disbursement in 2016. We do other interventions without using the Zakat fund and we are doing well in those areas especially in the North East, West and Central.\u201d\n\n\n\nA beneficiary, Monsurah Maadan Tajudeen said she heard about the Jaiz donation through a sister. The trained fashion designer told our correspondent that the sewing and heat steam machine giving to her would empower her. She hinted she would rent a shop, put the machines to good use by making Islamic items such as hijabs, jilbabs, shirts with the machines donated to her.\n\n\n\nShe expressed her appreciation to the foundation for the empowerment initiative.\n\nAnother beneficiary, Salman Lukman who has been practising as a pest control and horticulture expert who also specializes in post-construction cleaning, Dot Clean venture, disclosed that the cheque donations he received would be used in purchasing more machines as well as expanding his business. \u201cWith this type of empowerment program, many unemployed will be out of the street,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Wole Mosadomi\n\nFOLLOWING the incessant raid of many communities including boarding schools in Niger State, the government has shut down 10 out of its 56 existing boarding schools.\n\nIt has consequently relocated those affected to safer schools to continue their education. Those given priority in the relocation are SSS 3 students who are currently writing their NECO.\n\nThe State Commissioner of Education, Hajiya Hannatu Jibrin Salihu, who disclosed this while answering questions from journalists after the State Executive Council presided by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello in Minna, yesterday, said the closed-down boarding schools were considered part of the \u201chigh risk\u201d boarding schools likely to be invaded by kidnappers.\n\n\n\nShe explained: \u201cAfter carrying out security assessment of our schools, we considered some as very \u201chigh risk\u201d and this is why we had to close down the schools and relocate the students immediately.\n\n\u201cWe are still compiling those schools to be fenced at least to provide security for the students but the slim purse of the government is slowing down the take-off of the project.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe commissioner, however, said that the state government has taken steps to renovate the sixty-year-old Ahmadu Bahago secondary school, Minna, at a cost of N427million to bring it to a high standard adding that this has been approved by the State executive council. This according to her is part of the \u201cWhole School Renovation\u201d programme of the state government to give a facelift to the schools in the state.\n\nAccording to her, The State Government has planned to embark on the security perimeter fencing of all its 400 public secondary schools in the state but due to paucity of fund, it is yet to commence the exercise and therefore decided to close down some boarding Schools.\n\n\n\nThe Education commissioner noted that, despite the security challenges confronting the state, 25 boarding schools in the State are still in operation as they are considered to be operating in relatively low-security atmosphere.\n\n\n\nHajiya Hannatu further said the remaining 21 boarding Schools were converted to Day schools in order to allow the students to continue their education without disruption in the locality.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe risk assessment of schools is now a continuous exercise as we work hand in hand with PTAs and other stakeholders to actualize our dream,\u201d she remarked.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Allen Onyema\n\nBy Nnamdi Ojiego\n\nChairman/Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace Airline, Chief Allen Onyema, has said there was never a time he called those agitating for separate nations cowards.\n\nOnyema was reacting to a news report in a national daily (not Vanguard), titled, \u201cOnyema Blasts Secessionists as Cowards\u201d. In an exclusive interview with Vanguard, the Air Peace boss described the report as misrepresentation of facts.\n\nAccording to him, the headline of report was different from the body, thereby making it possible for other news blogs to interprete the newspaper\u2019s false headlines to mean IPOB and other agitators.\n\nRecall that a news publication had on Thursday, reported that Onyema, while speaking in Lagos at the 25th League of Airport and Aviation Correspondents, LAAC, conference, described those calling for break up of Nigeria as cowards who could flee the country at the slightest opportunity.\n\nHe maintained that he never called members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and the Yoruba nation agitators, cowards, as he was only canvassing for peaceful resolution of issues in the country, and urged the Federal Government to address concerns of the agitators.\n\nHe said, \u201cI never called IPOB or anybody cowards. What I preached in that forum was peace and for people to eschew violence. Yes, IPOB, Yoruba nation or Arewa have their reasons for doing whatever they are doing. So, we shouldn\u2019t go into bickering or into outright condemnation. All we should do is to look at why they are agitating and try to bring them to discussion table and address the issues. And I believe the country will be better for it at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not here to condemn IPOB or to praise them, neither am I here to praise Sunday Igboho nor to condemn him. I\u2019m also not here to condemn Arewa group or to praise them. What I always preach to everybody, be it Arewa, Yoruba nation or IPOB or any group at that matter, is peace. It is not in my character to condemn people. All I\u2019m preaching is let peace be given a chance. Government should address those issues they were complaining about.\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u201cI was only encouraging people in every part of the country to eschew violence because those who do violence are cowards. Those that are cowards are those who do armed robbery, suicide bombing, kidnapping, and banditry amongst other violent crimes because they can\u2019t brace up with their situation and tackle it peacefully.\n\n\u201cSo, I never called agitators cowards because not everybody that says I want to secede is violent. I also didn\u2019t use the word IPOB or Yoruba nation or Arewa. Therefore, there is no way I could have called those doing agitation cowards. I didn\u2019t. I only called for peaceful resolution of issues\u201d, he emphasised.\n\nContinuing, Onyema, who was instrumental to the dialogue with the Niger Delta militants that culminated in the federal government\u2019s amnesty programme, added, \u201cI am not saying there are no injustices in the country. We want a country where justice, equity and fairness actually reign, no doubt about that. But we can address these issues peacefully.\n\n\u201cI will like to be an instrument of saving this nation from crisis because I believe that one doesn\u2019t need to be a president or governor to contribute their own quota. What I did in the Niger Delta, no government did it, not even the international community. Nobody gave me an iota of belief that this could happen without arms. Nobody ever knew that Niger Delta issues would come to an end at the time it happened.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We also put on record that you have assisted us to use press release where in we reported that the national Secretariat officers sent to Osogbo were hijacked, ambushed and kept from being accessed by other stakeholders in the party. And by inference, did not sell a single form to all other interested parties within the APC.\n\n\u201cWhen the Osun Progressives (TOP) get to its wit\u2019s end in getting the forms from those sent from Abuja, we procured the forms directly from the National Secretariat by substituted means.\n\n\n\nHitherto, the Governor\u2019s group, IleriOluwa had boasted all over the places that it was going to have consensus of returning all members of the outgoing executives. As a matter of fact, they were going to have the assumed consensus arrangement yesterday only for them to bitterly learn that we have gotten forms.\n\n\u201cThey hurriedly cancelled the elaborate arrangements they made to announce the incorrigible consensus. Our observation is that they are scared of contests since they know that the current leadership has mismanaged the party to the present extent.\n\n\u201cThey know that they are incapable of winning popular votes in fair and free contest hence the employment of tactics to have a hitch-free democratic Congress held. Were they to be popular and have capacity to win, why did they hijack the national Secretariat officers and held them incommunicado since they arrived the state?\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the Ward Congress Committee appointed by the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning committee arrived Osogbo this morning. They are said to have been in the Government house with Governor Gboyega Oyetola since. They are circumventing the popular rule of democratic engagement by not allowing the committees to interact with stakeholders in consequent with how things will go tomorrow. But like it happened to the earlier delegation in sales of forms, no party member is in the know of anything.\n\n\u201cWe note that consensus which they desired is no stranger to us as true Progressives but its definition is not that a viewpoint of one of many stakeholders will be taken that of everyone. Consensus is an agreement which is a product of discussion among stakeholders. Nobody claps with one hand. APC is a political party which emerged as an aggregation of different interests and viewpoints. No one can force his/her views on others.\n\n\u201cWe at the Osun Progressives (TOP) will not accept that. It is in this regard that we once more draw the attention of Governor Mai Mala Buni\u2019s committee to the ungracious insults been passed on democratic tenets by Governor Oyetola\u2019s group, IleriOluwa and indeed the intelligence of party members in Osun. We hope the Ward Congress committee members just arriving Osogbo are pious of sterling character who exercise fairness to all stakeholders within the party.\n\n\u201cHaving come this far, we state in categorical terms that we are ready for contest tomorrow if there will be fairness and justice.\n\n\n\nMay God bless our party to be able to regain its waning strength and go back to its election-winning streak in this Congress.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Some youths who are members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State have accused Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and Caretaker Chairman of the APC, Prince Gboyega Famodun of committing electoral fraud ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ward congress of the party.\n\nThe youths who staged a protest on the Gbongan-Ibadan road, Ogo-Oluwa, Osogbo, today alleged Oyetola and Famodun of hijacking the nomination forms brought by some national officials of the APC.\n\nAccording to the group, the national officials who came to Osogbo last week Saturday were camped at a hotel under security surveillance and were barred from relating with any other members of the party in the state.\n\nThe youths who came under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement called on the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to intervene in the matter and ensure that there is free and fair ward congress in the state.\n\nSpeaking at the Secretariat, one of the leaders of the group, Mr Rasheed Raji, said: \u201cWe are here to protest the electoral fraud being committed by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and the APC Chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun. The two leaders of the party are clearly killing APC in the State of Osun.\n\n\u201cOur party at the national level sent committee members led by one Abdullahi down to Osun since last week Saturday to begin sales of form and preparation for the congress. But ever since they arrived, the committee members are nowhere to be found. They are not either at the State Party Secretariat or any other place carrying out their national duty.\n\n\u201cThousands of our members have paid for the nomination forms to participate in the ward congress but were not given form. Only members of Governor Oyetola\u2019s group, IleriOluwa were given form. This is a plan to manipulate the congress. The National Secretariat of our party should know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to take our protest to the State Secretariat of our party but the Governor has stationed political thugs there. They planned to attack us and we do not want bloodshed. But our voice will be heard. We don\u2019t want consensus in Osun and the congress committee should be allowed to do its job.\n\nAmong the protesters was Mrs Opeyemi Adetipe who condemned what he described as brazen balkanization of the party by Governor Oyetola and Famodun, accusing them of intimidating and harassing members of the party who do not belong to their camp.\n\nAdetipe said the alleged hijacking of the nomination forms by the duo is evidence of the politics of division and self-destruction being played by both the Governor and the party chairman.\n\nShe called on the national leaders of the party to rescue the soul of Osun APC and its members from Governor Oyetola and Famodun.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to go to the party Secretariat but they have stationed thugs there. The Governor is intimidating every member of the party who does not belong to his group, IleriOluwa.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Not the best of time for Team Nigeria at the on-going Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games following the disqualification of 10 athletes by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) of World Athletics as the track and field events of Tokyo 2020 kick off today. OLALEKAN OKUSAN and OLUWAMAYOMIKUN OREKOYA write on the development following the crisis that engulfed the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) ahead of the quadrennial games.\n\nNigeria\u2019s chances in the track & field events of the Tokyo 2020 suffered a huge blow on Wednesday after the Athletic integrity Unit (AIU) banned 10 of the 22 athletes for not meeting up to the required doping tests in the run-up to the delayed games.\n\nThe AIU is an independent body created by World Athletics (WA) to manage both doping and non-doping issues for the sports of athletics.\n\nAccording to AIU on Rule 15 of the National Federation Anti-Doping Obligations introduced in 2019, it stated inter alia that \u2018in the 10 months before the Olympics, any athlete from a Category A country needs to face at least three no-notice, out-of-competition doping tests, which must be conducted at least three weeks apart\u2019.\n\nCategory A Federations are deemed to have the highest doping risk and considered as a threat to the overall integrity of the sport; and Nigeria was included in this infamous threat at the start of 2020 following a continued period of weak domestic testing levels.\n\nThe athletes that were barred from competing included Ruth Usoro, Favour Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma, Annette Echikunwoke, Chioma Onyekwere, Knowledge Omovoh, Chidi Okezie, Glory Patrick, Tima Seikeseye Godbless and Yinka Ajayi.\n\nBut Sprinter Blessing Okagbare who is one of the 12 athletes cleared for Nigeria, was quick to slam those saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the sport especially negligence of the welfare of the athletes.\n\nOkagbare posited on her social media account: \u201cI have said it before and I will say it again. If you do not know the sport, not passionate about it/Us (the athletes), then you have no business there as an administrator. The sport system in Nigeria is so flawed and we athletes are always at the receiving end of the damages.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThey were busy fighting over power, exercising their pride over puma contract/kits forgetting their major responsibility- \u201cTHE ATHLETES\u201d. It\u2019s sad that this cycle keeps repeating its self and some people will come out to say I am arrogant for speaking\u2026my truth. It is my CAREER.\u201d\n\nOlympian and former Team Nigeria captain Yusuf Alli is pained with the disqualification of the 10 athletes since most of them were to make their Olympics debut, describing it as a major setback to the country\u2019s quest for medals at Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nHe lamented that such a situation has never happened to Nigeria during his national team career, blaming the situation on the crisis rocking the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN).\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that when those in charge were supposed to be focusing on getting the right things done, they were busying fighting over the Puma kits deals and this is what you get when the right things are not done at the right time,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe, however, said that the Nigeria Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) should be decentralized for all federations to be accessible for the agency to conduct regular doping tests for elite athletes across all sports.\n\n\u201cI think it is time we decentralized NADA so that all sports federations can have access to them and conduct regular tests for our elite athletes in all sports. Now it is athletics that we are talking about, it will soon spread to other sports especially football where no test is conducted in our leagues,\u201d Alli counselled.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate that the likes of Blessing Okagbare and Tobi Amusan are competing in the circuits where regular tests were conducted but some of our athletes in American colleges were not tested because they are not competing for the US.\n\n\u201cWhat would have helped us is for the AFN to plead with the US athletics to assist in conducting doping tests for our athletes. It is painful that some of these athletes will not be making their debuts in Tokyo again with this development,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the affected athletes, Chidi Okezie is heartbroken, adding the disqualification is capable of affecting his mental health.\n\n\u201cWe just want to know what\u2019s going on. We are in this hotel stressing out. My mental health is in danger. Please do not think this is a joke. I am close to a breakdown because they told me that I will not be able to compete because we did not meet the required anti-doping guidelines,\u201d he fumed.\n\nYet Bambo Akani, an athletics meet organiser and administrator was even more forthcoming about what might have transpired: \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite surprising that it is mostly the US-based athletes who did not have the requisite number of OCTs, while nearly all the home-based athletes on Nigeria\u2019s team were cleared to compete \u2013 it actually shows that Out of Competition Testing (OCT) is happening in Nigeria as it should, while there has been a breakdown in the correct process that should be happening with Nigeria\u2019s Athletes in the US.\u201d\n\nThe MoC founder and CEO added: \u201cIt is possible that some of them were not aware of or not filling their whereabouts forms so that the testers would know where to find them out of the competition on any given day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel for the current US Collegiate athletes who may be more inexperienced in such matters, and this is where it is Nigeria\u2019s failure not to have frequently checked in with all of our Olympic hopefuls to ensure that they were getting their OCTs done. I hope this will be a teachable moment for our nation and hopefully the new AFN board will mark the change in professionalism that is needed to ensure that such can never happen to Nigeria\u2019s Olympic athletes again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has taken responsibility for the disqualification of 10 members of Team Nigeria from competing in the track and field events at the Tokyo Olympic Games following their failure to meet up with the minimum testing requirements under Rule 15 of the Anti-Doping Rules.\n\nThe AFN President, Tonobock Okowa, has also announced the appointment of Professor Ken Anugweje as the federation\u2019s head of its Medical and Anti- Doping Commission.\n\n\u201cAFN bears responsibility for any lapses that may have occurred during the process and reassures Nigerians that our athletes\u2019 performances will not be negatively impacted,\u201d Okowa said. \u201cThe Athletics Federation of Nigeria has put in place appropriate measures to comply with Rule 15 of the Anti-Doping Rules of World Athletics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has taken proactive steps to avoid future occurrences by appointing Prof. Ken Anugweje as the head of the Medical and Anti- Doping Commission of the Federation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe AFN president added that while all local-based and top athletes based abroad completed their test, it was the test of the US-based college athletes that didn\u2019t meet the Olympic requirements.\n\n\u201cAll our athletes resident in Nigeria and who qualified for the Olympic Games completed the three mandatory tests,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of our top athletes residing in the USA also completed their tests. However, a few athletes in the American collegiate system were tested, but those tests were deemed not to have complied with WADA sample collection and analysis standards. It must be noted that no Nigerian athlete tested positive to prohibited substances.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development also expressed its regrets of the unfortunate development of 10 athletes not meeting the testing conditions of the AIU.\n\nHowever, reigning Nigeria sprint queen and 100/200m record holder, Blessing Okagbare tops the list of 12 athletes AIU has cleared to compete in the athletics event of the on-going Tokyo 2020 Olympics which begins today.\n\nOkagbare who is making her fourth appearance at the games will be competing in the women\u2019s 100m heat today.\n\nAlso cleared to contest are sprint hurdler, Tobiloba Amusan who is ranked number four in the 100m hurdles; long jumper Ese Brume who tops the world list in her event coming to the games and Grace Nwokocha, the home-based sensation who clocked 11.09 seconds in March at the MOC Grand Prix in Lagos to seal her qualification for the Tokyo Games. Others are the trio of Divine Oduduru, Enoch Adegoke and Ushoritse Itshekiri will be competing in the men\u2019s 100m while Oduduru will also race in the 200m, an event he holds the national record of 19.73 seconds which he set two years ago in Austin, Texas in the USA to win the NCAA gold.\n\nShot putter Chukwuebuka Enekwechi who made it to the event\u2019s final at the World Athletics Championship in Doha, Qatar in 2019 is also cleared to compete. The 4x400m mixed relay quartet of Imaobong Nse Uko, Patience Okon-George, Nataniel Samson, and Ifeanyi Ojeli were also cleared to compete and will be in action today in the first semi-final heat.",

          "text": "By Emma Njoku, Ndubuisi Orji, Molly Kilete and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nA United States District Court has ordered the arrest of the Head, Nigerian Inspector General of Police\u2019sIntelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT) and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abba Kyari, for his alleged role in a multi-million dollar fraud perpetrated by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, and his co-conspirators.\n\nA court document obtained by the media revealed that Otis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to track down Kyari and produce him in the U.S, for his role in large scale international fraud.\n\nHushpuppi, who was arrested in Dubai in June last year, has pleaded guilty to the fraud charges in the U.S. The FBI said Hushpuppi and Kyari, both of whom it alleged had been friends, conspired to launder money.\n\nThe FBI also indicted Kyari for allegedly receiving bribes from Hushpuppi to arrest a member of the syndicate in Nigeria. If found guilty of the allegation, Kyari may be jailed for 20 years.\n\n\u201cA criminal complaint and an indictment contain allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cBoth conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term,\u201d the court document revealed. Judge Wright\u2019s order for the FBI to arrest Mr Kyari and hold him in U.S. custody was unsealed on July 26.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, has denied allegations of conspiracy with Hushpuppi, claiming that he only met him two years ago and never demanded nor collect any bribe from him.\n\nKyari, who made the clarification on his Facebook page, said those celebrating the allegations by the internet fraudster against him would be disappointed and put to shame.\n\nHe said: \u201cFriends: Abbas, who we later came to know as Hushpuppi, called our office about two years ago that somebody seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria, and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family. We traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life, and they were long time friends who had money issues, hence, we released the suspect on bail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and said he liked them. He was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300,000 directly to the person\u2019s account. The native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\n\u2022IGP orders his probe\n\nInspector General of Police(IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered an investigation into the alleged indictment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), against Abba Kyari.\n\nForce public relations officer, Frank Mba, who made this known in Abuja, also confirmed the receipt of the said allegations by the FB, by the police force headquarters.\n\nMba assured the commitment of the Nigerian Police to conduct a through investigation so as not to jeopardise its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners. The Force PRO in a statement yesterday in Abuja said: \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police,Usman Alkali Baba has ordered an internal review of the allegations. The Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners. Further developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\n\u2022Go clear your name in US- HURIWA\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA) has advised the Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, to file and defend a counter affidavit of accusation of bribery made against him by a fraud suspect, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi in the United States.\n\nA US court had said that Hushpuppi allegedly used Kyari to arrest and jail a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, after the latter threatened to expose a $1million fraud committed against a Qatari businessman.\n\nAlthough Kyari had denied allegations of conspiracy with Hushpuppi, URIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, yesterday, said Kyari should not be scared of injustice because of the transparent nature of the judicial system in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is an organised Constitutional democracy, where the rule of law is supreme. So, if a crime suspect makes an affidavit accusation under oath against you, it doesn\u2019t need to be disclaimed in the local media here.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do even before the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses the services of the INTERPOL to hunt you down, as someone who is sure that his conscience is clear, is to take the next available flight to Washington DC or New York, to connect to the court room, then use a legal representation to file and defend yourself through an affidavit evidence to counter what you think is a tissue of falsehood.\n\n\u201cTelling us this cock-and-bull story of how you, a very senior police officer, acted as the agent of a local tailor, is irrelevant and of no moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022PDP demands full investigation\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded a forensic investigation into reports by the United States (US) FBI linking head of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, to Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, described the news about Kyari\u2019s alleged involvement in receipt of proceeds of international fraud as worrisome and a stain on the integrity of Nigeria.\n\nThe opposition party charged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the IGP, Usman Baba, to question Kyari, and if found culpable, he should be handed over to the FBI.\n\n\u201cIt is, indeed, disquieting that the integrity of our nation has fallen so abysmally low under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, to the extent that the head of its police intelligence unit is being charged in connection with international fraud.\n\n\u201cOur party demands that the APC administration should not sweep this matter under the carpet given the manifest rapport between Kyari and some top APC leaders.\n\n\u201cWe urge President Buhari not to \u201cease out\u201d this case of corruption but, immediately, restore the integrity and image of our nation, by allowing a forensic investigation on the suspect.\n\n\u201cMoreover, if this Abba Kyari matter is not well handled, it will be a permanent stain on the reputation of our police, security system and our nation at large,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Bassey Inyang\n\nThe Court of Appeal sitting in Calabar has declared the Member representing Obudu/Yala Federal Constituency Hon. Jerigbe Agom Jarigbe of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as Senator elect for Cross River North senatorial district.\n\nIn a judgement delivered on Friday, the three man Appeal Tribunal headed by Hon. Justice Chioma I. Nwosu, held that Jarigbe was the lawful candidate of the PDP for the December 5th, 2020 By-election, and not Dr. Steven Odey.\n\nConsequently, the Court invalidated the Certificate of Return earlier issued to Odey by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nFriday\u2019s judgement invalidated the June 18th, 2021 judgement of the Cross River State Election Petitions Tribunal which declared that Odey was the authentic candidate of the PDP.\n\nDelivering judgement in consolidated Suit No CAL/C/NAEA/SEN/167/2021, the Appeal Court said the election tribunal, erred in law by ignoring earlier judgements by superior courts that recognised and declared Jarigbe as candidate of the PDP and winner of the by-election.\n\n\u201cIt is our humble and firm view that the issue calls for consideration whether the tribunal was right to jettison the decision of the High Court, Appeal Court and Supreme Court and declare the 1st Respondent (Odey) as validly elected,\u201d the Appeal Court said.\n\n\n\nContinuing, the court said, \u201cThe tribunal is bound by the decisions of superior Courts on the same issue,\u201d adding that \u201cThe law does not allow the tribunal to take a different position as the law has already affirmed that Hon. Jarigbe is the lawful candidate of the PDP\u201d.\n\nStressing that the Appeal court is bound by decisions of courts superior to the trial courts, the Appeal court panel headed by Justice Nwosu declared Jarigbe as the Senator Elect for Cross River North Senatorial District.\n\nThe Appeal court also stated that the PDP held the primary election that threw up Odey in contempt of a court order that had directed that only the authentic list of delegates for the nomination of candidate should be used for the secondary election.\n\nIn ordering INEC to issue a Certificate of Return to Jarigbe, the Appeal Court said: \u201cTwo certificates of return cannot exist in the eye of the law. The judgment of the election tribunal is hereby set aside.\u201d\n\nThe petition of the All Progressives Congress ( APC) candidate, Joe Agi, SAN, whose case against Jarigbe and Odey was part of the consolidated appeal, was dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nAgi had argued that while Odey was an impostor having failed to clinch the ticket of the PDP to contest the by-election, Jarigbe though recognized as the candidate of the PDP by the Supreme court didn\u2019t contest the election of December 5, 2020, because he didn\u2019t submit nomination forms to INEC, and didn\u2019t participate in all stages of elections as required by Section 141 of Electoral Act and Section 285(13) of 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Jerigbe counsel, Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, who was represented by Mr. Joe Oloko, said the judgement was a welcome development for deepening the roots of democracy in the country, especially as it related to intra-party democracy.\n\nHe said the judgement was very much in order because the Appeal court could not have overruled the superior courts that had declared Jarigbe candidate of the PDP and winner of the December 5, 2020 by-election.\n\nWith this judgement, Odey\u2019s membership of the Senate is short lived because the Appeal court is the last appellate court that can adjudicate on appeals over judgements of election petitions tribunal on National Assembly matters.\n\n\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

While a majority of party members were convinced the situation portended serious crisis for the party, a few others were of the view that the party was on the right path.\n\nIn its split judgment of four against three by the seven member-panel, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, the Supreme Court had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join the National Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker Committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nExpectedly, this development had immediately divided the stakeholders in the APC over Buni\u2019s continued stay, both as national chairman of the party and governor of Yobe State.\n\nSection 183 of the 1999 constitution unequivocally forbids a sitting governor from combining his office with any other job, both as executive positions, same as Article 17 (iv)of the APC constitution.\n\nInterestingly, this aspect of the judgement, though simplified by the Supreme Court justices, has since ruffled feathers in the APC as it has the capacity to also affect the party in the forthcoming November 6 governorship election in Anambra State as well as the ward congresses of the party expected to commence Saturday nationwide.\n\nFor instance, the fate of Senator Andy Uba, candidate of the APC is currently uncertain as the party, as was the case in Zamfara, might be unable to field any candidate for the election.\n\nAnd despite the party\u2019s seeming attempt to brush off the grave implications of the judgment, top echelons of the APC are worried of the potential minefield it has set itself up against.\n\nThe majority decision of the Supreme Court delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, clearly held that the failure of the appellants to include Buni as a party was fatal to their case, because all the issues in the appeal revolved around Buni and ought to have been made a party.\n\nAlthough Justice Mary Odili, in a dissenting minority verdict, upheld Jegede\u2019s appeal that the nomination of Akeredolu, which was signed by Buni was not valid under Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThus, many of APC\u2019s big wigs couldn\u2019t believe how close they came to losing Ondo to the PDP and that the only saving grace was that, the appellant \u2013 either by providence or commission \u2013 failed to include Buni as a party in the suit.\n\nAlready, the APC in Zamfara State has taken the party to court asking it to declare as illegal, the fact that Buni has continued to combine the two of offices of governor and national chairman being executive positions, adding that it contravened both the constitution of APC and the country, the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nIt was against this backdrop, that some aides of President Muhammadu Buhari called for the sack of the national caretaker committee of the party and a suspension of tomorrow\u2019s congresses in the immediate.\n\nSoon after the judgement, Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo (SAN), was the first to advise the APC to halt all preparations and conduct of congresses nationwide forthwith, having analysed the implications of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe planned congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended, because it will be an exercise in futility as analysed above. The competence of Governor Mai Mala Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe NEC of the party can urgently meet and consider and reconstitute the CECPC to exclude, not only Governor Buni, but anyone holding any executive position in any government establishment as stipulated in Article 17 of the APC Constitution,\u201d Keyamo said.\n\nApart from Keyamo, two senior officials in the presidency, the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu and Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang have also joined the call for the Buni committee to be disbanded.\n\nOjudu and Enang, in a joint statement, also said the judgement appeared to have swept the carpet of legality off the committee, rendering it illegal, null, void and of no legal capacity to undertake any action on behalf and in the name of the party.\n\nThey said it has also brought to question, the legality of all the actions taken by the Buni-committee since inception.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in view of the impending ward, local government, states and zonal congresses and indeed the national convention (which the CECPC was primarily set up to do), it is our view that the ward and other congresses scheduled for July 31, 2021 be paused, suspended and put on hold pending the determination of the legal status of the CECPC to undertake all the activities it so far has, and indeed jurisdiction to conduct the congresses and convention.\n\n\u201cThat the party carefully and dispassionately cause her team of legal experts to review, appraise and give considered opinion on the import of the majority and in extreme particular the reasonings in the minority judgment of the Supreme Court as to the legal Status of the CECPC to proceed further with any activity in the name of the party or otherwise.\n\n\u201cThat option, including painful ones be recommended to perfect the party leadership in the eyes of the law with legal capacity to do what it ought to do. That the team also recommend measures to perfect matters in respect of pending elections and matters to rescue challenged pending processes.\n\n\u201cThat Time being of the essence, very limited timelines be set for each of the proposed steps. One cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand.\n\n\u201cFinally, this being a Supreme Court judgement, we should be thankful that it has come very early that it will guide our Party to victory in 2023 as we mind carefully the legal Status of our systems, guiding us on avoidable actions as we approach the 2023 tape to brace successfully,\u201d the statement read.\n\nBut the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo Agege, has objected to the position of the aides of the president and others.\n\nIn his legal opinion, he said, \u201cWednesday 28th, July, 2021, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment dismissing the appeal initiated by Eyitayo Jegede against the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Surprisingly, mischief-makers for obviously nefarious intensions, resort to misinterpret the said judgment vis-a-vis the purport of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), as it affects the APC Congresses scheduled for Saturday.\n\n\u201cWithout much ado, it is important to state that the majority decision of the Supreme Court in Jegede\u2019s case, emphatically dismissed the appeal and did not consider the issue of the provisions of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution, neither did the majority decision make any comments on the competence of Governor Mai Mala Buni as the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee. The appeal was dismissed on the ground of competence or lack thereof for the non-joinder of a necessary party to the suit at the lower court.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, disingenuous, unsound and mischievous to attempt to misinform the reading public of what was not the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the court. Even if the apex court had considered the provisions of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution, the majority panel would still have dismissed the appeal.\n\n\u201cHaving established the above point, it is necessary to proceed to clear the gross misconception of the provisions of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe sole question that begs for consideration is whether the appointment of Governor Mai Mala Buni as the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman offends the provisions of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended)?\n\n\u201cIn answering the above question, it is pertinent to reproduce the provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) as follows: the governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing constitutional provisions, the question becomes: Is the appointment of a Governor to Chair a Caretaker Committee of his political party, same not being an \u2018Executive Office\u2019 in respect of which he is to be paid remuneration, incompetent?\n\n\u201cCan it be said that a State Governor, who is the Chairman of the Governors Forum of Nigeria is occupying an \u201cExecutive office\u201d? Can it also be argued that the President cannot be appointed as the Chairman of Africa Union?\n\n\u201cFrom the explicit provision of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), it is absolutely impossible and untenable to argue that the provisions of Section 183 bars a Governor from being a Chairman or member of a Caretaker Committee set up by his or her political party.\n\n\u201cMore so, the position of the Chairman of a Caretaker Committee cannot by any sense of imagination, logic or simple common sense be classified as a being a salaried Executive office.\n\n\u201cIt is important at this point to restate the fact, that the Caretaker Committee was duly constituted by the NEC of the party and given a specific mandate to put necessary measures in place to conduct a seamless elective National Convention.\n\n\u201cThere is no law under our legal jurisprudence that bars or prohibits a Governor who is a member of a political party and won elections under the political party from carrying out specific assignments on-behalf of his party. How this will amount to holding an Executive office is beyond every stretch of human comprehension.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing exposition, it is humbly and firmly stated that Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) only bars a Governor from holding Executive positions like being a Minister, or any other executive positions for which he shall be paid for.\n\n\u201cIt does not by any scintilla of imagination, render the appointment of Governor Buni as APC Caretaker Committee Chairman incompetent and will not in anyway, affect the legality or competence of the APC scheduled Congresses.\u201d Omo Agege stated\n\nFor the record, however, Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution is clear and states that no official of the party shall at same time hold any executive position in any government institution.\n\nTherefore, the argument that being party chairman is not an executive position may not apply here in the case of the APC constitution, which states clearly that, \u201cno official of this party can hold any position in any government institution.\u201d\n\nIn other words, even if supporters of Buni were interpreting Nigeria\u2019s constitution upside down, they cannot do the same to the party\u2019s constitution, which states that no official of its shall hold any position in any government. That, of course, is considered clear enough.\n\nBy implication, if the APC goes ahead and holds the congresses, it might turn out an effort in futility.\n\nUnfortunately, the first casualty of this poor choice by the APC might be the party\u2019s candidate in the Anambra State governorship election, Senator Andy Uba.\n\nWhile some members have conceded Uba\u2019s fate to time, others, who were convinced about the position of the law in the case have concluded that the APC has no candidate in the Anambra election.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s forget it, we are only wasting our time. The Supreme Court has spoken, so, what do we want again? All what Senator Ovie Omo-Agege is saying is rubbish,\u201d a top member of the party and government, held last night.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*US court orders arrest of top cop\n\n*Force headquarters rattled by development\n\n*My hands are clean, says Kyari\n\nChuks Okocha and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nApparently stunned by the scale of allegations of corruption, abuse of power and torture of suspects, levelled against one of Nigeria\u2019s most decorated police officers, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari, by Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered an internal review of Kyari\u2019s involvement, in a series of crimes committed by a notorious internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas otherwise called Hushpuppi.\n\nBaba\u2019s order followed a United States Court order of arrest of Kyari, issued by a District Court of California.\n\nThe IG\u2019s order did not, however, come as a surprise as competent police sources had earlier hinted THISDAY that the police authority was rattled by the development and might soon issue a statement to state its position.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned but we are working on something (response)\u201d, one of the sources claimed.\n\nBut, unfazed, Kyari had also denied the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, where he insisted that, \u201cmy hands are clean\u201d.\n\nThat notwithstanding, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded a full investigation of the alleged involvement of Kyari in the fraud allegations against Abbas.\n\nIn a two-paragraph statement issued by the IG, tagged: \u201cAlleged Indictment of DCP Abba Kyari: Inspector-General Of Police Orders A Review of the Information\u201d and signed by the Force Public Relations Officer, Commissioner of Police Frank Mba, Baba assured the Nigerian people of justice at the end of the day.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police IGP Usman Alkali Baba psc (+), NPM, fdc has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners. Further developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Otis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to arrest Kyari and produce him in the United States for his role in a $1.1million fraud.\n\nSome US Court documents further showed that American prosecutors had first sought a court warrant to arrest Kyari on February 12, 2021, while another request was made on April 29, 2021.\n\nBut Judge Wright\u2019s permission for the FBI to arrest Kyari and hold him in US custody, it was further gathered, was unsealed on July 26, 2021.\n\nHushpuppi had narrated to the US court how he allegedly bribed Kyari to arrest and jail one of his rivals in Nigeria over a disputed sharing formula of $1.1million scam of a Qatari businessman.\n\nThe US court papers also revealed that Yusuf Adekinka Anifowoshe, a.k.a. \u201cAJ,\u201d 26, of Brooklyn, New York, allegedly played a role in the fraud, assisting Abbas with a call to the victim posing as \u201cMalik.\u201d\n\nSpecial agents with the FBI, however, arrested Anifowoshe in New York on July 22. The conspirators allegedly defrauded the victim of more than $1.1 million.\n\nThe proceeds of the fraud were allegedly laundered in several ways.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Abbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. \u201cMorayo,\u201d 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. \u201cBolamide,\u201d 34, of Linden, New Jersey.\n\nThese two defendants also were arrested on July 22 by FBI agents.\n\nCourt documents outlined a dispute among members of the syndicate, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud.\n\nAfter this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by DCP Abba Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Kyari, a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police, was alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\nKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nAnifowoshe, Fashola and Agbabiaka were arrested in New York and New Jersey on July 22, and were expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles in August. The all three are currently free on bond.\n\nThe court maintained, however, that the indictment \u201ccontain allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cBoth conspiracy counts alleged in the indictment carry a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory two-year prison term.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is investigating this matter as part of Operation Top Dog. The FBI thanks the government of the United Arab Emirates and the Dubai Police Department for their substantial assistance in this matter.\n\n\u201cThe FBI also thanks the Kenyan Office of Attorney General, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Directorate of Criminal Investigations for their substantial assistance.\n\n\u201cThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter\u201d, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari has denied the allegations in a statement posted on his verified Facebook page.\n\nKyari said, \u201cAbbas, who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about two years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations, we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life and they are longtime friends, who have money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened. Later, he saw some of my native clothes and Caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe native clothes and caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and he (Hushpuppi) sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect, when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted\u201d, he said.\n\nKyari therefore maintained that there was no such transaction between him and Hushpuppi.\n\n\u201cFor those, who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious big money, they will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of service for two decades is open for everybody to see. They will continue seeing us serving our fatherland and we will continue responding to all distress calls from all Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\n\n\u201cFor good Nigerians, who appreciate our service, please, don\u2019t worry as our hands are clean and they should please not respond to those celebrating and creating many false narratives without any evidence. We are used to such types of people and false newsmakers and distributors\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has demanded a forensic investigation into reports that FBI has linked head of IGP Intelligence Response Team, Kyari, to international fraudster, Abbas.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP claimed the revelation of the involvement of Kyari, the head of Nigeria\u2019s intelligence response unit, as a receiver of proceeds of international fraud was worrisome, disturbing and a stain on the integrity of the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed disquieting that the integrity of our nation has fallen so abysmally low under the corrupt and fraud-patronizing President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, to the extent that the head of its police intelligence unit is being charged in connection with international fraud.\n\n\u201cOur party demands that the APC administration should not sweep this matter under the carpet given the manifest rapport between Kyari and some top APC leaders. We urge President Buhari not to \u2018ease out\u2019 this case of corruption but should immediately restore the integrity and image of our nation by allowing for a forensic investigation on the suspect,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nThe PDP, however, warned that, \u201cif this Abba Kyari matter is not well handled, it will be a permanent stain on the reputation of our police, security system and our nation at large.\n\nIt, therefore, asked President Buhari to direct the Inspector General of Police to take in Kyari for questioning and if found culpable, should be handed over to the FBI.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Apex bank to refund pending licensing fees to BDC promoters\n\n*Says no going back on ban of FX sale to BDCs\n\n*Bureau de Change operators: we are still in business\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja, Nume Ekeghe and Ugo Aliogo in Lagos\n\nThe naira appreciated to N520 to a dollar on the parallel market on Thursday, stronger than the N525 to a dollar it closed the previous day. The appreciation came as Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of banks promised to support the new foreign exchange (FX) measures of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the regulator\u2019s effort to achieve FX stability.\n\nOn the Investors and Exporters\u2019 (I & E) FX window, the naira closed at N411.67 to a dollar yesterday.\n\nCBN also said it will commence the refund of capital deposits and licencing fees, where applicable, to Bureau De Change (BDC) promoters who had pending licence applications before Tuesday\u2019s announcement of the end of FX sale to the currency dealers.\n\nThe apex bank insisted it would not rescind the ban on FX sale to BDCs. Director, Monetary Policy Department, CBN, Dr. Hassan Mahmud, said this yesterday when he featured on \u201cArise Xchange,\u201d a programme monitored on Arise News Channel, a THISDAY sister broadcast station.\n\nMeanwhile, President, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, reacted yesterday to the CBN\u2019s policy announcement. Gwadabe said the association would engage with the banking sector regulator to address and resolve all the issues that led to the ban on FX sale to its members.\n\nCBN Governor Godwin Emefiele had disclosed the end of FX sale to BDCs while briefing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja on Tuesday. He directed all commercial banks to immediately create designated branches for the sale and disposal of FX to eligible customers for legitimate purposes. He also said the CBN will no longer process or issue new licences for BDC operations in the country, adding that all licences being currently processed, regardless of the stage, had been suspended.\n\nThe CBN governor said the bank would now channel weekly FX allocations, hitherto meant for BDCs, to commercial banks.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a virtual media briefing, Chairman, Body of Bank CEOs, Herbert Wigwe, said authorised financial institutions in the FX market would ensure full compliance with the CBN directives in order to ensure FX stability. Wigwe said customers could walk into their banks to purchase dollars for legitimate transactions. He noted that the banks had agreed that the process would start immediately following a meeting with the CBN.\n\nWigwe, who is also Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, said the banks were ready to meet the mandate of the CBN, adding that they have more than enough capacity to deliver. He explained that the process would be centralised to avoid abuse.\n\nThe Access Bank GMD pledged that the banks would ensure that the measures that had been put in place were not disrupted and abused, saying, \u201cWe will also be doing verification of the Bank Verification Number (BVN).\u201d\n\nIn addition, Wigwe said banks yet to adhere to the mandate by the regulator to create a forex desk would be sanctioned.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe banking industry is willing and ready to carry out this function. As you are aware, the bank has very strict compliance measures in terms of Know Your Customer (KYC). For us at Access Bank, we will ensure that all our branches meet the requirements.\n\n\u201cIf you look at all the banks, you would agree with me that the banks have more than enough capacity to deal with the mandate of the CBN. \u201cIf we see non-compliance issues, we will report to the CBN and the law enforcement agencies. So if people intend to do things, such as coming with a second passport and other things, we will report them to the law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe feel that what the CBN has done is worthy of commendation because people will have access to different channels to collect their BTAs and school fees required for their children.\n\n\u201cThe banks have a lot more channels to assist the customers get access to forex, depending on where they are, even if they are in Enugu or Port Harcourt.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Chief Executive Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank, Segun Agbaje, expressed the readiness of the bank to begin implementation of the mandate given by the CBN. Agbaje assured customers that the banks had the resources to fund the process, adding that they have collectively agreed to start immediately.\n\nHe also stated that different banks had different processes, therefore, banks should examine their controls, and what worked for them.\n\nAgbaje said, \u201cThere is a lot of abuse around FX, so you will find out that some of the better controlled systems are centralised, while some are decentralised. Customers should not panic, there would be availability of forex, and the banks will run a very transparent process.\u201d\n\nCBN to Refund Pending Licencing Fees to BDC Promoters\n\nCBN said it would immediately commence the refund of capital deposits and licencing fees, where applicable, to BDC promoters who had pending license applications with the bank. CBN in a circular to BDC promoters and all banks, dated July 29, 2021, and signed by the CBN Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department, Mr. Ibrahim Tukur, advised the affected promoters to forward their requests for refund in writing to the Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department.\n\nIt added that the requests should be accompanied with telex copy of initial deposit of N35 million and account details of the refund, which should be the same as the account from which the capital deposited originated, including bank name, account name and number, as well as copy of the bank draft/telex for payment of licensing fee of N1 million, if any.\n\nCBN further directed all deposit money banks to henceforth stop accepting instructions from customers to transfer capital deposits of N35 million to the designated CBN account for the purpose of applying for BDC licenses.\n\nSimilarly, the banking sector regulator, in another circular, directed all banks to set up teller points at designated branches across the country to fulfil legitimate FX requests for Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Business Travel Allowance (BTA), tuition fees, medical payments, and SMEs transactions, among others.\n\nIn the letter to all banks, signed by the Director, Banking Supervision Department, Mr. Haruna Mustafa, the bank explained that the directive was part of the fallouts of the MPC meeting, which had also authorised the commercial banks to begin accepting cash deposits of foreign exchange from their customers. The circular directed the banks to adequately publicise the locations of designated branches and make necessary arrangements to sell FX to customers in cash and/or electronically in compliance with extant regulations.\n\nCBN strongly advised banks to ensure that no customer was turned back or refused FX, provided documentation and all other requirements were satisfied.\n\nThe apex bank further warned against undue delays, rationing and diversion of FX, and directed commercial banks to establish electronic applications and alert systems to update customers on the status of their FX requests. It reminded banks that a toll-free line had been set up at the apex bank to enable bank customers to escalate unresolved complaints related to their FX requests.\n\nThe statement added that the CBN would continue to closely monitor banks\u2019 conduct and compliance with the directive in order to ensure an efficient FX market for all legitimate users, adding that any breach of the directive will be severely sanctioned.\n\nABCON to Engage CBN\n\nPresident, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, yesterday said the association would engage the CBN to address the ban on FX sale to its members. Gwadabe said the planned engagement would, among other things, seek to identify and sanction earring BDCs.\n\nIn a statement, he clarified that the association was still providing FX services, in spite of the central bank\u2019s action.\n\nGwadabe said the pronouncement by the CBN did not stop BDCs from providing FX services as allowed by their operating licences and in their operating guidelines.\n\nGwadabe said, \u201cBDCs are licenced to provide retail FX services, including buying from the public and also selling to end-users for allowable transactions, namely, PTA, BTA, payment of medical, and school fees.\u201d\n\nHe said while the CBN had stopped dollar sale to BDCs, it did not cancelled their operating licences, or ban them from providing FX services to members of the public.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the dollar sale from CBN had helped in enhancing supply, the fact remains that BDCs are empowered to source FX from other sources and also to provide various services to members of the public.\n\n\u201cAt ABCON, we urge our members to see the CBN pronouncement as a wakeup call and opportunity to widen their customer base and deepen their business.\n\n\u201cABCON has always worked with the CBN to ensure proper working of the FX market and in line with this principle, we will engage with the apex bank to address and resolve all the issues that led to the recent action, including identification and sanctioning of earring BDCs, where necessary.\u201d\n\nCBN: There\u2019s No Going Back on Ban of FX Sale to BDCs\n\nContrary to insinuations that the CBN may withdraw its decision to end FX sale to BDCs, the regulator yesterday stressed that there was no going back on the matter. Director, Monetary Policy Department, CBN, Dr. Hassan Mahmud, said this on \u201cArise Xchange,\u201d a programme monitored on Arise News Channel.\n\nMahmud said unlike the temporary ban of FX sale to BDCs in 2016, the central bank was taking a tougher stand this time. He said going forward, the bank would only supply the greenback to banks to meet genuine retail needs of Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis time around, there is going to be stricter monitoring and the banks themselves know what is on their shoulders now, looking at where we are coming from in terms of taking it off the BDC segment because of distortion and irregularities and arbitrages we saw in that market.\n\n\u201cSo, the banks know that this is a more serious burden on them and it is something that has to do with their reputation and the fact that the CBN has enough tools within its purview to monitor those banks and also penalise those that fall off the line.\u201d\n\nMahmud stated, \u201cFrom the language the governor spoke for now, it is permanent. It is not a stopgap that after one month we would come to reverse. Even the BDCs applications that are under process, all that is going to stop and all funding of FX requirement should go to the commercial banks.\u201d\n\nHe added that the policy would help curb arbitrage related to FX malpractices and improve transparency in the market.\n\nMahmud explained, \u201cOne big area that was a major issue is the behaviour in the BDC market. We got to a stage that you could not differentiate between the BDC market rate and the parallel market rate, whereas BDCs are supposed to be formal institutions licenced by the central bank with a licencing guideline with what to do.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be the retail end to moderate prices at that level because of the shocks. We always regard that market as very little and insignificant so it is not going to really impact on the other parameters of the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cWith time, we have come to see a lot of noise in that market and that has generated a lot of issues around the transparency and conduct of that market. There was a need for the CBN to come in to put things in perspective and allow the market system to operate in a very efficient manner.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Nigeria\u2019s central bank is banning forex sales to money changers",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It had also gotten a $100m investment from Mastercard in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) in April.\n\nAMC BV is a subsidiary of Airtel Africa that functions as the holding company for several of the company\u2019s mobile money operations across 14 African countries.\n\nThe mobile money division is one of the largest financial services providers on the continent. It enables users to make mobile payments, international money transfers, borrow money, and use virtual credit cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, the investment will be used to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.\n\nThe investment deal will be completed in two tranches, with the first $150m probably in August and $50m at a yet unspecified date.\n\nAirtel Africa says that QIA will hold a minority stake in the company while it retains the majority.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the job of a system administrator \u2014 sometimes called a sysadmin or system admin \u2014 had begun to fascinate me. But before we start, a little back story.\n\nMy first experience with system administrators was with the technical support staff in the ICTU/CRPU unit of the University of Benin. Depending on the mood you catch them in, you could get a good-natured, friendly personality or, a trash-talking grump \u2014 most likely the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2021, my job at Techpoint Africa led me to meet people like Karo, a soft-spoken but highly opinionated sysadmin who takes his job seriously and, quite frankly, knows what he is doing.\n\nThe difference was stark, but I still didn\u2019t know what exactly sysadmins did. And I decided to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are System Administrators?\n\nWhen I first began down the rabbit hole called research, I expected to find a pretty complex maze of confusing terms and techy words. In the end, I did find them \u2014 words like awk, Perl, and shell. I also found semi-familiar words like server, network, and information.\n\nBut I discovered an underlying thread, troubleshooting. At the heart of the job of a system administrator is the ability to find solutions to the IT fires an organisation dependent on technology inevitably needs to put out.\n\nKolade Alonge, a former server administrator at MultiChoice, puts it succinctly, \u201cWe are problem solvers.\u201d\n\nMore than that, System Administrators are responsible for the general management and maintenance of computer systems \u2014 servers, storage, CPU, PC \u2014 including software and hardware.\n\nThey manage user accounts, server configurations, install, configure and update software. Essentially, they keep an organisation from falling apart. System Administrators troubleshoot all day, every day.\n\nFor the average sysadmin, the day is spent attending to tickets \u2014 troubleshooting requests \u2014 from users, checking for errors and making sure the server is running perfectly.\n\nIt is quite demanding, requiring sysadmins to have knowledge of computer architecture \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 and stay abreast of the latest updates to software; constantly think widely for economical solutions for the organisation while trying to maintain some semblance of calm.\n\nThe path to System Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fatosa Adigun, his journey began in the four walls of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, as a student in the Electrical/Electronics Engineering Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started as an intern after my national diploma. Even though I was studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I was privileged to do my industrial training in an IT firm somewhere in Ikeja. I was posted to the Network and IT Department. I knew I\u2019d end up in the IT field.\u201d\n\nHis love for IT led him to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science, a programme which will end next year.\n\nAlonge\u2019s path was a different one. He studied Computer Science as an undergraduate and began his career as an IT Auditor, but eventually wound up as a System Administrator at Multichoice for the better part of a year. An experience he believes every IT professional should have.\n\n\u201cEvery auditor needs to have that experience of providing service before auditing service.\u201d\n\nAlonge and Adigun agree on one thing, going to university barely gives you 10% of the knowledge you need on the job. Many skills they acquired were primarily learnt as they went along or via courses and certifications they have had to take.\n\nAccording to Alonge, in Nigeria, school will teach you what you need to understand about computer architecture. If you are lucky enough, you get a lecturer good at programming who teaches well.\n\nWhile entry requirements for system administrators are relatively low, companies often prefer to hire persons with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a computer-related course such as computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, or telecommunications and networking.\n\nHowever, according to Olusegun Balogun, an IT Support Specialist, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have those degrees to become a system administrator.\n\n\u201cAt Southgate Technologies, where I did my IT, I had a boss then. He was a subject matter expert in networking, but his first degree was in sociology. It depends first of all on the passion you have for computers, or it could be the first job you landed, and you decided to build a career in IT.\u201d\n\nReal-life experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonge recalls receiving a call from his office informing him that his server room was on fire. Thankfully, this was not the case. The problem was with the cooling equipment. The room was quite hot, and the servers had to be turned off to prevent downtime.\n\nHeat is a sworn nemesis of servers. The ideal temperature for a server room is between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius. You also have to be careful not to keep the server room too cold \u2014 very dicey.\n\nApart from the health of the servers, what concerned him most was the fact that fellow staff members would be unable to work.\n\nHe recalls another incident; the backup solution was not working for the file server \u2014 where organisations store their documents and important information. He would have to update the hard drive, a tricky situation that meant that if he failed, not only would important information be lost, he could lose his job as well.\n\nEventually, everything went off without a hitch, with some prayer backing it along the way. He counts this as both his best and worst experience on the job.\n\nFor System Administrators, a problem solved is a highlight of their day. Adigun\u2019s best experience involved solving a network issue for a very important client, a government parastatal which shall not be named.\n\nHis worst experience was a bad boss at a former workplace. His superior shouted at him for a mistake he had inadvertently committed.\n\nHow important are System Administrators?\n\nAccording to Balogun, as long as an organisation\u2019s system depends on IT infrastructure, sysadmins are important. But he also says it depends on the size of the organisation\n\n\u201cSome organisations have in-house administrators because they can afford to hire them. But there are some organisations that cannot afford to keep those engineers in-house, so they just outsource those roles to big organisations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all organisations, as long as you have some IT setup, routers, switches, LAN, some servers, definitely you will need a system administrator for maintenance. It now depends on the size of the organisation to know whether you are going to outsource or not,\u201d he concludes\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer GFI Software \u2014 a business-IT essential software provider \u2014 IT admins rarely have enough time, find it challenging to work without impacting users, keep everything running smoothly, and find users unpredictable.\n\nThat post was made in 2014, and if Adigun\u2019s statements are factual, it remains the norm. For him, the job is quite time-consuming. Sometimes, he has had to leave the office at 10 p.m. He also finds dealing with users in other departments stressful and keeping up with updates to the software.\n\nAlonge identifies scenarios where an organisation wastes money to get gadgets that might not be needed or repair systems that can be repaired with a bit of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the gadgets; it\u2019s about the knowledge,\u201d he says.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAs is the natural progression of things, technology has evolved over the years. Many jobs now involve a lot more automation than they did in the last 10, 20 years.\n\nCan AI take over the job of a sysadmin? Experts disagree, at the very least not until AI does not need the input or guidance of a human being.\n\nA Medium post by mindsync explains this quite well, \u201cIn order to use the algorithms effectively, you need the talent of a living person (it\u2019s not enough to just teach the algorithm on a sample, you need to understand the business context, data features, and be able to interpret the results correctly).\u201d\n\nBoth Adigun and Alonge agree with this assessment\n\nSystems Administrators Appreciation Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you are probably wondering. Why are we talking about sysadmins?\n\nToday, Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. Ted Kekatos created it.\n\nKekatos was inspired by an HP magazine ad in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers \u2014 the same model he had just installed at his workplace.\n\nIt is a day created specifically to appreciate the tireless and sometimes thankless job that sysadmins do, 24 hours a day, 365 \u2014 or six \u2014 a year.\n\nOn the website, it says: \u201cProper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to): cake & ice cream, pizza, cards, gifts, words of gratitude, custom t-shirts celebrating the epic greatness of your SysAdmin, balloons, confetti, did I say gifts?\u201d\n\nSo, to all sysadmins, up at 3 a.m. trying to work out a server downtime issue, or racking your brains, trying to find the answer to a firewall problem, we say thank you.\n\nAnd most of all, we say a big thank you to Muyiwa Matuluko, Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant and Ognenekaro Obrutu, former Technical Product Lead, for putting out our IT fires \u2014 which we may or may not cause ourselves.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are all LoftyInc Capital Management (LCM) portfolio companies, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom inception to commercialisation, LCM claims to leverage global partnerships and standards to ensure that investments are impact-driven. LCM says it applies technological innovations to Africa\u2019s most pressing problems with skilled indigenous and returning world-class African teams.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, the firm partnered with the Africa Leadership Forum to launch Wennovation hub to provide technology support to Africa\u2019s social impact sectors.\n\nHow does LoftyInc get deals? Bello revealed that there are five major sources of deals for the firm. With a strong network at home and in the diaspora, the firm gets access to startups building amazing startups.\n\nHe also disclosed that founders who have been funded frequently refer other founders to them.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Idris Ayodeji Bello, a Managing Partner at the firm to get an insight into the firm\u2019s activities.

Although dyslexia may co-occur with eye and vision conditions, these conditions are unrelated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability. Per the International Dyslexia Association, it is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language, dyslexia impacts reading comprehension and fluency, writing, memory, listening, and executive functioning in the workplace or school.\n\nBesides, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nHence, the need to adopt tech tools to help them perform better. Last month, we discussed how assistive technology helps people with learning disabilities to unleash their potential.\n\nThis is an excellent time to revisit it: The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology.\n\nMany assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events, but we highlighted four tools that help them succeed academically and professionally.

Google has announced a new policy update on the Android Play Store to support user control, privacy, and security, beginning September 1, 2021.\n\nThe new update prohibits apps focused on \u201ccompensated sexual relationships.\u201d \u201cSugar dating\u201d apps will no longer be allowed on the Android Play Store as part of a series of platform policy changes.\n\nIs the old policy similar? Before announcing the update, Google\u2019s Play Store policies already prohibited apps promoting \u201cservices that could be interpreted as providing sexual acts for a fee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the updated policy includes \u201ccompensated dating or sexual arrangements in which one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts, or financial support to another participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Google didn\u2019t announce why the apps are being prohibited on its Store, there has been a significant rise in efforts to prevent sex work in the United States.\n\nSince implementing the FOSTA-SESTA legislation in 2018, the protections granted to online content for the promotion or facilitation of prostitution have been revoked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the new update, Google is providing a Developer Preview of app set ID for critical use cases like analytics and fraud prevention. Also, the search giant is adding new restrictions to its Family Policy which is aimed at children.\n\nIt is also adding a new section to its Enforcement Policy that will allow it to close inactive or abandoned developer accounts after one year of inactivity, among other things.\n\nGoogle claims that with its User Data Policy update, it will be illegal to link persistent device identifiers to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers unless for pre-approved use cases.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Gave Investors 10.4 Billion Reasons To Be Happy\u2014But Its Stock Sank Anyways.

You recall that I said I am going to probe that contract, but wanted to convince myself that it was not a case of witch-hunt.\n\n\u201cBut just coming here today to see the extent of work done, it\u2019s clear that the contract under the Benin Stormwater Master Plan is not what it is and Edo people need to know how their money was spent: the project has not been completed 10 years after.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to note is that the job cannot be completed without taking care of the drainage, as water destroys roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to subject this to thorough analysis and investigation, to enable us to recover taxpayers\u2019 money wrongfully taken out of our treasury,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cAt Evbareke Market, there is supposed to be a road and drainage. But 10 years after, nothing has happened. I promised the people in the area, during my electioneering campaign, that I am going to build the road, but I wanted to make sure that we are not spending money on projects that they have claimed to have completed.\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the pace of work by the contractor. You are standing on very huge underground drainage and it has been covered, as you will not know that there is an extensive drainage under it. They would have gone faster, but for the rain.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ferguson Enabulele, said the government plans to achieve about an 8km stretch of the entire length of Ekehuan Road before the end of the year.\n\n...",

          "text": "BEDC Electricity Plc (BEDC), has decried the rising cases of vandalism across its franchise zone which it says aside being an economic crime is an act of sabotage against the good purpose and intents of the company, canvassing that the effects of vandalism should stimulate tougher laws to be enforced to protect public property, especially electricity infrastructure.\n\nThis information was made available by the company in a press statement signed by the Head, Corporate Affairs, Mr Adekunle Tayo, where he appealed to members of the public on the need to be vigilant and security conscious on the activities of some unruly elements in the society whose aim is to make life unbearable for them through their nefarious acts.\n\nAccording to BEDC, the power sector has been the most hit in the most devastating manner and the effect of vandalism cannot be over emphasized as residential customers, industries, small and medium scale businesses are being starved of power as a result of the activities of vandals.\n\n\u2018\u2019The recent surge in cases of vandalism within our franchise area calls for greater attention. More worrisome is the fact that these miscreants are continuously innovating new ideas beyond human comprehension to perpetrate their criminal acts. We see the recent vandalism of 14 spans of electricity conductors in Ilu-titun, Southern Ondo state, on a line currently being rehabilitated by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) as very disturbing. More disturbing is the fact that Okitipupa town was recently thrown into blackout as a result of the vandalism of 20 spans of electricity conductors which occurred between Ode-Aye and Okitipupa. As a company, we see these as acts of economic sabotage against the good intents of BEDC,\u201d he remarked.\n\nAccording to Mr Tayo, BEDC regrets the situation whereby the money that could have been judiciously invested on network upgrade such as energisation of new transformers or construction of new lines to relief existing ones would now be channelled towards replacing the vandalised items. It is indeed unfortunate that revenue that could be used for critical development projects are being used to restore damaged and stolen equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are however not relenting in our quest to overcome this societal issue through improved community relations drive of involving all stakeholders at the grassroots aside ensuring that our facilities are well secured in our bid to arrest this ugly trend,\u201d the statement added.\n\nVandalism of electricity distribution network and other forms of electrical thefts are serious threats to power sector sustainability and economic growth and have been major acts negatively affecting service delivery to customers.\n\nEfforts by BEDC at curbing the menace of vandalism on its network had received a boost with the sentencing of one David James to three years imprisonment by a Benin Magistrate Court 6 in Egor Local Government area of Edo state recently.\n\nOn 3rd July 2021, a 2.5MVA, 33/11KV Injection Substation at Igarra near Auchi, in Edo state was vandalized while RUM, upriser cables, incomer cables etc. were removed by the vandals.\n\nHowever, luck ran out of the vandals as they were arrested by the Police Division at Ogorimagogo in Kogi State and the stolen items were recovered. The arrested suspects were later transferred to SCID Lokoja, while efforts are being made by the Edo State Police Command to retrieve the arrested suspects and exhibits to Edo State where they will be charged to court at the end of Police investigation.\n\nOnly last week there was a reported case of high-tension cable conductor vandalism at Esaba, Otutuaima, Oghangbla and Iuhre-Ogun communities in Ughelli South Local Government area of Delta State.

          "title": "Osun PDP: The Long Walk to Justice, By Dr. Longe Oyeleye",
          "text": "On 29th Day of July 2021 the erudite Honourable Justice S.O Oke sat on the much awaited case on the controversial removal of Hon Soji Adagunodo as the Chairman of Osun PDP. The Honorable Justice in his wisdom affirmed that the ongoing appeal filed by the Adeleke group at the court of Appeal in Abuja should be exhausted before giving his judgment on the substantive suit.\n\nThe Court sitting in Osogbo was filled to capacity by supporters of Hon Soji Adagunodo and Adeleke to hear the judgment. The road leading to this point has been rough, difficult and it is obvious that the long walk to justice has not ended.\n\nThe 24 hours leading to the judgment was frenzy, the Adeleke group threw caution to the winds and railed all kinds of accusations against the judge and the judiciary. They even released a fake judgment claiming that it was written by another judge. They accused the incumbent government of attempts to hijack the PDP, all kinds of blackmails and propaganda were flying left and right all in a bid to intimidate the judiciary into submission, hold the party to ransom and delay justice.\n\nWhen the petition against the Honorable Judge failed to hold waters, they proceeded to the Court of Appeal in Abuja and made efforts to arrest the judgment. The three (3) justices who sat on the case were unanimous in their judgment that the Adeleke groups were trying to tie the hands of the judiciary and buy time to hijack the legal proceedings. The Adeleke group has never failed to let everyone know that they could procure judgment with money.\n\nDespite the venomous attacks on his person and sheer pressure up to the night before the sitting, the Honorable Justice followed legal procedures to allow the court of appeal to exhaust its process. The Adeleke Group in their sheer ignorance went into wreck jubilation, without realizing that what they got was a judicial mirage that would soon evaporate.\n\nIt was anticipated that resolving the Chairmanship tussle at the court today would have laid to rest the continued uncertainty of the participation of the party at the coming gubernatorial elections but the Adeleke group in their desperation to subvert the path of justice have just burgled the chance of the party. When the Court of Appeal resolves the issues, if it does not go to the Supreme Court, the case will return back to the lower court for adjudication and the circle to the court of appeal and supreme courts will continue. It is a long walk to justice indeed.\n\nSadly, the PRO of the Party, Hon. Sunday Bisi, who was illegally elevated to the position of the party chairman without due process in his press release accused Hon. Soji Adagunodo of conniving with the APC to wreck the PDP. It is a case of either sheer ignorance or an attempt to give the dog a bad name in order to hang it. It is very clear that it is the Adeleke Group that is trying to subvert the PDP and waste her chances at the polls. The Adeleke Group financed the faceless Rebuilders who sent petitions to the NWC of the PDP accusing him of crimes he did not commit and the NWC without any evidence sprang into action to remove an elected Chairman. It was the Adeleke Group, who forged signatures of SWC members to pass a vote of no confidence on Hon. Soji Adagunodo. It was the Adeleke Group who made a spirited attempt to steal the case file from High Court 4, Osogbo. They were the people who filed an appeal against a judgment that had not been given. We are yet to see the hands of the APC or any other group in all of this desperation to hijack the PDP.\n\nWhen the Bukola Saraki reconciliation committee was inaugurated and he met with representatives of Osun PDP, hope was raised that a political solution would be found for the crisis, but the Adelekes stopped the resolution and forbade the Saraki group from even visiting Osun State. While they made progress at resolving the crisis in Ogun and Lagos State, Osun and Ekiti was locked in the cold through the Adeleke/Fayose tango. Even the South West reconciliation committee led by Gov Olagunsoye Oyinlola was rebuffed by the Adelekes, they failed to attend any of the hearings held in Ososgbo to find a political solution to the crisis. It is sheer ineptitude on the part of Hon. Sunday Bisi or anyone for that matter to have accused the opposition (ruling party) of fueling the crisis in the PDP. The Adelekes are the culprits.\n\nMajor stakeholders had watched with keen interest how Hon. Sunday Bisi working with pathfinder, the Adeleke group within the party, to adopt Senator Ademola Adeleke as the sole candidate of the party for the gubernatorial election. This is a man who jumped bail and has been away from Osun State since 2018. It is obvious that hijacking the party is aimed at getting a consensus ticket for the runaway senator in hope that he would be able to return back to the country and enjoy immunity. It can be recalled with nostalgia several failed announcements of his return and distribution of Ankara to their supporters for his coming during the Ileya holidays. The Adeleke group are either too blind or they are half clever. The APC Government understands the game much more than they give them credit.\n\nAs the debacle hangs on the neck of the PDP, Hon Soji Adagunodo is advised to continue to pursue justice if not for anything to clear his family name from the mud spilled by the Adeleke group. This is very important because every man has a right to prove his innocence not just in the court of public opinion but also in the court of justice. It is expedient to call on the leaders and well-meaning members of the PDP to rise up and take their party from the hands of the usurpers. Head or tail, the Osun PDP is in deep shit!\n\nThis shall be a long walk to justice.\n\nDr Longe Oyeleye,\n\nPDP, writes from Dallas, Texas.",

If we decide to put it in the public, some may say it is the confirmation that I don\u2019t like Muslims,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cMy Special Assistant on Islamic Affairs has said most of the things meant to be said. But one thing he didn\u2019t remember to say is that the Imam of Omituntun has been there since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe started building the Omituntun Mosque structure in 2013 and we completed it in 2014. As of that time, those who were my closest aides were three and they are all Muslims.\n\n\u201cI want to say it again that I love both the Muslims and the Christians as well as the traditionalists. We must not discriminate and we have to be fair to everybody. And we believe that whatever we do, we will get the reward from God.\n\n\u201cWe are serving you as your servants. I came to you to give us the opportunity to serve you and you did. So, I believe we must serve you with the fear of God.\n\n\u201cSo, today, I want to fulfill part of the promises I made before I got elected as the governor of Oyo State. I promised that, when I become the governor, I would do my best to support people from both religions. That is why I want to donate a bus each to the Ansar-Ud-Deen of Oyo State and that of Oyo Town, to propagate the gospel of Islam.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking during the presentation of the buses, a former Speaker of the Oyo State House of Assembly and senator who represented Oyo Central between 2015 and 2019, Senator Monsurat Sunmonu, who is also member of the Ansar-Ud-Deen Society, commended Governor Makinde for running an all-inclusive government.\n\nShe maintained that as a part of the ooalition of parties that brought the government into power, she has been giving support to the government because it is doing things right, calling for prayers for the governor and the government.\n\nShe said: \u201cYou all know that I was once a Speaker in this state and Senator that represented Oyo Central Senatorial District. So, I can understand what is called governance. We are looking round to gather people within Oyo State for us to be able to support the Governor Makinde-led administration to succeed.\n\n\u201cIn doing this, the governor deemed it fit to get us a vehicle for movement, not for politics but for the course of their duties. As Muslims, they will be moving round to mosques and everywhere to propagate the Islamic religion.\n\n\u201cAlso, for FIBAN, they are part of the constituency of the governor.

So, we thank him and all the good people of Oyo State.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing politics of \u2018pulling someone down by all means\u2019 but whenever we see something being done in the right manner, we are bound to give support.\u201d\n\nChairman of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society, Alhaji Babatunde Oladejo expressed happiness with the donation, stating that it will help in its programmes to enlighten people on Islam and \u201cprobably the development in the government circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said during my sermon, Oyo State is a technical place to govern but the governor has been trying and all we need to do is to keep assisting him with prayers. We should also try as much as possible to let the people know the good works he is doing in the state.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Oyo State chapter of FIBAN, Pastor Seun Akindele, also expressed gratitude to the governor for the donation, stating that it was a surprise to the body.",

When the governor met them, they requested for vehicle and they came through me to collect it. So, we thank him and all the good people of Oyo State.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing politics of \u2018pulling someone down by all means\u2019 but whenever we see something being done in the right manner, we are bound to give support.\u201d\n\nChairman of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society, Alhaji Babatunde Oladejo expressed happiness with the donation, stating that it will help in its programmes to enlighten people on Islam and \u201cprobably the development in the government circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said during my sermon, Oyo State is a technical place to govern but the governor has been trying and all we need to do is to keep assisting him with prayers. We should also try as much as possible to let the people know the good works he is doing in the state.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Oyo State chapter of FIBAN, Pastor Seun Akindele, also expressed gratitude to the governor for the donation, stating that it was a surprise to the body.",
          "summary": "Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde of Oyo State declared on Friday that some persons who are fond of accusing him of hating Islam or religious favoritism are individuals with skeletons in their cupboards.\n\u201cSo, today, I want to fulfill part of the promises I made before I got elected as the governor of Oyo State.\nShe said: \u201cYou all know that I was once a Speaker in this state and Senator that represented Oyo Central Senatorial District.\nWe are looking round to gather people within Oyo State for us to be able to support the Governor Makinde-led administration to succeed.\nSo, we thank him and all the good people of Oyo State.",

The Bank grew bottom-line by 34% as Profit before Tax (PBT) moved up significantly in positive territory to close at N1.50 billion from N1.12 billion recorded in H2 2020.\n\nSimilarly, the Profit After Tax, PAT closed at N1.38 billion within the period under review from N1.03 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020, a sign of a stronger recovery in the overall economy and the Bank\u2019s key focus market segment after a disruptive pandemic year.\n\nA major highlight of the result is the growth in the Bank\u2019s loan book, which saw a 22% increase to N246.90 billion within the period compared to N202.08 billion recorded in H2 2020.\n\nThe lender also sustained growth trajectory in its assets as total assets for the period rose by 11% to N547.37 billion from N492.02 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nOther highlights of the financial statement include a 21% jump in fee and commission income to N3.07 billion from N2.54 billion in the corresponding period of 2020; and N9.87 billion upticks in net interest incomes, representing a 9% increase from the N9.06 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nInterest and similar income also rose though recording a marginal 2% growth to close at N20.27 billion compared to the N19.79 billion recorded in half-year 2020. Earnings per share rose by 3 kobo to close at 11.82 Kobo within the period compared to 8.82 Kobo recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nThe financial report also contained the details of the three months to June 2021 (Q2 2021) report showed that the Bank recorded a 17% leap in gross income to N12.32 billion from N10.50 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020.\n\nPre-tax profit for the period closed at N718.0 million, a 31% increased from N546.35 million recorded in Q2 2020, while Profit After Tax equally closed at N660.57 million from N502.65 million recorded in the corresponding review period.\n\nCommenting on the result, the Managing Director/CEO, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun noted encouraging trends in key performance indicators driving the numbers reported in the H1 result, in that the Bank is beginning to reflect greater consistency, steady outlook and resilience that places it on a performance pedestal ahead of the volatilities in the operating environment occasioned partly by the prevailing global pandemic and other market shocks that have far-reaching implications in the local and foreign economies.\n\nThe double digits growth recorded in both earnings and profits, she further added, was the result of a portfolio plan which the Bank set out in the beginning of the year to diversify its portfolio whilst incrementally pursuing asset creation in petrochemical downstream, consumer, healthcare and general commerce with agribusiness providing the bulwark for identified business and brand benefits.\n\nShe stated that the Bank will be looking to strengthen its balance sheet from the liability side as it continues to grow its brand franchise in many areas of the retail market by promoting and leveraging its Agriculture value chain businesses as an offshoot to achieve better performance ratios that enable it expand the scope of business for even greater outcome.\n\nAnalysts share the optimism on the growth trajectory achieved on the back of contributions from diverse portfolio investments which is a radical departure from the past.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By Cecilia Ologunagba\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) have classified northern Nigeria and 22 other countries as \u2018hunger hotspots\u2019.\n\nIn the next four months, conflict, COVID-19 and the climate crisis are likely to increase hunger in those countries, according to WFP/FAO.\n\nMs Eri Kaneko, the associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said this while briefing correspondents at the UN headquarters on Friday in New York.\n\nKaneko said Ethiopia and Madagascar were the world\u2019s newest \u201chighest alert\u201d hunger hotspots, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe highest alert list also includes South Sudan, Yemen, and northern Nigeria. In some areas of these countries, significant numbers of people are at risk of falling into famine.\n\n\u201cThe report flags other countries where life-threatening hunger is on the rise.\n\n\u201cThey include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Honduras, Sudan, and Syria,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAccording to her, WFP and FAO have said humanitarian action is urgently needed to prevent hunger, famine and death in all 23 hotspots.\n\nIn a statement, the UN agencies warned that efforts to fight a global surge in acute food insecurity were being stymied in several countries by fighting and blockades that cut off life-saving aid to families on the brink of famine.\n\n\u201cBureaucratic obstacles, as well as a lack of funding, also hamper the two UN agencies\u2019 efforts to provide emergency food assistance and enable farmers to plant at scale and at the right time.\n\n\u201cThis is of grave concern as conflict, the economic repercussions of COVID-19 and the climate crisis are expected to drive higher levels of acute food insecurity in 23 hunger hotspots over the next four months.,\u2019\u2019 it stated.\n\nFAO and WFP have already warned that 41 million people were at risk of falling into famine unless they received immediate food and livelihood assistance.\n\n\u201c2020 saw 155 million people facing acute food insecurity at Crisis or worse levels in 55 countries, and according to the Global Report on Food Crises, an increase of more than 20 million from 2019 \u2013 and the trend is only expected to worsen this year.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of those on the verge are farmers. Alongside food assistance, we must do all we can to help them resume food production themselves so that families and communities can move back towards self-sufficiency and not just depend on aid to survive,\u201d said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult without access, and without adequate funding \u2013 and so far, support to agriculture as key means of preventing widespread famine remains largely overlooked by donors, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cWithout such support to agriculture, humanitarian needs will keep skyrocketing, that\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\u201cFamilies that rely on humanitarian assistance to survive are hanging by a thread. When we cannot reach them that thread is cut, and the consequences are nothing short of catastrophic,\u201d warned David Beasley, WFP Executive Director.\n\nThe report highlights that conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks \u2013 often related to the economic fallout of COVID-19 \u2013 will likely remain primary drivers of acute food insecurity for the August-November 2021 period.\n\nIt said transboundary threats was an aggravating factor in some regions, in particular, desert locust infestations in the Horn of Africa and African migratory locust in Southern Africa require continued monitoring and vigilance.\n\nIt said humanitarian access constraints was another severe aggravating factor that hampers efforts to curb food crises and prevent starvation, death and a total collapse of livelihoods, increasing the risk of famine.\n\n\u201cCountries currently facing most significant obstacles preventing aid from reaching those who need it most include Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, Mali, Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe road to Zero Hunger isn\u2019t paved with conflict, checkpoints and red tape.\n\n\u201cHumanitarian access isn\u2019t some abstract concept \u2013 it means authorities approving paperwork in time so that food can be moved swiftly.\n\n\u201cIt means checkpoints allow trucks to pass and reach their destination, it means humanitarian responders are not targeted, so they are able to carry out their life- and livelihood-saving work,\u201d Beasley said.\n\nNAN",

          "text": "Janet Banana, the widow of Zimbabwe\u2019s first president Canaan Banana has died at the aged of 83, her family announced.\n\nShe died at Bulawayo\u2019s Mater Dei Hospital from a kidney ailment, according to her niece Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga.\n\n\u201cShe has been battling a kidney ailment for quite some time. She went into the hospital on July 19 and unfortunately we have lost her,\u201d said Misihairabwi-Mushonga.\n\nBorn Janet Mbuyazwe in 1938, she trained as a teacher and it was while working at a school that she met a fellow teacher, Canaan Banana. The couple married in 1961. He trained as a minister at a local theological college and by the time their first son was born, the family was moving from post to post in service with the Methodist ministry.\n\nBut the wind of change was already blowing through Africa as the continent sought to shake off European colonial rule.\n\nAs the independence movement in Rhodesia gained momentum, Canaan became involved in politics, becoming the vice president of the African National Council, a group outlawed by the Ian Smith colonial regime.\n\nAs ANC members were arrested and thrown into prison, the net began to close around Banana.\n\nHe fled to the United States where Janet and their children joined him.\n\nThe family returned to Rhodesia in 1975 with the war still raging.\n\nBanana was arrested on arrival in Salisbury, now Harare.\n\nHe was finally released after the Lancaster House talks in London, in 1979, which reached an agreement on a new constitution for the country.\n\nAt Zimbabwe\u2019s independence in 1980, Canaan became the country\u2019s president, a largely ceremonial position until a constitutional amendment abolished the post in 1987.\n\nRobert Mugabe, who had been prime minister, became executive president.\n\nThe family endured turmoil when, in 1997, Canaan was arrested and accused of sodomy. The accusations were made during the murder trial of his former bodyguard, Jefta Dube. Dube, a police officer, had shot dead Patrick Mashiri, an officer who had taunted him about being \u201cBanana\u2019s homosexual wife\u201d.\n\nThe allegations did not surprise Janet, however. She told The Guardian in 2002: \u201cBefore we moved out of the State House, my husband\u2019s bodyguard gave me some startling news. He told me, \u2018Canaan is gay.\u2019 I was shocked.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I questioned myself: why, why? Eventually, after searching my soul I began to think, it\u2019s his life \u2013 maybe I should accept it.\u201d\n\nCanaan, who fled to South Africa while out on bail before being persuaded to return, served a six-month sentence in an open prison.\n\nThe Bananas continued living together, however, and the issue of Canaan\u2019s homosexuality was kept out of the public eye.\n\nIn October 2000, friends of Janet in London suggested that she go to Britain for a break.\n\n\u201cOnce I was on the plane, I went through all the recent events of my life in my head. I was coming for a holiday, but on reflection, I decided there was no life for me in Zimbabwe,\u201d she said in a 2002 interview, admitting that she had lost touch with her husband who died a year later.\n\nJanet was awarded British citizenship in 2006.\n\nShe returned to Zimbabwe in January 2019. She was in and out of the hospital in South Africa and Zimbabwe, battling a kidney ailment.\n\nJanet had four children with the former president. Their son, Michael, died in November last year.",

He did not even stay here up to one day before he was arrested. He was arrested at the airport on his way out.\n\n\u201cSpace and time were not enough to link him with any criminal issue here. This has made it difficult to say his mission here is to cause trouble or commit a crime. He was arrested because of political issues emanating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHis continued incarceration here is to allow things to calm down and for peace to reign between Nigeria and Benin Republic. We have no criminal allegation against him in the Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cAnyone that insists that we should set Igboho free now only wants him killed. He can be killed, which may cause more problems.\n\n\u201cI have not seen him since Monday, but his wife is allowed to see him. I am processing for permission to see him. But I see his wife from time to time. We spoke about two hours ago. She said he is very safe where he is now. He was given medical attention immediately after he got to the prison.\n\n\u201cThe new place is far better than the police cell because he will no longer be in handcuffs. He enjoys full protection and comfort where he is being kept. There is an instruction that he should not be made to feel like a prisoner or criminal. He is not a convict yet.\n\n\u201cAbout the next court appearance, we have not gone back to the court because that is not how we do it here. It takes some two weeks or months before we can do anything on the matter.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, it is the judges that can do something about the next court appearance.\u201d\n\nNEWS DITECT had reported how the Benin Republic police two Mondays ago arrested Igboho at the Cardinal Bernardin International Airport in Cotonou, while trying to fly from the country to Germany.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) had on July 1 raided the residence of the activist in Ibadan, Oyo state.\n\nIgboho had planned a \u201dYoruba Nation Rally\u201d in Lagos two days before the raid.\n\nThe DSS raided the residence, killing two people and arresting 12 aides but Igboho escaped.\n\nThe agency alleged that Igboho was stockpiling weapons, and subsequently declared him wanted.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Police Force Thursday acknowledged receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against DCP Abba Kyari.\n\nBlueprint also gathered that the police hierarchy would be setting up a high-power panel to interrogate the propriety or otherwise of the allegation brought against Kyari by Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO) CP Frank Mba said the Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba has ordered internal review of Hushpuppi\u2019s claims.\n\nMba, who disclosed this in a statement Thursday in Abuja, said: \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba psc (+), NPM, fdc has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\n\n\u201cFurther developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly.\u201d\n\nU.S Court\n\nA court in the United States of America had issued a warrant of arrest on Kyari over his alleged links to Hushpuppi.\n\nA spokesperson in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed that the warrant was issued by U.S Magistrate Judge Otis Wright.\n\nKyari had arrested and jailed one Chibuzo Vincent, an estranged co-conspirator in a $1.1million fraud case at the behest of Hushpuppi.\n\nThe DCP also allegedly sent a bank account to Hushpuppi reportedly for the payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nThe trial\n\nHushpuppi, who had pleaded guilty to the multi-million dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government, risks 20 years in prison.\n\nHe reportedly explained how the proceeds from the crime were spent leading to the indictment of DCP Kyari.\n\nAccording to the indictment, \u201cAbbas was assisted in laundering the proceeds of the fraud by Rukayat Motunraya Fashola, a.k.a. Morayo, 28, of Valley Stream, New York, and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka, a.k.a. Bolamide, 34, of Linden, New Jersey. These two defendants also were arrested on July 22, 2021, by FBI agents.\n\n\u201cApproximately $230,000 of the stolen funds allegedly were used to purchase a Richard Mille RM11-03 watch, which was hand-delivered to Abbas in Dubai and subsequently appeared in Hushpuppi\u2019s social media posts.\n\n\u201cOther illicit proceeds from the scheme were allegedly converted into cashier\u2019s checks, including $50,000 in checks that were used by Abbas and a co-conspirator to fraudulently acquire a St. Christopher and Nevis citizenship, as well as a passport for Abbas obtained by creating a false marriage certificate and then bribing a government official in St. Kitts.\n\n\u201cCourt documents outline a dispute among members of the conspiracy, which allegedly prompted Vincent to contact the victim and claim that Abbas and Juma were engaged in fraud. After this contact, Abbas allegedly arranged to have Vincent jailed in Nigeria by Abba Alhaji Kyari, 46, of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to the affidavit, Kyari is a highly decorated deputy commissioner of the Nigeria Police Force, who is alleged to have arranged for Vincent to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\n\u201cKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment,\u201d the US court document read in part.\n\nI\u2019m innocent \u2013 Kyari\n\nCountering the claims in a Facebook post Thursday, DCP Kyari denied the allegations, assuring he would be vindicated at the end of the travails.\n\nThe senior police officer said he did not demand any money from Hushpuppi. He, however, said he introduced the accused to a cloth seller whom Hushpuppi paid about N300, 000.\n\nThe Facebook post reads in part: \u201cFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about two years ago that somebody in Nigeria seriously threatened to kill his family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s phone number and pleaded we take action before the person attacks his family.\n\n\u201cWe traced and arrested the suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life and they were long time friends who had money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office.\n\n\u201cNobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him. We responded to a distress call he made on threat to his family and released the suspect when we discovered there was no life threat from the Suspect. This is the true story. Vincent is alive, he can be contacted.\u201d\n\nKyari further stated that, \u201cFor those who are celebrating that this is an indictment on us and mentioning some fictitious big money they will be disappointed once again as our hands are clean and our record of service for two decades is open for everybody to see.\n\n\u201cThey will continue seeing us serving our father land and we will continue responding to all distress calls from all Nigerians provided they are life threatening.\u201d",

Mr. Kyari had also arrested and jailed one Chibuzo Vincent, at the behest of Hushpuppi.\n\nHe also allegedly sent Hushpuppi bank account details into which Hushpuppi could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\n\nREAD ALSO: US Court Issues Arrest Warrant For Abba Kyari\n\nThe highly celebrated police officer in a Facebook post on Thursday denied the allegations, however, there are Nigerians who believe he should be extradited to the US to clear his name of the allegations against him.\n\nProfessor Moghalu is one of such who believes the law must be made to take its due course. In a statement titled \u201cThis Is Not A Movie: DCP Kyari And The Long Arm of Justice,\u201d the former Deputy Governor of the CBN noted that the same way Federal Government under Buhari has arrested Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and are also seeking to extradite Yoruba Nation Agitator, Sunday Igboho, from the Benin Republic, they should also follow due process in the case against Kyari.\n\nMoghalu insisted that the FBI\u2019s request for the extradition of Kyari in the Hushpuppi case will put Buhari and Nigeria in the global spotlight, adding that Nigeria and the United States have an extradition treaty which has been used in a number of cases.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat leadership calls for is obvious, President Buhari should respect laws and follow due process\u201d.\n\nWhile stressing that Nigeria and indeed the world is watching, Professor Moghalu urged the federal government to ensure that it does not disrespect international law in black and white when it comes to certain Nigerians.",

          "text": "You\u2019re probably living under a rock if you\u2019ve not heard about intermittent fasting because it\u2019s one of the most popular health and fitness trends right now.\n\nIt was the most googled diet last year.\n\nI got on the intermittent fasting plan in 2016 when I finally decided to do something about my weight and relationship with food and it was really transformative for me.\n\nI lost about 30kg in six months but weightl oss wasn\u2019t the only benefit I got on this plan.\n\nThe biggest thing was how drastic my cravings reduced and I\u2019ve been able to keep the extra weight off.\n\nIntermittent fasting is a feeding plan that alternates between fasting and feeding periods, the goal is to systematically starve the body long enough to trigger fat burning.\n\nWhile research is still being done and the method may not be suitable for everyone, there is evidence that when done correctly it can help lose weight, lower blood pressure and cholesterol prevent/ control diabetes and improve brain health.\n\nWhen we eat, nutrients in food are broken down into glucose, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and is transported into the various organs where it serves as the major energy source.\n\nExcess glucose is stored for later in the liver and adapose tissues as glycogen and fat.\n\nIn between meals, when the body is in the fasted state, the liver converts glycogen back to glucose to supply the body with energy.\n\nTypically, an inactive persons takes about 10 to 12 hours to use up the glycogen stores, although someone who exercises may do so in much less time.\n\nOnce the reserve of glucose is used up, the body taps into energy source in the adapose tissues.\n\nThis is when fats are broken down into metabolic fuel called ketones, which are also tremendous for modulating inflammation in the brain.\n\nThis is why people on intermittent fasting plan will experience a reduce in brain fog.\n\nIf the fast lasts long enough, the body burns fat for energy.\n\nYou\u2019ll lose all that extra fat and losing this extra fat has been associated with a range of health benefits.\n\nInsulin is the hormone responsible for driving glucose into the cells, so it is regulated to match the amount of glucose in the blood, which is high after a meal and low between meals.\n\nBecause insulin is secreted after each meal, eating throughout the day keeps insulin levels high most of the time.\n\nConstant high insulin levels may desensitize body tissues, causing insulin insensitivity, the hallmark of pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes.\n\nFasting helps keep insulin levels low, reducing the risk of diabetes.\n\nFasting however is not for everyone. You shouldn\u2019t attempt this feeding plan if you are a child or teen, pregnant or breastfeeding, have an eating disorder or underweight.\n\nOr if you\u2019re dealing with diabetes type 1 or advanced diabetes and some other health issues.\n\nPlease consult your doctor or physician before going on this plan.\n\nFor intermittent fasting to be safe and effective, it must be combined with balanced meals that provide good nutrition.\n\nIt is important to stay hydrated and avoid overeating, especially unhealthy food when breaking your fast and during your feeding window.\n\nNext week I\u2019ll write a complete beginners guide to intermittent fasting for those that are curious, and common mistakes that may be stalling your results.\n\nArinola Odunuga",

          "text": "Royal Dutch Shell has launched a major divestment of its Nigerian assets, several sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nShell has hired Standard Chartered to sell its Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) subsidiary, two of the sources said.\n\nSPDC operates the company\u2019s shallow-water and onshore asset interests via its 30% interest in the SPDC joint venture, which supplies around 10% of Nigeria\u2019s gas demand.\n\nSale documents were issued earlier this week and expressions of interest (EOIs) are due by 10 September, the other source said.\n\nThe vendor is asking for non-binding offers in the subsequent second phase, this source said.\n\nShell is selling the business because it no longer views its activities in the Niger Delta as core to its ongoing strategy, which is driven by the ESG pressure from its investors, both sources said, and as intimated by its CEO earlier this year.\n\nAlso, several of the oil mining leases (OMLs) have upcoming development costs, which Shell does not intend to fund, one of the sources added.\n\nIt will still retain its deepwater assets in the country, this source added.\n\nThe business will be worth several billions of dollars, this source said. Shell will want full-value offers for the business but is strategically driven in this disposal and will likely prefer low execution risk to waiting for a knockout offer, this source said.\n\nIt is very likely too large for any single acquiror, this and a third source, and a banker following the deal said.\n\nThe valuation will ultimately be derived from different views on the separate assets \u2014 the shallow-water fields, the onshore fields and the infrastructure, for which there could be separate buyers, one of the sources said.\n\nAlternatively, Shell may sell portions of equity in the whole of SPDC to different consortia of buyers, this source said.\n\nEither way, buyers will need to have a local Nigerian element, this and another of the sources said.\n\nThe assets in the Niger Delta region are plagued with security issues and would, in particular, need a very local participant and lender, one of the sources said.\n\nPrivate equity would struggle with this associated risk and with the expected necessary investment in the portfolio, this source said.\n\nPublic-listed companies would struggle to raise equity to execute the deal, given the ESG-derived sentiment for oil and gas in the public markets, this source said. Local sponsors may be interested, but this would constitute a very transformational deal, and would need significant lender support, this source said.\n\nAn international, private group with operating expertise, for example Perenco, or a Chinese player might make most sense, this source said.\n\nShell and Standard Chartered declined to comment.\n\nThe SPDC JV is co-owned with Eni [BIT:ENI] via its NOAC subsidiary with 5%, TotalEnergies [EPA:FP] via its Total E&P Nigeria subsidiary with 10%, and Nigeria\u2019s national oil company NNPC with the remaining 55%.\n\nThe joint venture owns 360 producing oil wells, 60 producing gas well, and a network of 4,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines and flowlines, Shell\u2019s website notes.\n\nOn 15 January this year, SPDC completed the sale of its 30% interest in OML 17 in the Eastern Niger Delta, and associated infrastructure, to TNOG Oil and Gas Ltd, a related company of Heirs Holdings Ltd and Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, for a consideration of USD 533m.\n\nIn 2020, output from the SPDC JV, together with Shell\u2019s SNEPCo subsidiary, fell from the record highs of 2019 but, at around 620kbpd of oil equivalent remained close to the five-year average of 625,000.\n\nNigeria is becoming an increasingly difficult jurisdiction in which to operate, a sector advisor following the sale said. Poor engagement by the government with international energy majors is driving many away, and this is further exacerbated by recent legislation such as the Nigerian Petroleum Bill, this advisor noted.\n\nShell first announced its plans to sell down its Nigerian onshore interests during its annual general meeting in May. \u201cWe have been reviewing positions that continue to be challenged from an environmental perspective \u2026 and a particular point of attention has been onshore oil in Nigeria,\u201d its CEO Ben van Buerden said.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years we have reduced the total number of licences in onshore Nigeria by half. But unfortunately, our remaining onshore oil operations continue to be subject to sabotage and theft \u2026 This means that the balance of risk and reward associated with our onshore oil portfolio in Nigeria is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions. Because of this, we have started discussions with the Nigerian government to align on a way to move forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve drawn that conclusion, and we\u2019re now talking to the Nigerian government on the way forward.\u201d",
