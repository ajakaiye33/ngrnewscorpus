A lot of guys are using my name; Obi Cubana, Obi Iyiegbu to do a lot of bad things on Facebook. The name Obi Cubana is not associated with anything bad or evil. Please disregard, block, report.\n\n\u201cFor me to come up to do this, you guys should know that it is really getting at me.

          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nABUJA- The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Friday, chided President Muhammadu Buhari for cancelling his planned visit to troubled Zamfara state.\n\nThis is as the party dismissed the President\u2019s excuse of not travelling to Zamfara State because of inclement flying weather, \u201cwhen he had the option of travelling the short trip from Sokoto to Gusau by road.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by its spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, the PDP had this to say: \u201cWe ask, did Mr. President cancel the trip to Zamfara state out of fear of terrorists? Was Mr. President, an Army General, with all the security apparatus under his command afraid to travel by road because he was not sure of his security as well as the dilapidated state of our roads under his watch?\n\nREAD ALSO:APC led FG created problems of banditry in Nigeria \u2013 Benue Govt\n\n\u201cFrom Sokoto to Gusau, the Zamfara state capital is about 206 kilometers, a journey a leader who has the interest of the people at heart and who is sure of his security could have undertaken by road.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari ought to have reassured Nigerians by travelling to Gusau, instead he opted for a video broadcast in which he promised the troubled people of the state that he looks \u2018forward to a more weather-friendly period when I will visit.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is another sad demonstration of the President leading from behind against his own promise and commitment to Nigerians to lead from the front in the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cSuch attitude to governance speaks volumes as to why our nation is in a shambolic state under the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration which is largely laid-back, unconcerned and corrupt.\n\n\u201cIf truly the people matter to Mr. President and his Party, the APC; if truly President Buhari and the APC believe in Nigerians and feel their pains; if truly they are very concerned about the wellbeing of the people, then Mr. President would have taken it upon himself, with all the apparatus of power at his disposal, to visit and empathize with the people of Zamfara State who are daily traumatized by terrorists.\n\n\u201cOur party is not particularly surprised because this is a Party and President which is always absent in critical areas of our national life. Such absenteeism from responsibility is the hallmark of the APC. Even when prodded to visit such areas, President Buhari will always dwell on excuses, blame game and buck passing.\n\n\u201cNigerians have not forgotten the sad episode of the Agatu Massacre in Benue State wherein President Buhari, on March 12, 2018, told a bewildered nation that he was not aware that the Inspector General of Police was not in the area as directed by him.\n\n\u201cIn Mr. President\u2019s words, \u2018I\u2019m not aware that the I.G did not spend 24 hours in the state as directed by me, I am getting to know in this meeting.\u2019 Such was a miserable demonstration of abdication of leadership.\n\n\u201cIndeed, such resort to leadership by proxy is inexcusable and completely unacceptable. Our nation needs a leadership that is active, people-oriented, humane, functional and result-driven; a task which the APC as a party of propaganda, deceit and lies cannot deliver on.\n\n\u201cThe PDP sympathizes with the people of Zamfara state for being made to waste their meagre resources to organize for a Presidential visit only to get an embarrassing and uninspiring video broadcast.\n\n\u201cThe PDP however calls on Nigerians not to despair but remain resolute in rallying on the platform of our Party in our mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the stranglehold of misrule. They must keep hope alive as help is on the way from the PDP, come 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\n.\n\nThis came as the government identified the burden of NTDs as enormous, saying the disease was affecting more than one billion people globally across 149 countries with Africa bearing about half of the global burden.\n\nMinister of State for Health, Dr Olorunimbe Mamora, speaking Friday, at a press conference held to mark the 3rd World NTD celebration in Nigeria, said\n\nNigeria was contributing substantially to the Africa NTDs\u2019 burden with more than 120 million of its people living at risk of one Neglected Tropical Disease or the other.\n\nREAD ALSOPolice Commission workers commence warning strike over recruitment of 10,000 Constables\n\nMamora, who said NTDs were found in several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, explained that the disease was common in tropical areas where people do not have access to clean water or safe ways to dispose of human waste.\n\nRecall that NTDs include diseases such as Lymphatic Filariasis, Onchocerciasis, Schistosomiasis, Soil-Transmitted Helminthes, Buruli Ulcers, ,Leisnmaniasis, Dengue, Guinea Worm Disease, Trachoma, Leprosy, Rabies, Noma, Yaws and Macetoma.\n\nRecall also that in June 2017,snakebite was included among NTDs by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nMost of these diseases are of public health importance in Nigeria and impact negatively on socio-economic development.\n\nAccording to Mamora,\u201dThe purpose of the World NTDs Day is to create global and national awareness to mobilize resources to address the magnitude of NTDs concerns, provide opportunities for stakeholders to highlight the progress made, challenges encountered and advocate for support for the prevention, control and elimination effort in the fight against NTDs in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe theme of the campaign for 2022 World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day (WNTDD) is: \u201cAchieving health equity to end the neglect of poverty-related diseases\u201d could not have come at a better and more appropriate time than now when WHO is organizing a virtual event calling on everyone to address the inequalities that characterize NTDs,\u201dhe added.\n\n\u201cThe WNTDD is an opportunity to re-energize the momentum to end the suffering from these 20 diseases that are caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and toxins. The day will help us focus on millions of people who have limited or no access to prevention, treatment and care services.\n\n\u201cThe recent roll out of the ten years NTDs road map for the period of 2021-2030 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 28\u2033 of January 2021 which proposed ambitious targets and innovative approaches towards tackling NTDs provides a clear blueprint and direction towards NTDs elimination globally\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe plan promotes working across NTDs in an integrated manner to deliver programme objectives of interrupting and eliminating NTDs with emphasis on three significant approaches: moving from process to impact measuring for accountability, putting in place effective multi-sectoral approach/integration across NTDs, countries ownership and political commitment for sustainability. In line with that, Nigeria is currently reviewing her NTDs Master Plan to guide all stakeholders and Partners,\u201dhe further said.\n\nHe said Nigeria \u201csupports efforts by the International NGO, United to Combat NTD team to engage with disease endemic countries, stakeholders and partners to contribute to the development of Kigali Declaration on NTDs which proves government\u2019\n\ns collective commitments in the spirit of true partnership of countries to the ownership of this important document in consonance with the WHO road map.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for me to thank the Executive Director of UTC NTDs and her team for her leadership in advancing the NTDs campaign across the globe as well as our own Sen. Dr. Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, her Nigeria counterpart in this regard. Permit me to assure you that Nigeria remains committed to working with you and the Task Team in delivering this \u2018\u2019Kigali Declaration on NTDs\u2019\u2019 document\u201d,he said.\n\nMamora also disclosed that FMOH has been collaborating and working with all relevant stakeholders particularly our Non-Governmental Development Organizations (NGDO) partners to tackle the menace of NTDs in Nigeria.\n\nHe spoke further:\u201dI am particularly glad to report that substantial progress has been made over the last decade as evidenced by the fact that we have been able fo eradicate Guineaworm Disease, eliminated transmission of Onchocerciasis in Plateau and Nasarawa States and very soon some other states will be free of the disease. Other achievemenis by the ministry include:\n\n\u201cGuinea worm Elimination had been achieved in December 2013, on the recommendation of the WHO certification commission whereby Nigeria was declared free of guinea-worm disease\u201d.\n\n\u201cElimination of Onchocerciasis in Nassarawa and Plateau has been achieved. This was confirmed through entomological studies conducted in the above mentioned state in 2019. While we are approaching elimination phase in Kaduna, Kebbi and Zamfara States\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Programme also conducted epidemiological mapping on the preventable NTDs in all the 774 LGAs in the couniry\u201d.\n\n\u201cConduct Mass Administration of Medicine on School based/ Community deworming programme and also Mass Drugs Administration on Lymphatic Filariasis, Schistosomiasis in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cOut of 122 endemic LGAs for Trachoma in the country, 96 LGAs have attained elimination threshold for the active stage of the disease while 61 LGAs have attained elimination threshold for the blinding stage of the disease. This has reduced the prevalence of Trachoma to about 6.9 million (79%) Entomological survey 2017 conducted\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn innovative management of NIDs, The programme has been able to develop a National Policy document on Snakebite management along with procurement of Anti-Snake venom (ASV) and distributed to designated Health Facility centres in six (6) geo political zone\u201d.\n\n\u201cYaws case search was conducted in 3 communities in Plateau and Nassarawa States with over 40 cases isolated\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe programme was operating on paper based reporting system but currently there is a training going on to strengthen M&E Unit to migrate from paper base of data to electronic reporting system using DHIS 2.0\u201d\n\n\u201cThe programme also develop and train officers on the use of Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) tool to monitor drug distribution, consumption and report adverse effect of those drugs on pharmacovigilance forms in line with NAFDAC policy\u201d.",

          "title": "\u2018How my husband was lured, murdered at Enugu APC meeting\u2019",
          "text": "In spite of the persistent cry of her 15-month-old son, Chidimma Lilian Ezeoha looked forlorn as she gazed hopelessly into space on her late husband\u2019s veranda. She clutched the crying baby on her right lap while her three-year-old daughter sat on the left. She heaved heavy sighs and moaned intermittently as she brooded over the death of her husband.\n\nA delegation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by the immediate past chairman of the party in Enugu State, Dr. Ben Nwoye, had visited the bereaved family\u2019s residence in Amechi Awkunanaw community in Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State on Friday to commiserate with them over the death of their son and former LGA youth leader of the party in the area, Kelvin Ezeoha.\n\nEzeoha, 46, and another party member, Chidera Ogaba, were brutally murdered penultimate Tuesday when yet-to-be-identified gunmen invaded the APC Ward 111 meeting at Obeagu, in Enugu South Council area at about 7 pm.\n\nThe hooded gunmen numbering about seven also abducted Mr. Mike Ogbonna a.k.a. Okwadike in the meeting called to reconcile the two factions of the party in the area as part of the ongoing effort to unite all members of the party in the state.\n\nSpeaking to The Nation, Ezeoha\u2019s widow, who was still in shock, said since the news of her husband\u2019s death, she was convinced that her late husband was lured to the APC ward meeting where he was brutally murdered by gunmen.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNarrating her husband\u2019s last moments before he went to the ill-fated meeting, Chidimma, who is heavily pregnant, said his death had destabilised her and members of the larger family.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe was loved by all. He was my hero, always called upon to settle issues.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that around 5pm, he came back and told me that he wanted to go for a meeting. Earlier in the morning they had a meeting with some APC chieftains.\n\n\u201cHe had earlier in the morning told me that they would be holding a meeting. I asked him which meeting and he said it was a meeting of harmonisation of party leadership. He said that those people would come to his house.\n\n\u201cThe people later came. I was inside the house with my children because of my condition when I overheard him discussing with people who visited that morning.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting, he came into the room and told me that he was going to see a party member and return to the house in the evening.\n\n\u201cAfter he came back, I had a discussion with him like husband and wife. He embraced me and said he wanted to attend another meeting. I guess that was the meeting of his family.\n\n\u201cBut before then, I noticed that were people calling him repeatedy and he was telling them he was coming. That was what I know. The rest is the story that people told me.\n\n\u201cBut the way the story came to me, because I wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019m convinced that they lured my husband to the APC meeting to kill him there.\u201d\n\nThe deceased cousin and age mate, Ugwo Chigbuo, who witnessed his death, said the manner Kelvin Ezeoha was being called to attend the APC meeting showed there was more to his death than ordinary gunmen attack.\n\nNarrating the incident in a chat with our correspondent, Chigbuo said: \u201cOn Tuesday January 18, I visited him in his house here. I met him as he was trying to prepare water and feed for his chicks.\n\n\u201cHe received a call at about 9 to 10 am. The call came from one of his APC members. After the call, he told me that it was Okwadike that called him and that he (Okwadike) was coming to visit him alongside Cool Water. I don\u2019t know them, because I\u2019m not a politician.\n\n\u201cAfter about 45 minutes later, the people in question visited him. Three of them sat outside the house doing a small meeting. He told me that he and the two visitors were going somewhere and that when he returned in the evening, we would go for our family meeting by Topland, Onuorie there.\n\n\u201cLater in the evening, he called me and we went to the family meeting.\n\n\u201cWhile the meeting was ongoing, there were some distressed calls coming to his phone between 5.20 pm and 6 pm. Our family meeting chairman asked him who was distracting him in that meeting and Kelvin said that it was those he was supposed to have APC meeting with at Obeagu. We ended the family meeting around 5.25 pm.\n\n\u201cAfter the family meeting had ended, he told me and one other brother, Chibuzo Agbo, to join him in his car to the meeting at the APC office, Obeagu. Chibuzo Agbo dropped off, saying he had something urgent to do. Kelvin now turned to me and begged that I join him so that we could go briefly and come back. I obliged.\n\n\u201cWe got to the APC party office at about 6.50pm. Many people who attended the meeting were already leaving. Some we met at the gate told him that the meeting had dismissed. It was just a few others who were waiting for him that remained.\n\n\u201cAs we entered into the place where the remaining party chieftains were gathered, we were just greeting people.\n\n\u201cIt was just about three minutes as we were still standing that we heard gunshots outside the gate and some people rushed into the place. They were masked, dressed in black. They were seven in number. Three of them first came in.\n\n\u201cWhen they came in, people started running helter-skelter. I was fortunate enough to have run into the main office there. I ran towards the door and there were another three of the armed men who met us face to face. They ordered us to lie down. Fortunately, those guys matched on us and passed.\n\n\u201cAt that point, my brother was still outside where the meeting took place. I heard two other gunshots inside the place. I didn\u2019t know that the gunshots were on my brother, Kelvin Ezeoha.\n\n\u201cIt was later I heard that they took Okwadike away.\n\n\u201cThe next gunshots were about 50 metres away from that venue. I now felt they were gone.\n\n\u201cWhen we rushed out, it was about 7.05pm. We saw someone crying for help. I was busy calling people to help us so we could take him to the hospital. As I was shouting, one small boy came and shouted from inside the meeting venue that another person was killed.\n\n\u201cI rushed into the premises only to find my brother in a pool of blood, lying motionless. I pushed him but he didn\u2019t shake. He was shot in the forehead.\n\n\u201cMy body started shaking. I was trying to make calls but my phone was falling down. That was how my phone broke. The shock was too much for me.\n\n\u201cI had never witnessed this kind of thing in my life; somebody I came out with killed just like that.\u201d\n\nThe shocked family of the deceased is calling on the Enugu State Police Command to fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime.\n\nAccording to a family member and former Nigerian Ambassador to Japan, Ambassador Goddy Agbo, Ezeoha\u2019s death was an orchestrated act.\n\nAmbassador Agbo, a former member of House of Representatives, said: \u201cI was the person who conveyed his remains to the morgue.\n\n\u201cFrom what I observed at the scene of the incident, the murder was an orchestrated act. Therefore, we are calling on the law enforcement agents and state government to leave no stone unturned in apprehending those behind the dastardly act. Kelvin was killed with a military riffle.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of Umuochieonah Family, Evangelist Wilson Ogbe described Kelvin\u2019s death as very tragic, saying the entire family was still in shock.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were holding a family meeting and his phone kept ringing. After we have ended our meeting, he left, and less than 30 minutes later, we received a call that he had been killed at the venue of his party\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cFrom the whole thing that transpired before he left for that meeting, we as a family have concluded that Kevin\u2019s death was a calculated action.\n\n\u201cKelvin was a good son and brother. He was somebody anyone could relate with. We are shattered as a family because of his murder.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we have lost an illustrious son. He was a man of integrity and I\u2019m sure it will be hard to get someone like him again in this family.\u201d\n\nThe family therefore called on the security agencies in Enugu State to intervene and bring the murderers of their brother to book.\n\nAlso, the family of Chidera Ogaba, who was equally slain in the ill-fated meeting, is demanding justice for the gruesome killing of their promising son.\n\nThe 28-year-old Ogaba, who was an undergraduate of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUTH), was reportedly shot three times in the waist and left side of his chest.\n\nHis elder brother, Mr Ogaba Oliver, described his death as strange, saying his family was yet to come to terms with it.\n\nOliver also described as thrash the stories being peddled that it was the ESN/IPOB that killed his brother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that trash. The people who planned his assassination want to tag it IPOB/ESN so that security agencies will not investigate his killing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that because ESN doesn\u2019t kidnap people. Those who killed him made sure that he died instantly, because they shot him five times \u2013 two shots in his left chest and three on his leg.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go outside the community. In short from our house to the party office where the meeting held is less than four poles. I believe it was a well planned political assassination.\u201d",

          "title": "Crisis rocks Rufus Giwa Polytechnic over non-payment of salaries, pensions, others",
          "text": "The failure of the management of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State to pay the salaries, pensions and gratuities of the institution\u2019s staff as and when due in the last five years has pitted it against the workers, GBENGA ADERANTI reports.\n\nThe just concluded yuletide was a bleak one for the workers at Ondo State owned Rufus Giwa Polytechnic (RUGIPO), Owo. The failure of the institution\u2019s management to pay the 13-month salaries owed the workers besides unpaid pensions and gratuities of its retirees made the yuletide holiday very dry and uneventful.\n\nIt was only in the afternoon of January 4 that the accounts of the staff of the institution were credited with the balance of January 2021 salaries as well as those of February and March.\n\nEven at that, the payment of the three-month arrears of salaries was not done until a threat was issued by the institution\u2019s chapter of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics (SSANIP) to embark on what it described a massive protest to express its displeasure at the \u201cobnoxious and authoritarian action of the school\u2019s management.\u201d\n\nAlthough a source said the money had been with the management on Friday, it only waited till Monday, January 4 before it was disbursed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSSANIP had in a letter dated January 4, 2022 communicated its communiqu\u00e9, signed by union\u2019s Chairman and Secretary, Comrade Olowolade Chris and Comrade Ojo Akinyemi, to the school\u2019s authorities, respectively, asking the state government and the RUGIPO management to consider the grouse of the union and do the needful.\n\nBut the crisis in the institution took another dimension when the management of the institution, while responding to the threat, suspended the activities of the union.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the workers in the state owned institution were still being owed 11-month salaries, excluding deductions.\n\nReflecting on the poor state of the school\u2019s financial institution, a source close to the institution explained that things are so bad that the institution has shut down its staff school because of its inability to pay staff salaries.\n\n\u201cSome of the children of the staff of RUGIPO who were before now students of the staff school are out of school as the staff school is currently shut and the staff members don\u2019t have money to pay for their children in good schools,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the staff school was closed down because the management of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic felt the staff school was not productive. Unfortunately, when the staff of the school were about to be sacked, the RUGIPO management did conversion and absorbed some of the staff that were close to the management into the institution and closed down the staff school.\n\nThe sacked 53 members of the staff school lost their case in court because they were not able to present enough papers to back them up.\n\nJustifying the sack of the 53 teachers of the staff school, the source said, the school could only generate about N5 million and was using N25 million to fund the school.\n\nFaulting the claim of the management, a staff of the institution said \u201cis there any place the government has been able to break even in the educational system?\u201d\n\nTo worsen matters, the source said, the institution\u2019s intake has reduced drastically as it has increased school fees twice in the last seven years due to what it called \u201cthe financial recklessness of the management of the institution\u201d.\n\nAs at the time they made the increment the school had over 12,000 students, right after the increment the student population dropped to less than 2000.\n\nThough the fee was reviewed as a result of drop in the enrollment, this did not assuage the applicants.\n\nAside from increasing the school fees, the management jerked up some of the fees being paid by the students. A student that did OND at RUGIPO, and wants to do HND there is charged N11,500 for transcripts. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect them to come back to that institution. Apart from that, the act is fraudulent. You don\u2019t do or pay for transcript to continue your education in the same school.\u201d\n\nOur correspondents gathered at the time of writing this report, members of the school\u2019s staff were owed about six-month cooperative deductions.\n\nSome members of the staff who retired about 17 years ago, at the time of writing this report, were yet to be paid their entitlements.\n\nNot minding the precarious financial state of the institution, the present management employed over 500 staff without any advert or interview even when they are unable to pay the salaries of the existing staff, said another source.\n\nIn the heat of the crisis, the management suspended both the chairman Comrade Ijawoye Dare and the secretary Comrade Arikawe Ade of the academic union ASUP, even when the court asked that the parties in dispute should return to status quo, only the secretary was reinstated.\n\nIt was gathered that the Chairman and the Secretary of the union were initially sent out of the school because of their insistence in making sure that the cooperative deductions were paid. \u201cThe governor gave the institution N524 million, the money was enough to pay two months salaries, the union had meetings with the Rector where he promised pay one month and the balance of N250 million, N100 million for the retirees and the rest 150 million for the cooperative, as we are speaking, they have not paid it,\u201d a member of the institution disclosed to The Nation.\n\nAnother issue the staff are not happy about is the promotion policy of RUGIPO source who is close to the institution wondered why the council and management policies of non-promotion of staff since 2017 as well as the 2012 notional promotion of workers, contrary to the state policy of workers motivation in the area of staff welfare in the state and local government respectively.\n\nThe management came out with a policy, hinging promotion of academic staff to the ability to bring investors to the institution. \u201cIt is only when you bring investors that can enhance your promotion and there must be a vacancy academic staff before promotion. Academic staff members don\u2019t require the existence of a vacancy anywhere before they are promoted; they only need to publish required number of papers whenever they are due for promotion.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering, that place has sunk,\u201d an academic staff of the institution said.\n\nRetirees lament\n\nIf the non-payment of salaries is bad for workers, withholding pensioners\u2019 entitlements is worse. For retirees of the Ondo state government owned tertiary institution, life has been brutish.\n\nMany of the retirees are said to have been sent into early graves as a result of paucity of funds to take care of their basic needs, especially health. Some of the retirees are praying to die quietly rather than continue to live in shame and suffering.\n\nAs at 2020, the institution was alleged to owe more than 1billion naira in pensions and gratuities. While many of the retirees were ready to speak about their plight, they declined revealing their identities for fear of not getting their pension and gratuities.\n\nOne of the retirees, who exited the institution some years back, complained that ever since he retired from the Ondo State owned institution he had not collected his gratuities and pension.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me, I have nobody that I\u2019m training now. My children are independent. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues are not that lucky as most of their children still depend on them one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI understand that sometime in 2019, one of my colleagues died because he didn\u2019t have money to buy drugs to manage his ailment. It is as bad as that,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: How kidnapped Plateau poly students, one other escaped from abductors\n\nA source also said that as at July 24, 2020, 29 retirees had died without being paid any fraction of their retirement benefits. Another retiree who is based in Akure also said that each time he thinks about his colleagues who have nothing to fall back on, he feels bad.\n\n\u201cThe state government has to be proactive in handling this matter. For the retirees, pay them half of their gratuities. Pay the salaries up to date,\u201d he counseled.\n\nThe retiree also advised Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to pay a visit to the state owned institution because some people are not telling him the truth about the situation in the school.\n\n\u201cThe governor should go there and find out the truth,\u201d the retiree said.\n\nA group, Owo Generation Next, in one of its statements about the situation in the polytechnic, had expressed deep concern about what they described as the \u2018impunity\u2019 the management of the institution had been perpetrating.\n\nIt also alleged that the management of the institution is enmeshed in contract award scam as contract awards are usually advertised in newspapers that are only found in the Northern part of Nigeria.\n\nThe group called on the governor of the state to intervene urgently in the affairs of the polytechnic by clearing the salary arrears of the workers and by dismantling \u201cthe nest of fraudsters\u201d in the Polytechnic.\n\nWhy present management team should not be blamed\n\nWhile many would not blame the current Council Chairman of the polytechnic, Barrister Banji Alabi, for the situation of things, others are of the opinion that things were already very bad at the time Alabi assumed office.\n\nFindings made by our correspondent revealed that the 42-year-old institution is heavily indebted.\n\nStaff members averse management\u2019s financial secrecy\n\nWhile the precarious financial predicament of the institution did not start with the present management, a source said it became pronounced with the present management because of what a source termed \u2018financial secrecy\u2019.\n\nUnlike the former management of the institution, the present management is not trusted with the finances of the school.\n\nAccording to the source, if the welfare of the staff had been taken care of, nobody would look or talk about how they manage the finances of the but because the welfare of the staff are not well taken care of, there are bound to be issues. \u201cWe had past rectors; we never knew how they ran the school because the staff members were satisfied as regard the welfare. In this case we have never had it so bad in that institution,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhy RUGIPO is crawling\n\nThe Nation gathered that the main challenge facing the institution is the over bloating of employment and employment racketeering.\n\nAt present, two traditional rulers are currently under the payroll of the institution. Though one had been in the system before he was selected to be king, the other one was employed on the throne. \u201cThe honorary thing for one that was in employment was to resign after he became the king. He didn\u2019t, he is still in the institution, taking two salaries at the same time. The other king is from the town of one of the principal officers of the school.\n\n\u201cThis same principal officer has two wives, the two wives work in the institution. His children are working in the institution. Six of the family members of the principal officer are working in the institution.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for the institution, the subvention is not enough to pay the workers\u2019 salaries, yet the institution has continued in its employment drive without recourse to due process.\n\nA source disclosed that the problem started from the day of the former rector because he employed more than necessary in the institution, he employed close to 400. \u201cThough he employed to recourse to due process, he was able to manage it because the school had enough Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). The former Rector would pay salaries before getting subvention from the government.\u201d\n\nAnother source also told The Nation that with the present management in the saddle, things may not work.\n\nAccording to the source, the current rector was already 63 years when he came on board contrary to the NBTE regulations that say he must not be more than 59 years because he has a single term of five years.\n\nIn the advert placed in the newspaper before the present rector was engaged, the part concerning the age limit as prescribed by the NBTE regulation was removed from that column that he should not be more than 59 years of age.\n\nThe source disclosed that the governor is not aware of most of the infractions in the institution as most of the people that are supposed to tell him the truth are being blocked.\n\nHe disclosed that the past rector spent a 5- year- single term, but the present Rector made his own and other principal officers 4-year renewable contrary to what is obtainable in all other institutions and that has been the NBTE regulation.\n\nThe source argued that the Rector being 65, ought to have retired way back.\n\nEarlier in January, there was a protest whereby the staff of the institution asked the council and the rector to go.\n\nAccording to the source, the protest was part of the reason the money paid in January to staff was paid. \u201cThe money that came was for eight months, as recourse to our subvention which was N199 million, but we use N250 million to pay salaries because of the mass employment they made. The money would have been enough to pay for the eight months\u2019 salary but we cannot. Even if the government pays us 100 percent of our money, allocation, by the time this gets to school the management will be forced to pay 35 per cent.\u201d\n\nGetting out of woods\n\nA source disclosed that it is not as if the problem of the institution is not unsurmountable and for the institution to survive, the state government should look at the staff and the manner at which they were engaged.\n\nThe source disclosed that the institution will continue to struggle financially as long as some people are still in the system.\n\n\u201cThe best thing that should have been done is something in management called, Last In First Out (LIFO), if they can do that things will be better. The over 600 newly employed should be disengaged first, restructure the system and look whether there is the need to engage people or not.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered that the only solution to the predicament of the institution right now is for the government to jerk up its subvention to N300 million. \u201cThat is when they can now accommodate everybody. Unfortunately the government is not ready to jerk it up because it did not ask them to employ more staff into the institution.\n\nManagement keeps mum\n\nCalls and WhatsApp messages our correspondent sent to the Rector of the institution were yet to be responded to at press time.\n\nThe Rector of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic neither returned the call made by the writer nor react to the questionnaire sent to his WhatsApp wall on January 6.

          "text": "The Office of the Clerk to the National Assembly is working to clean up the harmonised version of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 before transmission, The Nation learnt yesterday.\n\nThe move followed the harmonisation of the two versions of the Bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives during the week.\n\nThe Catholic Church said yesterday that the President\u2019s continued delay in signing the bill into law was unacceptable.\n\nThe painstaking clean-up of the Bill, The Nation gathered, was meant to ensure that the errors spotted in it were completely eliminated.\n\nA competent source familiar with the process told our correspondent that the people handling the assignment are not leaving any stone unturned in the bid to produce a clean copy for transmission to the President for assent.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe source also noted that those assigned the duty to produce an error-free copy are working at the speed of light in order to beat the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to him, the process is likely to be concluded this weekend or early next week.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThis time around, a thorough job will be done to eliminate all errors in whatever form.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill is so important to most Nigerians and it is critical to the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections that all hands should be on deck to get it right this time.\n\n\u201cThe two chambers have done their part. Every other process to transmit the Bill to the President for his assent is being pursued vigorously.\n\n\u201cA clean copy of the amended Act is likely to reach the President\u2019s desk next week.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in December 2021 vetoed the Bill and cited restriction of political parties to the direct mode of primary as the only means of nominating candidates for elections as the sole reason for his action.\n\nBuhari had said: \u201cAside the serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitute an affront to the right to freedom of association.\n\n\u201cIt is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of the internationally accepted electoral practices.\u201d\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the Senate passed the re-amended of the Bill, said the National Assembly decided to respond swiftly and patriotically to the President\u2019s observations.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today is to respond to the observation of Mr. President and that of our constituents and other stakeholders on the need for us to expedite action on addressing those observations made by Mr. President, and we have done that very patriotically,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nHe added: \u201cToday, as the bill stands, there is provision for all possible options for selection of candidates from presidency to councillorship.\n\n\u201cThe available options we have are: the direct primaries, indirect primaries, and consensus candidature.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that political parties are now, once this becomes law, challenged to ensure that they choose what is appropriate, what is suitable for them when it comes to the processes of producing their candidates.\n\n\u201cI will urge that we should practice all these three so that we are able to develop them, because there is advantage in each just as there could be disadvantage in all of them.\u201d\n\nIt will be recalled that some civil society organisations (CSOs) had claimed that they spotted drafting errors in the Bill earlier vetoed by the President, hence the determination of the legal department of the National Assembly to ensure that the Bill is free of any such errors before transmission.\n\nDelay of legislation unacceptable \u2014Catholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) yesterday questioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nCSN said the church is committed to free and fair elections in the country, emphasising that signing the Electoral Bill into law will aid the process.\n\nThe National Director of Social Communication, CSN, Very Rev. Fr. Michel Umoh, while briefing reporters on the state of the nation, said the church will continue to encourage Buhari to sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nConcerning the forthcoming 2023 general elections, Umoh said true Nigerians must rise in unison to act and lend their voices to all that is good and noble in order to save the country.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to go and obtain their voter cards, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must ensure that the process of obtaining the voter cards is made easy for people.\n\nUmoh also called on INEC to ensure that people\u2019s votes are counted during the election.\n\nHis words: \u201cPolitics is governance, so Catholic Church supports politics and it encourages members to support politics. But Catholic Church does not play party politics.\n\n\u201cSigning the electoral bill will ensure peaceful election. The government of the day is dillydallying on signing this bill.\n\n\u201cWe are against such dillydallying. President Muhammadu Buhari should sign the bill. Signing the bill will shape the process of having a free, fair and credible election.\n\n\u201cThe church will encourage the Presidency to ensure that the bill is signed. The church is out for honesty, transparency in political matters.\n\n\u201c The next dispensation, which we eagerly look forward to with hope, does not give room for trading blames or for those petty partisanships which have often been defined along tribal, ethnic, religious or political affiliations.\n\n\u201cThese tools, in the hands of typical politicians have been used for too long to mesmerize and exploit the people. Most politicians use them as a smokescreen to hide their clandestine interests and ambitions.\n\n\u201cThe only reasonable political consideration now left to choose from, irrespective of our tribe, tongue and religious beliefs, is between truth and falsehood, the good and the bad, the oppressed and the oppressor, the loyal and disloyal citizens of Nigeria. These are the only two parties that matter in the country now.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, is the time true Nigerians must rise in unison to act and lend their voices to all that is good and noble in order to save our country. It is time to wise up and correct the mistakes of the past that have plunged the nation into the excruciating pains we now experience.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for another chance if we are blessed to have this one, and we may not have another chance to rescue this nation if we fail to take advantage of this one.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, every good citizen of Nigeria must go out, to obtain their voter card while INEC must ensure that this process is made easy for the people and the people\u2019s votes are made to count during election.\u201d",

Your Excellency, I beg to, somewhat, disagree with you on the general state of insecurity in the country, which is presently, in a state of near collapse. Of more concern to me is your claims with respect to the Niger Delta or the South-South zone.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, a good amount of peace has come to the Niger Delta in the past few years. However, your claim as having been the main architect that brought the peace, does not properly convey what transpired. If you will recall, before your government came on board, insecurity which had reduced substantially during the tenure of your predecessor, resumed in a very alarming rate. The period saw the emergence of a new group, the Niger Delta Avengers, which virtually held your government hostage, oil production went down to as low as about 800,000 barrels per day. Your government adopted a military approach to quell the agitations, by deploying the so-called \u2018Operation Crocodile Smile\u2019 in August, 2016, which did not in any way solve the problem.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Our people are very conscious of the developments that your government is carrying out in other areas of the country with monies derived from oil exploration in their area.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, federal roads in the Niger Delta region have mostly collapsed and applying these funds to rehabilitate these collapsed roads, would have gone a long way to solve some of our problems.\n\n\u201cPlease Mr. President, I respectfully wish to state that your claim of bringing peace to the South-South geo-political zone, is untenable, untrue and without foundation.

          "text": "*Emefiele appeals to manufacturers to address high cost of cement, building materials\n\n*Rabiu: BUA to ramp up cement production to 17 million metric tonnes next year\n\nObinna Chima, Deji Elumoye and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for increased private sector investment in the country, assuring that his administration would continue to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive. Buhari also addressed the security challenges confronting the country and said his administration was committed to ensuring that peace reigned in every nook and cranny of the country.\n\nThe president spoke in Sokoto, at the inauguration of an ultra-modern three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto line four factory. He expressed delight in his administration\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation, and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, saying they are working.\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, in his address at the ceremony, urged manufacturers in the country to urgently control the rising prices of cement and other building materials.\n\nIn his remarks, Founder and Chairman of BUA Group, Alhaji Abdul Samad Rabiu, disclosed that his company was targeting to ramp up its total production capacity to 17 million metric tonnes of cement per annum next year.\n\nBuhari pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that would take advantage of the huge reservoir of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nThe president said, \u201cAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and, indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna states, where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised his commitment to peace and stability in all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure that normalcy returned to troubled areas.\n\nAccording to Buhari, \u201cWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programmes to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201cYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilise our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they were doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda. He noted that the company, which had completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and was set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believed in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the president said, \u201cI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-west region.\n\n\u201cI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed, every state, in Nigeria sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and, of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner. For example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201cWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, Buhari expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, will bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South-south to the South-east, North-central, and North-west geopolitical zones. He said the AKK project would significantly reduce the cost of operation for industries in the regions.\n\nThe president also reassured Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade, while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here. The task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Emefiele urged manufacturers to urgently address the rising prices of building materials, including cement.\n\nNigerians have continued to lament the soaring price of cement in recent times and urge the government to intervene.\n\nEmefiele stressed that manufacturers must first strive to satisfy the local market to help make cement affordable before exporting the product to external markets.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, there has recently been calls by construction companies urging our steel and cement manufacturers to do something about the sky-rocketing of these two essential items in the construction industry.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the cement industry remained key to solving the country\u2019s unemployment challenges as well as boosting growth.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are aware that some of our cement manufacturers are producing for both the domestic and export markets, but we urge them to pay more attention to satisfying the domestic needs so as to bring down prices.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the apex bank\u2019s commitment to providing needed support for importation of spares, plants and equipment needed to increase the production capacities of cement plants in the country. While calling on prospective investors to take advantage of the current incentives provided by government to boost the sector, he said the CBN was ready to provide the needed financing for both current and new investors in the industrial sector for the importation of requisite machinery.\n\nHe pointed out that as part of the efforts by the current administration to drive productivity in the industrial sector and conserve foreign exchange, a decision was taken by the government in 2015 to restrict access to foreign exchange for imports of 43 items, which could be produced in Nigeria, but for which billions of US Dollars were being expended annually on imports.\n\nThe CBN governor said cement was one of the restricted items, adding that in making the decision, government was aware that the key raw material required for the production of cement is limestone, which is readily available across the country. He said the decision of the apex bank to ban cement importation had yielded great results, pointing out that the country\u2019s cement production capacity has since more than doubled from 30 MTPA in 2014 to 60 MTPA in 2021.\n\nThe CBN governor said no dollar had been spent from the country\u2019s reserves on cement importation in the past seven years following the restriction placed on the importation of the commodity.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur nation has been able to conserve billions of dollars, as no dollar from our external reserves has been spent on imports of cement into the country in the last seven years.\u201d\n\nHe said the investments had saved and created several thousands of jobs across multiple sectors.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the achievements so far recorded in the cement sector were not a coincidence but a reflection of the success of the backward integration policy of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe CBN governor said with significant opportunities in housing, construction and related industries, there were still sufficient room for additional investments in the sector. He urged potential investors to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nHe also assured current and prospective investors in the industrial sector that the apex bank was ready to collaborate with stakeholders to facilitate the development of a viable manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cFor those who are willing to invest in new Greenfields or existing Brownfield projects, the CBN will provide all the support needed both in naira and dollars to import plant and equipment to actualise your dreams.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s stance was in harmony with the apex bank\u2019s resolve to create a professional and people-oriented central bank to act as financial catalyst for job creation and inclusive growth in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cI am particularly delighted to see that the painstaking efforts and ingenuity of Nigeria\u2019s private sector are yielding bountiful fruits in broad daylight.\n\n\u201cThese efforts, such as the one being displayed here today by the BUA Group, are critical complementary ingredients to reducing unemployment and boosting production activities in our country.\n\n\u201cNot least, also, these investments help to support the CBN\u2019s mandate of promoting stable macro-economic growth in the country.\n\n\u201cI would, therefore, like to congratulate the BUA Group led by its inspirational and imitable Group CEO, Alhaji Adbul Samad Rabiu, for this investment.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated further, \u201cThe BUA Group\u2019s investment in Sokoto and in other parts of Nigeria reflects their belief in our country, and in the immense opportunities available in the industrial sector, given the abundance of human and natural resources in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this facility, which cost millions of US Dollars, was fully funded by equity contributions of the BUA Group without resorting to any source of external finance\u2026\n\n\u201cFollowing implementation of this new directive, I am pleased to note that the production capacity of the cement industry in Nigeria has doubled from 30 million tonnes in 2014 to about 60m tonnes in 2021.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, Rabiu recalled that Buhari inaugurated the second line of the cement company\u2019s plant in 1985 when he was Head of State.\n\nThe industrialist pointed out that in the past six years, \u201cWe have completed four plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11 million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that next year, BUA Group intended to complete the construction of two new plants of three million metric tonnes each, saying construction is already on-going \u2013 one in Edo and the other in Sokoto.\n\n\u201cWe expect these plants to be completed next year, which will bring our total production capacity to 17million metric tonnes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to Your Excellency coming to commission them by the first quarter of 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nRabiu pledged that BUA would continue to invest in the cement industry until Nigeria became self-sufficient and cement was made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cMr. President, there are many reasons one can attribute to the important nature of this plant. The attendant effect of these investments in new factories goes beyond the community and the state. It extends to the region and the entire country.\n\n\u201cFrom a job creation and economic standpoint, the Sokoto plant continues to be the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-western part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAlso, by adding value to resources mined in Nigeria, Nigeria is being saved billions of US dollars in foreign exchange that would have been spent on importation, whilst also ensuring product availability.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 95 per cent of all the raw materials used in our cement manufacturing process are sourced locally. In addition to this, and our investment in social impact and CSR programmes for the community and Sokoto State at all levels, we are also committed to environmental sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe have diversified our energy sources by introducing greener alternatives \u2013 in this case, LNG \u2013 to power the kiln and 48 megawatts power plant. Our power plants are now running on 100 per cent LNG, leading to reduced carbon emissions. This is the first of its kind at any cement factory in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRabiu said this meant also that as soon as the AKK gas project came on stream, BUA would be ready to be one of the first off-takers.\n\nThis would also encourage further industrialisation within the region, open new industries and ensure greater development and prosperity for this region and the country in general.\n\n\u201cMr President, Sir, all of this will not have been possible without your support and commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy,\u201d Rabiu told Buhari.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs a proudly Nigerian company, we will do our best to continue to support those efforts. The support of the CBN and its governor in setting up this gigantic project is also worthy of mention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value because, as mentioned earlier, these industries potentially save the country billions of dollars yearly and also ensure products are readily available across the length and breadth of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Management of SPVs tops agenda\n\n*119 out of 161 awardees pay signature bonuses, 33 pending\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NURPC) yesterday moved to resolve all outstanding issues delaying the conclusion of the 2020 marginal oilfields bid process, which was conducted last year.\n\nAmong the top challenges hindering the awardees from settling down to finding \u201cfirst oil,\u201d the stakeholders agreed, was the differences among members of the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) set up by the commission to realise the objectives of the programme.\n\nWith the SPVs compelling the winners to co-own the assets, THISDAY observed that while a number of the indigenous award winners complained about non-payment of the bonuses by their partners, others complained about partial payment.\n\nThese, it was learnt, hindered the progress of the initiative, which saw the award of 57 marginal fields to 161 Nigerian entities, from which about N175 billion had been raised by the federal government so far.\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, fields were classified as marginal when they were not considered by licence holders for immediate development due to assumed marginal economics under prevailing conditions or left unattended for more than 10 years. They also included assets that leaseholders considered for farm-out due to portfolio rationalisation or those, which the president may, from time to time, identify as such.\n\nSpeaking during the meeting, the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, noted that the engagement with the marginal field awardees and leaseholders was for NUPRC to state the policy position on the 2020 Marginal Fields Bid Round (MFBR). Komolafe stated that this would enable successful awardees progress to field development phase in line with the PIA.\n\nHe stated that the marginal field initiative was conceived to entrench the indigenisation policy of the government in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to him, the objective is to promote indigenous participation, increase oil and gas reserves, as well as production, encourage capital inflow, generate employment, and build local capacity in the sector.\n\nKomolafe noted that relevant leaseholders had also been invited to the forum so that they could understand their roles and responsibilities as it affects the farm-out of the fields, which he said included facilitating the achievement of first oil in a collaborative manner.\n\nIn all, he reiterated that 57 fields were identified for the 2020 bid round exercise, and a total of 665 entities expressed interest, explaining that after extensive evaluation processes as laid down in the guidelines, 161 entities emerged as potential awardees.\n\nKomolafe explained that signature bonuses for 119 awards were fully paid, nine awards were partly paid for, and 33 awards had yet to be paid for, a situation he said had resulted in various challenges inhibiting the close-out of the exercise.\n\nHe told the awardees, \u201cThe marginal field guidelines provided for 45 days for the payment of signature bonus, which has since elapsed, and we have issued a public notice to that effect as well as notified the relevant potential awardees.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to inform you that concerted efforts are being made to ensure that the 2020 MFBR exercise is completed within the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nKomolafe stated that the NUPRC management on assumption of duty set up a committee to look into issues surrounding the bid round and come up with strategies to resolve them.\n\n\u201cAnd some of these issues include the formation of SPVs, equity participation, and part payments,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, the committee has had engagements with some awardees and would continue such meetings with another set of awardees slated for next week in Lagos.\n\nThe commission, he said, through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (ADRC) also offered an opportunity for co-awardees of marginal fields to resolve issues speedily and amicably.\n\nIn a presentation by Senior Technical Adviser to the Commission, Abel Nsa, he stated that aside indigenous participation, other objectives of the programme included promoting use of shared facilities, increasing oil and gas reserves, building technical capacity, generating employment, encouraging capital inflow, and increased production.\n\nThe NURPC noted that in 1999, two fields were awarded, 24 in 2003, one in 2006, one in 2007, two in 2010 and 57 in 2020, with 13 of the assets on land, eight on swamp and nine offshore, prior to 2020.\n\nIn the latest bid round, it stated that 665 applications were received, 540 were pre-qualified, 546 went through data prying, 450 went through data leasing, 482 submitted bids, while 161 were potentially awarded the marginal fields.\n\n\u201cIn all, 57 fields were awarded, 119 fully paid up, nine partially paid, 33 awardees failed to pay, while 247 had unsuccessful bids,\u201d the organisation indicated.\n\nOn the way forward, NURPC stated that fields where none of the awardees had made signature bonuses had been terminated, affirming that engagement with awardees and discussion on areas of conflict remain open.\n\nIn addition, the commission stated that it would take necessary measures to assist the awardees to take over the assets for development and to accelerate first oil find as soon as possible.\n\nThe NURPC team further took time out to address the concerns raised by the awardees, bordering on governance and operational matters of the SPVs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Orders refund to state\n\n\u2022It\u2019s victory for democracy, says Wike\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday declared as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional the direct allocations made by the federal government from the federation account to fund the Nigeria Police Trust Fund. Mohammed barred the federal government from further deductions from the federation account to fund agencies not listed in the 1999 Constitution for direct allocation.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, stated that the judgement was a resounding victory for democracy.\n\nThe court, in the judgment, held that Section 161 and Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution were glaringly breached by the federal government following the direct allocation from the federation account to the Police Trust Fund.\n\nThe suit challenging the continued deductions from the federation account to fund agencies belonging to the federal government was filed by the Rivers State Government.\n\nDelivering judgement, the court held that Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution was clear and unambiguous to the effect that only the federal, states and local governments shall be allocated fund directly from the federation account.\n\nThe court also held that Section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the federal government to justify the unlawful deductions from the federation account was inconsistent with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution which recognises only the federal, states and local governments.\n\nMohammed, while upholding the suit by Rivers State against the deductions, ordered that the fund belonging to Rivers State but used to fund the Nigeria Police Trust fund by the federal government should be refunded to the state.\n\nThe judge, however, declined to extend similar order of refund to the 35 remaining states on the grounds that they were not parties in the suit, adding that Rivers State, as the plaintiff in this matter, did not file it on behalf of others.\n\nThe court upheld all arguments of Joseph Daudu, who stood for Rivers State, that where the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their ordinary meanings.\n\nMohammed also agreed with Daudu that the federal government was completely wrong in the interpretation given to section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act to the effect that the Nigerian Police was established for the federal government alone and as such the funding should solely be on the shoulders of the federal government.\n\nRivers State in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/511/2020 and instituted on its behalf by former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Daudu, had challenged the decision of the federal government to allocate funds directly from the federation account to fund some of its agencies, stating that the decision violates section 162 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe Rivers State government also stated that the actions of the federal government deprived it substantial revenue from the federation account and, therefore, prayed the court to nullify the allocation from the federation account.\n\nThe plaintiff also claimed that the levies imposed on companies operating in Nigeria by the federal government, be paid directly to the Nigeria Police Force Trust Fund, instead of the federation account was also illegal.\n\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff that under the relevant laws, such levies were supposed to be paid directly to the federation account and not to any federal government agencies.\n\nThe judge held, \u201cI have carefully perused the issues raised by the plaintiff and I agree that no other person or entity is permitted to benefit direct fund allocation from the federation account.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the defendant to make direct fund allocation from the Federation Account is untenable as it runs contrary to section 162 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, which expressly stated that the federal government, state governments and local governments shall derive direct fund allocation from the federation account.\u201d\n\nDefendant in the matter were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF); Accountant General of the Federation; Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and Minister of Finance.\n\nHowever only the Attorney General of the Federation filled processes to defend the federal government\u2019s action.\n\nThe AGF had in his preliminary objection asked the Federal High Court to decline jurisdiction in the matter on the ground that such suit ought to be filed directly at the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the preliminary objection was dismissed by Mohammed on the ground that it was misplaced and absurd.\n\nMeanwhile, Wike hailed the ruling, noting that the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act, which the federal government relied on deduct funds from the Federation Account was in contravention of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cI have always told people, it is not whether you must win or not, but it is a matter of when you see issues that you think are in contravention of our constitution and other laws, there is nothing wrong for you to challenge it, so that the right thing can be done.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the money is given back to us, we can still on our own say police, we want to support you with this. But not the federal government arbitrarily deducting our money from the federation account and putting it to Police Trust Fund. I don\u2019t think that, that is right and I thank God that today the court has made a clear pronouncement on it.\u201d\n\nThe governor acknowledged that though the National Assembly was constitutionally empowered to enact laws, in enacting the Police Trust Fund Act, they went beyond their powers by contravening the provisions of the constitution.\n\nSpeaking further on the order of the court that the Rivers State government should be refunded the money deducted from its share to fund the police, Wike said the order would put an end to impunity.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe are happy that the court has said that they should refund us all the money deducted and, luckily, the principal parties, Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission, the Accountant General, Attorney General Office, they are all involved in the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Rivers State, but it is about the impunity, it is about the violation of the constitution, as if anybody can wake up one early morning and just decide to do one or two things, which is wrong. And I am happy that the decision we took, we are not wrong and I thank my legal team.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022To send supplementary appropriation to National Assembly\n\n\u2022Mandates finance ministry to reconcile payment with NNPC\n\n\u2022NLC knocks govt over 18-month timeline\n\n\u2022 IPMAN wants dilapidated refineries fixed\n\n\u2022Fayemi: Only 8 states benefiting from subsidy\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja; Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nA day after the federal government announced its plan to delay implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and retain payment of petrol subsidy for 18 months, the government yesterday approved N3 trillion for the new subsidy regime. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the sum at its weekly meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe N3 trillion now budgeted to sustain the payment of subsidy in 2022 alone, amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total of N17.126 trillion 2022 budget that was signed into law on the last day of 2021. Already, the approved 2022 budget has a deficit of N6.39 trillion, which is 37 per cent of the N17.126 trillion. This is a clear indication that the government may borrow more this year than it had earlier projected.\n\nThe N3 trillion approved by FEC is 55 per cent and 43 per cent of the capital component and recurrent expenditure of the 2022 budget, respectively.\n\nImplementation of the PIA, which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy, was initially meant to commence in February 2022, but it was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threat of protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the removal of subsidy was suspended on Monday.\n\nBut NLC, Lagos chapter, yesterday criticised the federal government\u2019s decision to recommend an 18-month extension of the PIA to the National Assembly.\n\nOn its part, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) urged the federal government to introduce palliatives to cushion the effect of subsidy withdrawal, irrespective of the postponement of the policy, as well as fix all the country\u2019s refineries.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said only about eight states were presently benefitting directly from petrol subsidy. Fayemi said this at a joint meeting between the state governors, NLC, and TUC over the fuel subsidy withdrawal.\n\nFEC yesterday mandated the Finance, Budget and National Planning Ministry to reconcile the fuel subsidy budget with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which prepared the estimate.\n\nThe council meeting presided by President Muhammadu Buhari also okayed the preparation of the 2022 Supplementary Budget, which would include the repeal of Clauses 10 and 11 of the Appropriation Act as well as incorporation of N103 billion removed by the lawmakers from the initial budget estimates, for submission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe decisions reached at the virtual FEC meeting were made public by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who briefed newsmen after the meeting.\n\nAhmed said a memo in respect of the additional funding provisions to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy request in the 2022 budget was presented for the council\u2019s consideration.\n\nShe said only N443 billion had been provided for in the 2022 budget to accommodate subsidy from January to June, but taking the prevailing economic realities, both locally and globally, into consideration, FEC proposed a year-long provision for the subsidy.\n\nAhmed said the request was considered by the council, which directed the ministry to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cYou would recall that in the 2022 budget, as appropriated, we have made a provision of N443 billion for subsidy for January to June. Having taken into account the current realities: increased hardship in the population, heightened inflation, and also that the measures that needed to be taken to enable a smoother exit from the fuel subsidy are not yet in place, it was agreed by Council that it is desirable to exit fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC has presented to the ministry a request for N3 trillion as fuel subsidy for 2022. What this means is that we have to make an incremental provision of N2.557 trillion to be able to meet the subsidy requirement, which is averaging about N270 billion per month.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the actual under-recovery that has been charged to the federation was N1.2 trillion, which means an average of N100 billion, but in 2022, because of the increased crude oil price per barrel in the global market, now at $80 per barrel, and also because an NNPC\u2019s assessment is that the country is consuming 65.7 million litres per day, now we\u2019ll end up with incremental cost of N3 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this has been considered by Council and we\u2019ve also been asked to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget, to also further discuss with NNPC on how to make provisions for this and how to rationalise this expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that her ministry had been directed to engage the NNPC with the possibility of bringing down the subsidy estimate.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe\u2019re going to engage NNPC to further interrogate the request that they presented with a view of trying to see how we can scale it down so that the country is not incurring N3 trillion for a fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe agreed with the view of governors, that there is a need to scale down on the size. So even as government is not immediately removing the fuel subsidy, we have to make sure that what the nation is incurring is efficient, and that it is real cost that has been consumed by the country.\u201d\n\nAhmed stated that the government would fund the N3 trillion subsidy regime through outstanding debts owed it by NNPC, which were being sorted out through on-going financial reconciliations with the company.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe have several reconciliations with NNPC, which is owing, in some cases, the government. So we want to be able to settle some of the subsidy costs through this reconciliation process.\n\n\u201cWhen we are done with that, whatever is left that we are not able to apply to what NNPC is owing the federation will not be increasing the deficit. And that means increased domestic borrowing. But we haven\u2019t finished with the issue of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAhmed further disclosed that FEC approved the 2022 Supplementary Budget to take care of areas that were overlooked by the National Assembly in approving the Appropriation Bill. She said FEC approved amendments to parts of the 2022 budget, which had initially been adjusted by the National Assembly during its legislative deliberations on the budget proposal submitted to it by the president in 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the approved amendment to be transmitted to the National Assembly will request to repeal clauses 10 and 11 concerning the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) operations in the 2022 budget and restore the N103 billion the lawmakers had removed.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe second memo we presented to Council today has to do with a request for approval of the 2022 Appropriation Amendment. If you recall, when the president signed the 2022 appropriation into law on the 31st of December, he raised some concerns that he had in some of the provisions in the budget and had indicated that he will be submitting an amendment proposal to the National Assembly for them to effect improvements in what has been done to the budget.\n\n\u201cSo, today Council took that amendment proposal and I just want to report that part of the requests that Council has approved today is for the National Assembly to repeal clauses 10 and 11. Clause 10 is referring to a provision that has been made that will enable the EFCC and NFIU be able to take 10 per cent of whatever collections that they recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for that to be repealed because this is in direct contrast to the Acts of these two agencies and also it is in contravention of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the Finance Act 2021.\n\n\u201cClause 11, on the other hand, is a provision that has been made that says that the Nigeria embassies and missions are now authorised by this Appropriation Act to expend funds allocated to them under Capital Components without the need to seek approval of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This, again, Council agreed, is inconsistent with financial regulations and also inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act. So, we are asking for this to be repealed.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved that some of the changes that were made in the Appropriation Act, totalling N103 billion, should be restored and examples of these are N22 billion that was provided for sinking fund to mature bonds that will be ready for payment in 2022 in the Nigerian domestic market, and also N12 billion for counterpart funding that is required for the various rail projects, and N189 million to be adjusted also in the budgets of the Ministry of Transport, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThese are projects that are provided in these ministries that are completely unrelated to their mandate, so implementation will be a problem. Also, N5 billion to be restored for non-regular allowances of the Nigerian Navy, N15 billion to be restored for the regular allowances of the police formations and police commands and several others that Council looked at in detail.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a detailed schedule of this N103 billion that Mr. President will be formally conveying to the National Assembly to restore the adjustments that were made.\u201d\n\nAhmed also disclosed that FEC ratified an instrument on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis has to do with the confirmation of ratification of Customs Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement between South Africa and Nigeria and the purpose for us is for the customs law in the respective territories to be properly observed to prevent and also enhance investigation and to combat customs offenses and to afford each country mutual assistance in cases concerning the delivery of documents regarding the application of customs laws in two countries.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this for us is cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa, as it has become even more important now with the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. It will also help to increase trade relations between the two countries and facilitate exchange of information as well as strengthen our bi-national cooperation.\u201d\n\nNLC Knocks FG for Proposing 18 Months Extension\n\nNLC said the federal government was only postponing the evil day. Chairperson of NLC, Lagos Chapter, Agnes Sessi, spoke yesterday on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a programme on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers. Sessi said government had been very deceitful, as it had never fulfilled its promises to Nigerians regarding the maintenance of the refineries.\n\nShe stated that successive governments had deceived the populace into believing that they had to subsidise petrol.\n\nSessi said, \u201cWe need a concerted effort to fight the problem of corruption in our society, we thought it could be better during this administration, but it is getting worse. Everybody needs to speak and kill the slogan, which says if you cannot beat them, you join them.\n\n\u201cWe are not supposed to join them because successive governments have been unable to do the turnaround maintenance, despite the huge amount of money they have spent.\u201d\n\nDefending accusations that the NLC was engaged in smuggling of petrol, Sessi insisted it was simply blackmail because they chose not to be a part of the evil plans.\n\nShe advised that people should stop shifting the blame to labour, saying the unions are only a fraction of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because government has seen the kind of mobilisation and that we were serious, that is why they made a U-turn and reversed their decision that would have caused problems and pushed Nigerians to the highest level of economic downturn,\u201d Sessi concluded.\n\nOn his part, the Director General (DG) of Micheal Imodu Institute of Labour Studies, Issa Aremu, commended the leadership of NLC for remaining focused and for keeping to the tradition of the movement of engaging policies.\n\nAccording to Aremu, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this process so I know what it takes to mobilise and demobilise. I am happy that inclusive issues of development are up for discussions.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI am happy that we are all on the same page and it can be business as usual within the petroleum downstream sector.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long drawn issue and I think additional 18 months cannot be too long for us to look at all the issues as we are looking at nation building and not the regime. We shouldn\u2019t be a debating but functional society.\u201d\n\nHe called on the relevant stakeholders to stop hoarding petroleum products while the transition process is being managed.\n\nThe director general insisted that labour should be a little more balanced, saying the government had retained jobs and paid salaries as and when due.\n\nIPMAN Wants Dilapidated Refineries Fixed\n\nNational Operations Controller, IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, reiterated their support for the federal government in whatever decisions they made. Osatuyi noted that the 18 months suspension would give the government the avenue to put in palliatives and support for Nigerians.\n\nOsatuyi also clarified the notion about the group being government agents, stating that they are an association of businessmen who condemn subsidy.\n\nIPMAN, in a statement, appealed to the federal government to give priority to the revitalisation of the four refineries in the country ahead of the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\nPresident of IPMAN, Alhaji Debo Ahmed, in the statement, also appealed to the federal government to ensure the availability of petroleum products to the NNPC depots across the country. He stated that selective supply to private depots was, \u201cmaking it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN president restated his association\u2019s demand for payment of outstanding Bridging Claims owed marketers by the defunct Petroleum Equalisation Fund, now operating under the name, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe leadership of IPMAN commends the federal government for the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy. We reiterate our position that the four nations\u2019 refineries be repaired and allowed to function optimally before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call on the federal government to resume the supply of petroleum products to NNPC depots nationwide as against the selective supply to private depots, making it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\n\n\u201cOur huge funds are tied up with PPMC Ltd, a subsidiary of NNPC, where members pay for NNPC products supplied to their depots. We are equally pleading that marketers transportation claims be paid to allow members remain afloat in business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fayemi told the governors\u2019 meeting with NLC and TUC that only about eight states benefitted from the federal government\u2019s fuel subsidy.\n\nParticipants at the meeting called on the federal government to constitute a forensic examination on the activities of the NNPC. They alleged that the national oil company was bandying falsehood in terms of the amount being spent on petrol subsidy.\n\nThe meeting, which was held at the NGF secretariat, Abuja, brokered a partnership between the NGF and labour.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the meeting, Fayemi argued that the country\u2019s economy was at a precipice and, \u201cit has become necessary for the two groups to carefully verify all of NNPC\u2019s estimates to ensure that whatever action is taken on subsidy, it would be the people that get direct benefits and not a few wealthy individuals and their cronies in the country.\u201d\n\nFayemi told the labour leaders that subsidy removal had remained an on-gong conversation, not just among governors, but also the country at large.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor stated that, \u201cThere are raging questions of accountability associated with subsidy removal in the country and observed that the NGF and the NLC can jointly work together to proffer solutions that heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman had led to the meeting the delegation of governors, which included Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State, who is also chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. He stressed that all the countries surrounding Nigeria, including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana, had their fuel pump price in dollar equivalent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian musician Buju wanted to reward his fans, so he created an NFT project",
          "text": "Towards the end of 2020, project lead of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d, Iyobosa Rehoboth, a creative director of Global Creative Operations (GCO), started brushing up on his knowledge of crypto. After learning extensively about ethereum and NFTs, he started selling the idea of an NFT project to several Nigerian music artistes.\n\nThe award-winning music director, popularly known as Prodigeezy, had initially created a design for a joint NFT project for the trio of Nigerian music superstars, Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy, but when he realised that getting the three of them to collaborate on something would be difficult, he abandoned the project.\n\nRehoboth presented his design to some other artistes, who rejected it, until he got it to a Nigerian musician, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju. \u201cBuju was open-minded. Having made tremendous progress with his career that year, he was keen on making his brand a global one,\u201d Prodigeezy said. Buju was also, at the time, working on a comic book idea, so it was fairly easy to convince him.\n\nBuju released the remix of \u201cItaly\u201d, featuring Blaq Diamond, with a colourful artwork of his head as the song\u2019s cover. He didn\u2019t want to release a full song, so he uploaded \u201cItaly\u201d to multiple streaming platforms. Before he knew it, it was making waves and, unknown to his many fans jamming to the song, the colourful art cover is in fact an unreleased NFT project.\n\nBuju had seen the NFT project as an opportunity to build a community around his fans, reward and connect with them like never before. \u201cI feel like it is something that people are going to enjoy. I\u2019m always working on a lot of recordings. I feel like it is the best way I could reward people that enjoy my music,\u201d Buju said.\n\nThis Sunday, on a Twitter Space, Buju and the team behind the project offered more details about his NFT project \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201c, a collection of 10,001 unique NFTs of his face. Holders of these NFTs would get perks like access to physical and virtual concerts hosted by Buju, merch items, and a part of the revenue the musician makes from specific music projects.\n\nBuju explained that he would drop more songs, mixtapes, and refixes, and that the project would motivate him to drop some of the songs he has been recording for years now. Buju said that he is always dropping snippets and imagines that holders of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d will be able to claim ownership of some of the snippets he drops.\n\nHe said that while he hasn\u2019t decided the arrangement for the sharing revenue with holders, holders will have a fraction of ownership of some of his songs, which will allow them to earn part of his streaming revenue.\n\nThe roadmap for the project, whose Discord channel has close to 4,500 members, is divided into 3 quarters for this year. More plans will be provided in quarter 1of 2023.\n\nfloats, an extended reality company under GCO, which is building the project, will start and intensify an educational campaign to teach people the fundamentals of blockchain, onboard people into crypto, help them set up a wallet, and educate them about the polygon network.\n\nIn this quarter, the \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d project will be minted publicly and pre-sale will start. It is then holders will begin to get some of the perks of the project. This includes access to PlaySpace, an AR filter for Snapchat and Instagram that takes users through Buju\u2019s career and also offers access to special events and interaction with Buju. Some of the other perks are an airdrop and a life membership mic that unlocks more possibilities in the metaverse and in real life.\n\nIn the second quarter, when Buju announces the release of his debut album, another limited collection of NFTs will be released, which will help holders unlock special access to Buju\u2019s concerts, events, and studio sessions. Merch items with virtual and physical utility will also be released, and some of the virtual merch will contain unlockable NFT content.\n\nThe HeadsByBuju project will dedicate 10% of its primary sales to a creator fund, and the entire community of holders will vote to decide what kind of creative project it would be. This creator fund will also be used to purchase some land in metaverses like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels.\n\nTo ensure that holders reap real-world benefits, the project is collaborating with restaurants, clubs, hotels, and health centres to provide discounts for holders.\n\nThe \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d team wants to build the project on the polygon network, instead of the ethereum network\u2014which NFT projects are usually based on\u2014because they want to get as many people as possible onboarded to the blockchain. While developing the project, the team spoke with prospective users and discovered that the biggest problem to getting onboarded into the space was ethereum\u2019s high gas fees\u2014the amount of money you pay to execute any command on the ethereum network. So, to make onboarding easier for their audience, some of whom are interacting with NFTs for the first time, they said they want a popular and efficient marketplace and less expensive protocol, and polygon ticked all the boxes.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time any African musician has tried to use crypto technology to establish a connection with fans and reward them.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201d roHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health Insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that it does not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us it is a synergy having a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, their partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving them healthcare to them or covering them as part of their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that people use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy produce up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spend.\n\nSince its inception 4 months ago, over 7000 lives and 500 businesses actively use roHealth for making their health coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Amirah graduated from the Obafemi Awolowo University, she found it difficult to get a job despite her second class upper grade in economics. Six months into her search, she was getting frustrated. While hanging out with friends, one suggested that she start a tailoring business. As a student, she had made most of her dresses and even made some for her friends.\n\nThey were confident she could build a business out of her skill. But there was a problem. She needed to get a sewing machine but had burnt through her savings during her job search. She could ask her friends for a loan, but like her, they were also broke.\n\nWhile this is a fictional story, it paints a picture of numerous people in emerging markets like Nigeria. For Amirah, she could take out a loan, but only a few financial institutions would offer her one.\n\nAccess to credit is crucial for the growth of an economy. It gives access to consumers who would otherwise have been unable to afford certain products. However, no one gives out loans for fun. Financial institutions need to get these loans back with interest after a certain period and without a good enough guarantee of that, they will desist from granting these loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has been the case in Nigeria, where commercial banks have shied away from granting loans to most people but instead focused on a few high net worth individuals. In the past few years, fintech startups like Carbon and FairMoney have sprung up looking to solve this problem using proprietary technology.\n\nWhile some focus on lending, others embed it as a part of their service offerings. Still, one similarity is their use of technology to determine the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans.\n\nImproving access to credit for underserved markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all organisations have this capability, and this is where Periculum believes it has found its sweet spot. Like many Nigerians have done in the past few years, Michael Temitope Collins moved to Canada for his university education, where he studied business administration and management at Thompson Rivers University.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at a couple of Canadian banks and started a few businesses himself. While working at these banks, he researched and discovered many underserved customers, even in Canada.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nHis research also showed that one reason for the problem was the inability of financial institutions to assess individuals and their creditworthiness accurately. With this knowledge, he built a solution \u2014 Periculum \u2014 using existing financial and non-financial datasets.\n\nThe startup, launched in 2019, has seen some traction, getting into Techstars Toronto in 2021 and raising a pre-seed round of $620,000 from investors such as Loyal VC, First Fund, and White Hibiscus Capital, which Collins says exceeded their initial goal of $500k. Although the startup has clients across three continents \u2014 Africa, South America, and North America \u2014 it plans to focus on Nigeria in the interim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to build out a separate entity in Nigeria and focus strictly on the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market is unique; it\u2019s not a market where you can operate remotely.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing this plan, the startup has hired Damilola Aluede as managing director to head its Nigerian division.\n\nAccess to credit facilities provides businesses and individuals with numerous benefits. Businesses can scale and unlock demand using credit like M-KOPA and Daystar Power do. On the part of the customers, they can access products and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nHowever, getting credit is difficult for both individuals and businesses in Nigeria. According to Business Day, seven in ten bank customers in Nigeria lack access to credit. In the same vein, only 4% of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the country have access to credit. Therefore, providing a way for banks and lending institutions to assess creditworthiness will increase access.\n\nThe startup has also signed up a few customers in Nigeria, including Lendaba, Sycamore, Golden Ox Partners, Vola Africa, Venero, and Fundii. It also has a working arrangement with API fintech, Mono.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing technology to predict the creditworthiness of a customer is great in theory. However, doing this requires data that is notoriously hard to collect in Nigeria. Unsurprisingly, Collins points out that this is their biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get good data sources is a big challenge in Nigeria. A lot of our data partners have specific customers, so their customers are just a small group of customers compared to the whole. So the challenge now is for us to try and find different ways to get data or the ability to assess the creditworthiness of the large majority that are not involved in the economy.\u201d\n\nTo solve this problem, Collins discloses that Periculum will be making use of existing data such as the NIN and BVN for customers who are already involved in the economy. For those who are not, the plan is to draw on data from mobile transactions.\n\nBusiness model and key differentiator\n\nPericulum can make money in two major ways \u2014 a credit analytics and data analytics service to businesses. Consequently, the startup can charge its customers for API calls or a subscription fee.\n\nPericulum is not the only African startup trying to solve this problem. In addition to the lending startups mentioned above, there is also Toju and CARMA. However, Collins believes that their data analytics solution gives them the edge over their competitors.\n\n\u201cA lot of our competitors do one thing, maybe a couple of things, but we do multiple things. We don\u2019t just provide a credit scoring system; we do a lot of data analytics as well. In fact, our core business proposition is data analysis.\u201d\n\nAs the government and private sector work to improve the economy, increasing access to credit facilities for individuals and businesses will be key. However, challenges such as a lack of uniformity in data collection remain, and startups that can work around them could be successful while unlocking pathways to wealth for more Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "There\u2019s more to crypto than buying low and selling high",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin was at an all-time high (ATH) of $68,000; it was definitely a great time to be in crypto. At times like that, crypto traders and evangelists seize every opportunity to remind everyone who isn\u2019t into crypto trading what they are missing.\n\nHowever, it is a different story on the crypto streets as Bitcoin is bleeding out. The flagship crypto has lost almost half of what it gained during the ATH of 2021, and the charts remain crimson red.\n\nThe continuous nosedive has wiped out $1 trillion from the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor those who are not new to the extreme volatility that comes with trading or hodling crypto, the current decline is just one of those things. For Ruth Iselema, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange, Bitmama, the current dip in crypto prices isn\u2019t so much of a bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselema revealed this at Techpoint Build 2021 while speaking on the topic, Crypto beyond trading. She touched on other use cases of cryptocurrencies besides trading and how they could be very important to finance in Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s more to crypto than trading\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculative purposes, buying low and selling high, but they weren\u2019t originally created for speculation. According to the white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the essence of Bitcoin is to provide a \u201csystem for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nToday, Bitcoin trading is more or less a career path for some, an edge against inflation and the light at the end of the poverty tunnel. According to Iselema, cryptocurrencies are viewed this way, especially in Africa, because of the high poverty rate.\n\nAround 40% of Africa\u2019s population \u2014 1.3 billion \u2014 lives in extreme poverty, making crypto trading a very attractive venture. Iselema also pointed out that crypto trading is more popular among other use cases because of the complexities of using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBringing crypto into regular finance\n\nFrom lending, insurance, and exchange of value, cryptocurrencies have other use cases beyond trading. All these are classified under decentralised finance (DeFi), financial activities performed on decentralised networks.\n\nWhen it comes to alternative use of cryptocurrencies, DeFi paints a very vivid picture. It allows crypto to perform the same function as traditional financial institutions with fiat currencies, but, of course, without the need for those institutions.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe goal of DeFi is to create a financial system without third parties. It does this through decentralised peer-to-peer networks. This means anyone without an Internet connection can lend, trade, and borrow without the usual documentation in centralised finance.\n\nThere are several DeFi protocols such as Compound that provide crypto lending and borrowing services. People who have crypto will make it available to those who want to borrow. Collateral can be provided in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other crypto assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart contracts are an essential part of DeFi as they ensure that every party holds up its end of the bargain. As opposed to lending apps that hassle borrowers after they default on payment, smart contracts immediately carry out the action that was agreed upon if the borrower defaults on payment.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also another interesting use case for crypto. From buying valuable art or music to creating one, NFTs have been a life-changer for Africans and many across the globe.\n\nThere\u2019s still a high barrier\n\nWhile these use cases seem simple enough on the surface, there is a high educational barrier to using them. According to blockchain research tool, Dune Analytics, there are 4 million unique DeFi addresses as of January 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that one person can have up to 10 addresses, and the actual users of DeFi protocols could be less than half of the number of existing addresses. This means that not even a fraction of the global population uses DeFi protocols.\n\nWhile Africa might be the home of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, it\u2019s still behind in alternative crypto usage such as DeFi. In Statista\u2018s ranking of 20 countries with the most DeFi interactions, only one African country \u2014 Togo \u2014 made the list, ranking 20th.\n\nThis can be owed to the fact that many DeFi platforms are complicated and expensive to use. Blockchain expert Oluchi Enebeli believes that the blockchain space is still largely composed of engineers and developers who do not pay much attention to design and simplicity.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been touted as the path to financial freedom, crypto usage can be very costly, thus creating a financial barrier. Transactions on the Ethereum network, the most popular network for alternative crypto usage, cost a lot. For context, transaction costs could be higher than the value of the transaction.\n\nWhile there are new networks, Solana and Polygon, for instance, springing up and reducing the cost of crypto usage, only time will tell if alternative crypto usage will catch on in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "MTN Nigeria grows full year profit by 45.5% to N298.7bn",
          "text": "MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria) on Friday January 28 announced its audited results for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe leading telecommunications company\u2019s Mobile subscribers decreased by 8 million to 68.5 million but returned to positive net additions in fourth quarter (Q4) 2021. Active data users increased by 1.7 million to 34.3 million. Active fintech subscribers rose by 4.8 million to 9.4 million. Service revenue increased by 23.3% to N1.7 trillion.\n\nKey metrics:\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 27.9percent to N877.1 billion. EBITDA margin increased by 2.1 percentage points (pp) to 53 percent.\n\nProfit after tax (PAT) grew by 45.5percent to N298.7 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 45.5percent to N14.67 kobo. It proposed final dividend of N8.57 kobo per share. MTN Nigeria also reported enhanced guidance for service revenue growth of \u201cat least 20percent\u201d over the medium term.\n\nMTN Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s largest providers of communications services, connecting approximately 68 million people in communities across the country with each other and the world.\n\nGuided by a belief that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life, MTN Nigeria\u2019s leadership position in coverage, capacity and innovation has remained constant since its launch in 2001.\n\nMTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group \u2013 a multinational telecommunications group, which operates in 20 countries in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nKarl Toriola, MTN Nigeria CEO, said: \u201c2021 was a significant year for our Company. We commemorated our 20th anniversary with a celebration of our customers and all the stakeholder relationships that enabled our journey. In addition, we made good progress towards our Ambition 2025 objectives, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the business. This reflects the firm foundations on which our business is built, the tenacity and commitment of our people, and the support of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to deepen our contributions to society in line with our priority to enhance shared value. During the year, our total contribution to the Government through direct and indirect taxes was N669.2 billion, up 83.4percent, representing approximately 40percent of our total revenue. We extended our interventions, in response to the challenges to our nation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a further N1.5 billion to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) in support of efforts aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. This is supplementary to other interventions to protect the health and well-being of our people, customers and stakeholders. We also worked hard across our business to embed new ways of working while harnessing the opportunities presented by the trends in digital adoption,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cIn line with our objective to share our Company\u2019s success with our various stakeholders, the first phase of a series of transactions to increase Nigerian ownership in MTN Nigeria was conducted during 2021 by way of bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price offer to retail investors (the Offer). The outcome of the Offer will be announced once regulatory approvals have been obtained.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we committed to participating in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit scheme to rehabilitate the Enugu-Onitsha expressway, with ongoing engagement to kick off the project. We signed a five-year deal to support the Nigerian Football Federation as the official communications partner and actively supported the Super Eagles\u2019 participation in the African Cup of Nations competition. We are also committed to designing and constructing a new, world-class corporate headquarters,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nOperationally, our mobile subscriber base declined by 10.6percent and was impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations. However, we are pleased to have returned to positive growth in Q4 2021, adding approximately 1 million subscribers as we continued to ramp up the alignment of our SIM registration and activation centres with the regulations.\n\n\u201cActive data subscribers rose by 5.3percent YoY to 34.3 million as we continued to drive data conversion from our existing subscriber base. To enable this, we significantly enhanced our connectivity infrastructure with the acquisition of an additional 800MHz spectrum and the accelerated rollout of our 4G network, which now covers more than 70percent of the population.\n\nFurthermore, we were successful in our bid to acquire a 100MHz spectrum licence in the 3.5GHz band, on which we will roll out 5G services, at the auction held in December 2021. 5G provides the foundation on which future network performance will be built. Our successful bid presents an exciting opportunity to be at the forefront of delivering technological advancements to as many Nigerians as possible,\u201d noted further.\n\n\u201cOur fintech business continued to gain traction with approximately 770,000 registered mobile money (MoMo) agents and active users more than doubling to 9.4 million. This provides a solid foundation on which to launch the MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB), for which we have received an Approval in Principle. The MoMo PSB will provide a powerful platform to drive digital and financial inclusion in Nigeria. In recognition of our progress in the fintech space, we received a $500,000 grant from the African Development Bank to fund research on financial inclusion for women.\n\n\u201cDriven by the strong operational performance, we delivered growth across all revenue lines, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business. Service revenue grew by 23.3percent, exceeding our mid-teen target, driven mainly by growth in voice, data and fintech service revenue lines.\n\n\u201cEBITDA rose by 27.9percent, while our EBITDA margin expanded by 2.1pps to 53percent, in line with our Ambition 2025 objective. This was driven by solid revenue growth on the back of accelerated investments in our network, supported by cost management initiatives through our expense efficiency programme. Overall, these efficiencies translated into an increase of 46.1percent in Profit Before Tax and 45.5percent in Profit After Tax.\n\nIn line with our dividend policy, the board has proposed a final dividend of N8.57 kobo per share to be paid out of distributable net income. This brings the total dividend for the year to N13.12 kobo per share, representing an increase of 39.6percent.\u201d\n\nKey financial highlights\n\nVoice revenue includes interconnect and outbound roaming voice; Data revenue includes roaming data; Digital revenue excludes bulk SMS and USSD services; Fintech revenue includes MTN Xtratime and mobile financial services; Other service revenue includes SMS, USSD, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) & infrastructure and devices; while Free cash flow (EBITDA minus capital expenditure) excluding IFRS 16 impact was N430.7 billion, up 31.1 percent.\n\nOperational review\n\nService revenue grew by 23.3percent despite the 10.6percent decline in our subscriber base. Data continued to lead service revenue growth, supported by voice, fintech and digital service.\n\nVoice revenue grew by 8.4percent due to higher usage in MTNN active SIM base, resulting in a 7.9percent growth in minutes of use. This was supported by the success of customer value management (CVM) initiatives, reducing the impact of SIM registration and activation restrictions in H1 and network restrictions in some locations towards the end of 2021. In addition, MTNN continues to ramp up gross connections through its rural telephony initiatives while expanding its customer acquisition points, further supporting growth in voice revenue.\n\nData revenue rose by 55.3percent, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory in Q4 as MTNN continues to accelerate the expansion of our 4G coverage, enhance the quality and capacity of its network to support increasing data traffic, and grow active data users. Average MB per user rose by 62.7percent, enabling overall data traffic growth of 85.3percent. Also, smartphone penetration on the network grew by 4.0pp to 50percent. MTNN 4G network now covers 70.3percent of the population, up from 60.1percent in December 2020.\n\nFintech revenue rose by 57.3percent due to sustained growth in the use of its Xtratime product and broader fintech services by our customers. MTNN expanded its MoMo agent network, through its one distribution strategy, with the addition of over 374,000 registered agents bringing the total number to approximately 770,000, up 94.8percent. As a result, transaction volume rose by 167percent to 137.5 million from an active user base of 9.4 million, up 102percent. Additionally, the Approval in Principle we recently obtained in relation to our MoMo PSB licence application is an important step towards final approval, which will allow MTNN to expand its service offerings and scale its fintech business, thereby achieving more meaningful financial inclusion in the country.\n\nDigital adoption continues to accelerate as customers use more digital products and services, a trend accelerated by COVID-19. As a result, digital revenue grew by 61.2percent as the active user base grew and penetration of MTNN digital products deepened. The active user base rose by 162.1percent to 7.5 million, led by Ayoba \u2013 its instant messaging platform \u2013 with approximately 3.8 million active users, up 172.9percent.\n\n\u201cEnterprise business performance was underpinned by the onboarding of new customers across our key segments and the uptake of our enhanced services. As a result, service revenue from enterprise business was up by 12percent. We are pleased with the implementation of the new pricing framework for USSD services which will pave the way for full recovery of the outstanding debts.\n\nOn the costs side, we made good progress with our expense efficiency programme through which we realised N25.1 billion in cost savings, representing a 1.5pp margin impact. However, the continued effects of Naira depreciation on lease rental costs, acceleration in our site rollout, and the ongoing COVID-19 related expenditure resulted in operating expenses increasing by 21.9percent.\n\nRead also: MTNN public offer: Subscribers allotment likely in February\n\nDespite this, our ability to drive operating leverage has enabled EBITDA growth of 27.9percent and the expansion of our EBITDA margin by 2.1pp to 53percent.\n\n\u201cWe recorded sustained increase in the demand for data, which extended beyond the usage spikes seen during COVID lockdowns. This drove our acceleration of capex investment. As a result, capex in the period was up by 36.7percent to N408.3 billion, as we ramped up investment in our network to capture growth through service quality leadership and aggressive coverage expansion, focusing on the 4G network. We deployed 9,336 4G sites representing approximately 75percent of the total sites deployed during the period, reflecting solid data revenue growth.\n\n\u201cWe recorded healthy free cash flow of N468.8 billion, up by 21.1percent, substantiating the quality of our ramped-up investment. Core capex excluding the right of use assets rose by 26.8percent to N304.4 billion, while capex intensity remained within target levels at 18.4percent. Depreciation and amortisation rose by 12.9 percent because of the impact of increased site rollout.\n\nAlthough net finance costs increased by 15.8percent due to higher borrowing, the average cost of borrowing declined by 2.1pp. As part of our strategy to optimise our capital structure, we tapped into the debt capital market and raised N200 billion in bonds across two oversubscribed issuances. The bonds issued enabled us to diversify funding sources, extend the maturity profile of the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and optimise funding costs.\n\nUpdate on New SIM Registration Directive\n\nMTNN continues to actively support the Federal Government\u2019s National Identity Number (NIN) enrolment programme, having deployed more than 2,300 points of enrolment across the country.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we continued to work with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to accelerate the bulk verification of NINs collected. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 44 million subscribers have submitted their NINs, representing around 64percent of our subscriber base and 74percent of service revenue.\n\n\u201cThe current deadline for NIN verification is 31 March 2022. While an extension is solely in the hands of the authorities, we are working constructively with them and the industry, supporting the NIN enrolment drive, to ensure that customers are not unduly inconvenienced and service revenue for 2022 is not impacted\u201d.\n\nOutlook\n\nMTNN is focused on building on the platform of success laid in 2021.\n\n\u201cOur return to positive subscriber net additions in Q4 2021 establishes a solid basis for growth in 2022 as we ramp up gross connections through our rural connectivity drive and CVM initiatives. As part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 2,000 new communities in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing structurally sustained data growth. As a result, we are investing in network and information technology infrastructure, and have secured the relevant frequencies to meet the higher demand. This involves accelerating the expansion of our 4G coverage and providing home broadband to capture a significant share of market growth. We will commence the initial rollout of 5G services once the acquisition process is completed to further deepen broadband penetration in Nigeria, enhance customer experience and unlock new revenue streams.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant progress with our super-agent licence, expanding the agent network across the country.\n\nHowever, as the business transits to MoMo PSB once the final approval is obtained, we remain focused on developing the range of additional services we can offer customers to drive digital and financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe will sustain our drive for cost management across the business through our expense efficiency programme and strengthen our operations and financial position to unlock efficiency and support margins. Although the availability of foreign exchange remains a constraint, we strive to minimise its impact on the business, \u201d the Telco said.\n\nMedium-term Guidance\n\nIn line with the accelerated growth MTNN is seeing, \u201cwe expect service revenue growth of \u201cat least 20 percent\u201d over the medium term. In delivering on the service revenue growth guidance, we will continue to focus on capex efficiencies, margin expansion, operating cashflow growth and improving returns to shareholders\u201d, Toriola noted.",

The companies issued a combined N 245.62 billion worth of commercial paper.\n\n\u201cAn era of low-interest rate is the best time for companies to restructure their debt and access lower finance cost to grow their bottom line,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Mg, states.\n\nCompared to two years ago when the interest rate was at a record high of over 15 percent, the current single-digit interest rate means lower financing costs for corporates that are borrowing to finance their operations.\n\nAnalysis of the FMDQ data showed that the 16 companies that issued the commercial paper in the review period did so at an average of 10.03 percent, 6.97 percentage points less than the average inflation rate of 17 percent reported in 2021.\n\nIf the companies were to go to banks to borrow the kind of funds they raise through CP, they would have paid at least 15 percent interest. That is even because they are big institutions. If it were smaller companies, they probably would have obtained the funds at an interest rate of between 18 to 20 percent or more.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), the benchmark against which other lending rates in the economy are pegged, is currently at 11.5 percent. The apex bank has consistently retained the same rate since September 2020.\n\nAlso known as an unsecured short-term debt instrument issued by large corporations to raise funds to meet short term financial obligations, commercial papers are issued within a short period, usually between 15-270 days. While commercial papers are issued by companies, Treasury bills are issued by the government.\n\nRead also: Investors\u2019 appetite for T-Bills dampens as low-interest rate persists\n\nYields on the government Treasury Bills (T-Bills), the benchmark for determining the interest rate corporates pay investors for borrowing their money, remained relatively low in 2021.\n\nAfter crashing to a four-year low of near-zero percent in 2020, yields on the Federal Government risk-free Treasury bill jumped to more than 17 months-high of 9.75 percent on May 14.\n\nThe rate, however, plunged to an 11-month low of 4.9 percent at the last auction of 2021, as compiled from Nigerian treasury bills primary market auction results for December 29, 2021, an opportunity for both government and corporates as they raised capital at a lower cost.\n\nThe CPs are issued at a higher interest rate than T-Bills because of the absence of the full faith of the federal government.\n\nInterest rates, according to research analysts at Agusto & Co. will remain low in 2022 \u201cbecause we have an accommodating CBN willing to help the FGN borrow from the markets at rates below inflation.\u201d\n\nWhile the low-interest-rate environment in Nigeria\u2019s debt market has been a boon for large corporates who are raising capital at cheaper rates compared to bank loans, micro and small businesses, which form the bulk of firms in the country, are left out.\n\nLack of proper documentation and inability to meet listing requirements are some of the reasons Nigerian small businesses are unable to tap the low-interest rate opportunity.\n\nBreakdown of the data by FMDQ showed that FSDH Merchant Bank raised N12 billion under its various CP Issuance Programme in 2021. The lender also floated N19.6 billion and FSDH Funding SPV Plc, a special purpose vehicle set up to raise capital from the Nigerian debt capital market.\n\nOther corporates that also tapped the Nigerian capital market in 2021 include Total Nigeria, (N15 billion); Mixa Real Estate, (N13.36 billion); Valency Agro Nigeria, (N12.36 billion); FBNQuest Merchant Bank Limited, (N7.34 billion); Nigerian Breweries, (N4.66 billion); Prima Corporation Limited, (N3.57 billion); Eunisell Limited, (N3.50 billion); DLM Capital Group Limited, (N2.25 billion); while TrustBanc Holdings Limited, (N0.20 billion).",

          "text": "Micro, Small, and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria are left at the mercy of black market operators in accessing foreign exchange even after the central bank pulled the plug on supply to the operators and channelled supply to the commercial banks.\n\nCurrently, it costs N415 to get one dollar from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) while it costs about N550 in the parallel market, giving a difference of at least N135 per dollar.\n\nAlthough the black market (Bureau De Changes \u2013 BDCs) is much more expensive, it is a faster and less cumbersome process, and at the end of the day the dollar is always available with them, unlike commercial banks that do not have enough to go round.\n\nNigeria has 39.6 million MSMEs, 58.6 percent (23.23m) of these are involved in wholesale and retail trade, buying products abroad and selling them in Nigeria.\n\nAccess to foreign exchange, credit availability and regulatory policies have topped the challenges chart of MSMEs in Nigeria and have become multidimensional, and even more intense than previous years to the point where it is almost defying efforts to manage it.\n\nMost MSMEs deal in the sale of clothes, household kits, shoes, electronics, among others, primarily sourcing the products from China, Turkey, Dubai, the United States, etc. where the dollar serves as the dominantly accepted currency.\n\nConsequently, the unfavourable exchange rate and restricted access to the dollar continue to affect these businesses as they are forced to pay more for purchases, which erode their profits.\n\nRead also: Explainer: Reasons SMEs wait so long to get dollars\n\nThe containment efforts of the CBN through various policies and directives also seem to have widened the gap and worsened the situation, even though that was not the aim.\n\nFor instance, in August 2020, the CBN issued a directive that restricted third parties or middlemen from accessing the FX window through the Form M, this further tightened access to FX for small businesses.\n\nSince the directive, dollar availability from banks has not improved while the customers of black market operators have increased along with their orders.\n\nIbrahim Danjuma, a black market operator, says the market functions differently, at times it may be very busy and other times activities will be slow.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the market is not performing optimally. However, orders are still coming in although in little quantities. Since the ban customers have increased, particularly during the boom period,\u201d he states.\n\nBusinessDay found out that even top-tier banks do not have sufficient dollars to give out, hence they ask their customers to go to the black market operators for dollars.\n\nOluwole Adelana, financial director at a manufacturing firm, says when he wants to process international transactions and he is not pressed for time, he reaches out to the bank with the invoice from the supplier and other necessary documentation.\n\n\u201cWhen I apply for dollars, I fill the Form M and submit all the necessary documents then I wait for the request to be processed, which may take weeks or months. Once it is done my supplier is credited while the naira equivalent at CBN\u2019s rates and bank charges are deducted from the account,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe notes that although the banks use CBN\u2019s rates, the process is quite slow and cumbersome with so much accreditation and confirmation involved.\n\nA bank staff member who pleaded anonymity states that for MSMEs to access dollars from the bank, the business needs to have a corporate account and request for Form Q, along with a proforma invoice, financial statement, registration document, and some other documents that will be used to apply. If the application is successful, the bank credits the supplier but will not hand the dollar over to the entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no minimum amount that can be requested, businesses are only entitled to $20,000 per quarter,\u201d the source says.\n\nAkhuewu Jennifer, who owns Bliss & Bloom Nigeria, says even if the customer has a domiciliary account with the bank, you cannot make a deposit with naira equivalent, it has to be dollar, hence the bank will refer you to the BDC operators.\n\n\u201cI make payments using the naira debit card, WeChat, and other mobile applications where you can reach agents and suppliers directly. Due to the exchange rate, before making payment I compare the available rates of different suppliers and go with the most suitable one,\u201d she states.\n\nAsking if she tried using banks to pay directly, she says, \u201cIn 2021, I tried getting $2,500 from my bank directly so I can travel with it and sort out payments. It took them almost 10 days to even process it and I still did not get it despite presenting different documents. I had to go back to my agent to buy it even though it was much more expensive.\u201d\n\nWholesale and retail traders are not the only ones caught in the FX drawback. As of 2016, 54 manufacturing firms under the MSME cadre shut down operations simply because of the inability to get FX as well as the unfavourable exchange rate.\n\nMany more have followed since then with manufacturers saying they get two to 10 percent of their dollar needs from the banks even after waiting for 30-90 days.",

The event commemorated a civilian-led peace agreement made between the Islam and Catholic communities in Mindanao 8 years ago.\n\nBack in 2014, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international NGO mediated the conflict in Mindanao by proposing a peace agreement by local representatives. Witnessed by Chairman Man Hee Lee of HWPL, the peace agreement was signed by Hon. Esmael G. Mangudadatu, the then Governor of Maguindanao, and Archbishop-Emeritus Fernando Capalla of the Archdiocese of Davao representing local leadership. Since then, the province of Maguindanao and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) declared January 24 as \u201cHWPL Peace Day\u201d and have commemorated it as annual event to reaffirm international cooperation and local partnership for peacebuilding in Mindanao.\n\nMoreover, peace monuments were built honoring the peace agreement in Mindanao. The 1st and 2nd Peace Monuments were erected in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2021, the third peace monument was unveiled in Cotabato City. Being the first in Luzon, a peace monument in Dingras, Ilocos Norte was unveiled last January 24 as part of the 8th Anniversary event of the HWPL Peace Day celebration. Also, another monument located in Siniloan Integrated National High School is set to unveil on February.\n\nThe event, under the theme of \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and on Earth\u201d, aimed to promote interfaith harmony between religions and raise public support to establish international law for peace.\n\nKey figures gave congratulatory messages including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senator Panfilo Lacson, Senator Cynthia Villar, Senator Ronald \u2018Bato\u2019 Dela Rosa, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, and TV News Anchor Mariz Umali from the Philippines. Keynote speakers from various fields also presented commitment messages declaring their plans on promoting peace in their respective sectors including law, education, youth, women, private business and media.\n\nPrabhu Mahendra Das, Temple President of Sri Sri Radha Madhava Mandir, said that he decided to participate in the World Alliance of Religions\u2019 Peace (WARP) Office organized by HWPL as \u201ca global platform for religious leaders to talk, share, discuss, learn, and grow together harmoniously and peacefully.\u201d For the contribution to peace in the field of religion, he added, \u201cI firmly believe that all religions should enter into a partnership through the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d\n\nJustice Raoul Victorino (ret), Chairman of Philippine National Prayer Breakfast (PNPB) and Dean of the College of Law of Philippine Christian University (PCU), shared how he was inspired by the \u201crevolutionary movement\u201d that HWPL initiated to endorse global peacebuilding through the draft the \u201cDeclaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW)\u201d by global experts in international law to advocate peace as a global culture and norm. He declared, \u201cI will strive to get the support of the President of the Philippines for the National Solidarity Support of DPCW. At the same time, I will integrate DPCW [education] in the college of law by collaborating with the Philippine Association of Law Schools.\u201d\n\nAlso, representing the Philippines education sector, Commissioner Ronald Adamat of the Commissioner on Higher Education (CHED) shared, \u201cThe CHED Commission en Banc has issued an endorsement to President Duterte, urging him to declare January 24 as \u2018National Peace Day\u2019, that will provide for simultaneous celebration and observance of peace through peace activities, events, and ceremonies by all instrumentalities and agencies of government, including the private sector. This shall also be celebrated and observed in the education sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to bring all people in the world together to create a world of peace and leave it as a lasting legacy for future generations. To make this world a peaceful place without wars, let us become messengers of peace. Let us remind people around the world of that emotion\u2014a longing for peace\u2014and the Peace Day so they can remember all of this forever,\u201d said Chairman Lee during the closing remarks.\n\n[8th Anniversary of the January 24 HWPL Peace Day] \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and Earth\u201d\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PtBogiRkfFo\n\n...",

Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters. We urge the committee to go beyond conference room talk and paperwork to addressing real challenges militating against full harvesting of our marine environment benefits in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nNwabunike also called on Federal Government to ensure that it includes the ANLCA in some of its committees, saying \u201cAs a body of Customs Brokers, practitioners and investors,\u201d they have vast experience in trade matters\u201d.\n\n...",

          "text": "No fewer than 1,000 Islamic and Christian clerics including their followers, have drummed support for the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello\u2019s 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThe clergymen, during a one-day inter-faith prayer in Abuja on Friday, sought God\u2019s blessings upon Bello in order to take Nigeria to the promised land.\n\nConvener of the group, Bishop Praise Moses, who led the Christian prayer of faith and proclamation of the divine choice for 2023 presidential bid, said it was revealed by the Holy spirit and that they heard a voice from the wilderness, chanting loudly and calling on Governor Yahaya Adoza Bello to take over the mantle of leadership as Nigeria\u2019s next president in 2023.\n\nThe clerics also likened Bello to \u201cDavid\u201d, a biblical hero and man of valour who won all battles to emerge king of ancient kingdom of Israel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAnd in accordance with the directive of the Holy spirit, we have the rare privilege and honour to re-baptise him as we are gathered now. Therefore, on this divine mission and today Governor Bello will be known and called Yahaya Adoza \u201cDavid\u201d Bello henceforth. It has been prophesied and by the grace of God, through this prayerful intercessions, Yahaya Adoza David Bello is the anointed son who will lead Nigeria from May 2023 to great battles and God will give him victory over all adversaries.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is our prayers in solemn invocation of the invincible powers of God Almighty that as King David was taken from the sheepfolds and crowned King, so also will Yahaya Adoza \u201cDavid\u201d Bello emerge President of Nigeria in May 2023,\u201d Bishop Moses declared.\n\nHe added that \u201cThrough spiritual lenses, we are told to tell Nigerians that Governor Bello is armed to effectively battle insurgents, corrupt politicians, bandits, kidnappers and every other affliction in the land, that\u2019s the sacred declaration of the Lord in the year 2022.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we make this solemn proclamation that the over 1,000 clergymen and faithful who have converged on Abuja from every walks of life in this special inter-denominational and inter-religious conference of prayers are asking God Almighty to guide and protect Governor Bello as he steps out on this divine mission, I therefore, invite everyone of us to activate his spiritual weapons to protect this worthy cause until the divine mission is accomplished.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOffering Islamic prayers for the Kogi State governor, Sheik Mahmoud Abubakar said, \u201cMy brethren, Yahaya Bello is before us, he has displayed good conduct and we can vouch for his strength of character, we can also vouch for his sincerity of heart and purpose, hence our prayers and supplications to God for His mercies to shine and be with him and guide him as he journeys towards becoming the president of our great country in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe trust Governor Yahaya Bello to lead Nigeria in the right direction. We send our prayers on his behalf to Allah SWT. We are grateful, we are happy and we pray that once again, we shall all come back to this ground in the company of President Yahaya Bello to return all the glory and thanks to Allah SWT.\u201d",

They are the Orangun of Ila, Oba Abdul-Wahab Oyedotun; Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Adesola Ojo Fadipe; Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun Ibiloye and Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Omoniyi Adedokun Abolarinwa.\n\nThe monarchs who could not hide their feelings and enthusiasm while receiving Oyetola, lauded his leadership style and sterling performance in office, saying that he had done creditably well to earn another term in office. They also expressed confidence in the governor\u2019s capability to lead Osun to the promised land.\n\nThe royal fathers therefore urged their subjects, home and in the diaspora, to reciprocate the good works done by the Governor in the last three years by voting for him massively in the July governorship election.\n\nSpeaking at his palace, the Orangun of Ila, Oba Oyedotun, who applauded the good works of the Governor, said his achievements in the last three years were enough testimonies for him to be reelected.\n\nHe said with the support of God and people of the State, Oyetola will triumph over his detractors.\n\nOrangun further expressed gratitude to the Governor for prioritising the ancient town in the scheme of things as manifested in the good things that have come to the town such as the recently approved university sited in Ila-Orangun, among other developments that the town has witnessed since the inception of the present administration.\n\nHe assured the Governor of the maximum support of his subjects, adding that the entire Ila Federal Constituency would be delivered overwhelmingly for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to do everything humanly possible to ensure your victory, we are going to support you, we are going to ensure your victory and I am confident that my people will vote for you overwhelmingly.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of what you have done and your achievements are enough testimonies to earn you another term in office. Don\u2019t despair, our ancestors confronted travails and they emerged triumphantly, you shall overcome yours too. Your detractors will witness your success and you will triumph over them\u201d, Orangun assured.\n\nSimilarly, Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Adesola Ojo-Fadipe, said in the last three years, the Governor had not left anyone in doubt of his capacity to redefine and transform the State.\n\nHe stated further; \u201cGod brought you to power at the point of need, at a time the people of the State were yearning for socioeconomic stability. We thank God today that you have brought the desired change.\n\n\u201cYou have demonstrated your capacity to take us to the promised land. We thank you for all you have done, we have seen your modest achievements. Your infrastructural interventions, commitment to regular payment of salaries as well as the appointment of noble citizens particularly the indigenes of our town to government positions, are highly commendable.\n\n\u201cWe have been seeing all you are doing. You have restored peace to traditional council. We are receiving our entitlements regularly, not only that, you have taken our welfare and that of workers as priority.\u201d\n\nCorroborating this, the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun Ibiloye and Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Omoniyi Adedokun Abolarinwa, declared their support for the Governor saying \u201cto whom much is given, much is expected.\u201d\n\nIn his response, Governor Oyetola appreciated the monarchs for their prayers and support for him and his administration.\n\nHe assured that his administration would continue to prioritise the welfare of people of the State.\n\nAddressing leaders and members of the party at Ila-Orangun, Otan-Ayegbaju and Oke-Ila, Governor Oyetola urged them to safeguard their party\u2019s registration slip and permanent voter\u2019s card (PVCs) ahead of the forthcoming party\u2019s primaries and governorship election in the State.",

          "title": "Nigerians thumb down planned tax on carbonated beverages",
          "text": "\u2026Consider impact on citizens \u2013 Adefolarin \u2026Levies\u2019ll further hike prices of goods \u2013 Businessman \u2026It\u2019ll provoke industrial crisis, lead to job loss \u2013 NLC, LCCI \u2026It\u2019s not silver bullet, MAN declares \u2026FG needs to rebuild trust \u2013 Expert\n\nAs Nigerians were yet to properly digest the news by the minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, on the petrol subsidy, she threw another bombshell \u2013 the government will place taxes on carbonated drinks. In this report, BENJAMIN UMUTEME looks at the pros and cons of the proposed policy.\n\nIn August when the National Assembly declared that they would amend the Finance Act, following the argument by the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, that all beverage companies should be made to pay levies, not many gave it a thought. On that fateful day, Ali explained that non-alcoholic drinks were as harmful as alcoholic beverages, noting that there is a 30 per cent excise levy on alcoholic drinks.\n\n\u201cI have sung this song for many years now, Coca-Cola is produced in this country and it is not being taxed. There is nowhere in the world that Coca-Cola is not paying tax to its host country, but Coca-Cola in this country is not paying anything because of the government\u2019s unwillingness to re-excise those companies. For us, we have been battling for it, and I hope that one day, we will start collecting,\u201d he said.\n\nFast forward to January, 2022 and it is obvious the Customs boss has finally won.\n\nAt the public presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Act in Abuja, the finance minister disclosed that the federal government had introduced an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nExcise duty is a form of tax imposed on the production, licensing and sale of goods. According to her, the new policy introduced is in the Finance Act signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021.\n\nShe said the purpose of the additional tax was to discourage the consumption of excessive sugar among Nigerians, which, according to her, contributes to diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe minister further said the new measure was in line with the 2022 Budget priorities which enabled the government to introduce a new sugar tax to raise revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures. About four million Nigerians suffer from diabetes linked to excess sugar consumption.\n\nNigeria ranks the 4th highest soft drink consuming country globally, with over 40 million litres sold yearly.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere\u2019s now an excise duty of N10 per litre imposed on all non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages. And this is to discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages which contributes to a number of health conditions including diabetes and obesity. But it is also used to raise excise duties and revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures. This is in line also with the 2022 budget priorities.\u201d\n\nReactions\n\nThe minister had barely left the venue of the event when Nigerians started reacting to the government\u2019s move to implement a new tax regime. For many, the government was insensitive considering the difficult state Nigerians and businesses were in. For various business concerns, another tax would only increase the crushing burden they have been operating under for so long.\n\nThe impact many say is potential job loss and further increase in the prices of carbonated drinks many Nigerians lament is already on the high side.\n\n\u2018Long-awaited\u2019\n\nAs Nigerians were condemning the government\u2019s pronouncement, many more were excited about the decision. Reacting to the news, in an email to Blueprint, a non-governmental organisation, the Amaka Chiwuike-Uba Foundation (ACUF), described the introduction of a N10 per liter excise duty on soft drinks as \u201ca welcome development and legislation that has been long awaited.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ACUF Board chair, Dr. Chiwuike Uba, the partial introduction of Sin Tax will not only lead to a drastic decline in the consumption of potentially harmful goods (especially Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) ), but an increase in the government revenue as well as improvements in the population health.\n\n\u201cAccording to Statista, in 2019, Nigeria was the seventh largest country with the highest consumption of soft drinks in the world, with more than 49 servings of eight ounces per capita per year. By the way, the market is projected to grow by 17.12% per year between 2021 and 2026.\n\n\u201cMany studies have found that the recent rapid increase in early-onset colorectal cancer in adolescence and adulthood are largely attributed to the consumption of soft drinks. Consumption of two or more of these drinks per day exposes the consumer to double the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers before the age of 50 years. In 2020, there were more than 124,815 new cancer cases in Nigeria, including more than 78,899 related deaths,\u201d Dr. Uba said.\n\nHe said further that, \u201cAccording to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), treating diabetes per person has gone from an average cost of N60, 000 in 2011 to N300, 000 in 2021. This figure is also expected to exceed N500, 000 in 2030 and N1.0 million in 2045.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the financial burden of diabetic foot problem in terms of direct costs of treatment is above N2 million. The government must make every effort to deter the high consumption of these sugary and products harmful to health.\n\n\u201cAccording to IDF, diabetes-related healthcare expenditures in Nigeria in 2021 were about N745 billion. This will increase to more than N1.07 trillion by 2030 and N1.59 trillion by 2045. The average treatment cost for a cancer patient is N30 million.\u201d\n\nNigerians\u2019 angst\n\nDespite the grim figures churned out by ACUF, analysts opine that the issue is more than raising tax to increase revenue.\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a political economist and development researcher, Adefolarin Olamilekan, said the government has to answer the critical question of whether the government\u2019s revenue challenge is a fiscal issue or leakage issue.\n\nOlamilekan said until the government addresses that question, it would continue to further burden businesses and Nigerians with new taxes. \u201cUntil appropriate and concrete answers are provided, the Nigerian state would have no other business than to impose unfriendly taxes on the people and businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the government\u2019s position for the tax on carbonated drinks is justified, the political economist urged fiscal authorities to carefully weigh the impact it would have on the economy before implementation.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the N10-litre tax on carbonated drinks even though it has its justification in terms of curtailing the negative effect of carbonated drinks on the personal health and wellbeing of citizens, the consequence of this type of tax on the economy should be weighed before being implemented.\u201d\n\nThe news of the policy did not go down well with Silas Njoku who manages a provision shop in Jikwoyi in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAccording to him, the news of another tax to the ones he is already paying is not funny at all. He lamented to this reporter that the rise in the prices of goods was already affecting his sales/profit.\n\n\u201cI am yet to find a way of balancing between keeping my customers and selling goods to them at a price that I will be able to make profit and now this new tax on coke and others. How do they want us to survive? Is the government only interested in themselves without thinking of other Nigerians,\u201d he asked this reporter rhetorically.\n\nFor PR expert and lead consultant, Leap Communications, Muyiwa Akintunde, businesses would be forced to absolve the additional costs, but it would ultimately affect their other commitments.\n\nAccording to him, business owners themselves will say that considering all the projects they engage in, in their CSR programs \u2013 they fix roads, construct bore-holes for communities and the like after which they still pay taxes, will this decision not further stretch them?\n\n\u201cFor me, the whole thing is like putting the cart before the horse. Paying taxes is good, however people want to know that their taxes count and that the government is actually using the resources from taxes to their collective advantage and when we have that, it will be easy for people to respond to tax payment without being forced to it.\n\nLabour, others protest\n\nIn a swift reaction, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) rejected the policy, warning that the move could precipitate an industrial crisis in the sector.\n\nAccording to the NLC, Nigeria cannot afford what led to the relocation of two tyre manufacturing firms, Dunlop and Michelin to Ghana following a similar complaint of harsh policy.\n\nA statement by its president, Ayuba Wabba, read in part, \u201cCongress was also alerted by the complaint of manufacturers of soft drinks in Nigeria that the re-introduction of excise duties on their products would lead to very sharp decline in sales, forced reduction in production, and a sure rollback in investments with the certainty of job losses and possibly shutdown of their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also kicked, arguing that the newly-imposed excise duty on carbonated drinks would have a ripple effect on the prices and demand of the commodity, resulting in the loss of jobs due to reduced production activities.\n\nIts director-general, Chinyere Almona, noted that the policy \u201cexposes domestic producers of carbonated drinks to unfair competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal government has announced it will charge an excise levy of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic carbonated sweetened beverages to discourage excessive sugar consumption and boost revenue.\n\n\u201cThe immediate concerns are the likely increase in prices which may lead to a decrease in demand and, consequently, loss of jobs due to a reduction in production activities.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition on imported drinks should be better enforced to protect domestic production from unfair competition in the face of the high cost of production in Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\nMAN\u2019s take\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in its reaction, stressed it would make Nigeria to lose investments to other countries.\n\nMAN\u2019s director-general, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, in a statement said despite the debilitating impact of naira devaluation, inadequacy of forex and the Covid-19 pandemic, the affected sub-sectors contributed significantly to the economy and taxes.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria is the sixth-highest consumer of soft drinks, but per capita consumption is low.\n\n\u201cIt would appear that the goose that lays the golden eggs is being led to perdition. The food and beverage subsector contributed the highest (38 per cent) of the total manufacturing sector to the GDP. It comprises 22.5 per cent of manufacturing jobs and generates more than 1.5 million jobs. So, this levy would certainly cast a sunset to this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, recent studies have shown that introducing excise on non-alcoholic beverages is likely to cause a 0.43 per cent contraction in output and about 40 per cent drop in total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nAjayi-Kadir said the policy would lead to high production costs which would adversely affect production levels and ultimately result in dwindling profits.\n\n\u201cIntroducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\u201d\n\nNLC\u2019s interest\n\nHowever, some Nigerians do not share the NLC sentiment, saying Labour was more about protecting their interest.\n\nFor a Jikwoyi resident who would not want his name in print, everything that the government wants to do is greeted with disapproval.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians and reject. The government cannot raise fuel prices even when babies in gestations can tell prices are going up around the world. The government can\u2019t raise taxes. Nigerians run over bloated civil services yet can\u2019t trim it because of fear of civil unrests, etc. No one wants to make a sacrifice yet you all are expecting the best from your govt. You all want a good life. How in hell is that even gonna happen?\n\nAnother said: \u201cThis NLC is in the dark; when will they learn to pick their fight? Maybe they are defending some companies.\u201d\n\nNo cause for alarm\n\nExperts say there is no cause for alarm, noting that it would not affect the retail price of carbonated drinks as the cost can be easily absolved by the big-time manufacturers.\n\nDavey Ugwuadu, an accountant and tax expert, said the implication of the policy ought to be more on the manufacturers. According to him, the big-time manufacturers should be able to absorb the extra cost without tampering with the retail price of their products because doing that may boomerang.\n\n\u201cNote that the products we are talking about here are highly elastic in demand; it is not something we cannot do without. The manufacturers will look at the middle ground to see what they can do to maintain their sales volume. This is what profit is all about.\n\n\u201cFor me, I expect the big players like Nigerian Bottling Company and 7up Bottling Company to absolve the cost and not bother to tamper with their retail price. We know that the government is looking for money, hence the new excise duty.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the new policy is an additional pain for the manufacturers, the question is what the government will gain from the additional cost, will the consumer gain them, and will the money reflect in governance? Or will the extra revenue go the usual way where money raised from taxes go?\u201d\n\nRe-building trust\n\nFor Olamilekan, the government needs to address the trust deficit that currently exists between it and the citizens. According to the political economist, there is huge gap of mistrust in the country which cuts across the three tiers of the government.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the Nigerian state must communicate effectively with the people on its policy direction. Over the years lack of sound top-bottom communication in indigenous language is the bane of citizens supporting government policy. That is why most government policy is regarded as anti people and pro elite policy.\n\n\u201cThirdly, a reduction from N10 to N3 would be suitable and effective. Lastly, the government and labour must see reasons to dialogue on this especially as the foods and beverages workers may be at lost if business owners tend to act otherwise.\u201d",

          "text": "Rafael Nadal moved one win away from a record 21st Grand Slam men\u2019s title after a dominant start enabled him to beat Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semi-finals.\n\nSeventh seed Berrettini eventually turned the match into a contest, but Nadal completed a 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 win.\n\nThe 35-year-old Spaniard is level on 20 major titles with long-time rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\n\nNadal will face Daniil Medvedev or Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cThe first two sets were some of the best I\u2019ve played for a long time,\u201d said Nadal, who won his only Melbourne title in 2009.\n\n\u201cAgainst a difficult opponent, a great opponent, one of the best of the world, I was able to play I think at a very high level for a long time.\n\n\u201cI had to suffer and I had to fight but it means a lot to be in the final again.\u201d\n\nNadal\u2019s achievement in reaching a 29th Grand Slam final comes only a few months after he thought a foot injury could end his illustrious career.\n\nRussian second seed Medvedev plays Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas later on Friday in the second men\u2019s semi-final at Melbourne Park.\n\nIt is the first time both men\u2019s semi-finals have been played on the same day since 1999, after the decision by tournament organisers to put both women\u2019s semi-finals in the primetime Thursday night session.\n\nUS Open champion Medvedev, 25, was beaten in last year\u2019s final by Djokovic, who did not play this year after being deported from Australia in a visa row related to him being unvaccinated.\n\nTsitsipas, 23, is targeting his maiden Grand Slam title \u2013 after losing to Djokovic in last year\u2019s French Open final \u2013 and his first Melbourne final.\n\nBefore the match there were some lingering doubts about Nadal\u2019s chances, not least because of his injury problems last year.\n\nThese centred around the indoor conditions perhaps favouring the powerful Berrettini \u2013 severe thunderstorms in Melbourne meant the roof was closed throughout \u2013 and how 35-year-old Nadal would have recovered after being \u201cdestroyed physically\u201d from a gruelling five-set quarter-final against Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov.\n\nWith the benefit of two full days without a match since Tuesday\u2019s win, Nadal quickly quashed any uncertainty.\n\nNadal started sharply as he attacked Berrettini\u2019s backhand \u2013 considered the weakest part of the 25-year-old Italian\u2019s game \u2013 from the outset.\n\nA stream of mistakes came from this side as Berrettini fell 3-0 behind and Nadal appropriately sealed the opening set with a serve to the backhand, which the 2021 Wimbledon finalist returned into the net.\n\nThis Berrettini shot continued to break down in the second set, enabling Nadal to take his opening two service games and move into another 3-0 lead.\n\nHead bowed, Berrettini looked unsure how to neutralise Nadal and the other facets of his game were suffering too.\n\nWhen Nadal sealed the second set after one hour and 25 minutes, Berrettini had already hit 24 unforced errors. His inability to test Nadal \u2013 in part because of the Spaniard\u2019s brilliance \u2013 had been costly.\n\nHolding serve at the start of the third set, and putting scoreboard-pressure on Nadal, was imperative for Berrettini.\n\nOnce he achieved that, the Italian\u2019s confidence grew and his fearsome forehand began to trouble Nadal more.\n\nFinally he earned his first break points of the match, taking the second for a 5-3 lead with another forehand winner and serving out to love to ensure at least a fourth set.\n\nBoth men held serve in the opening seven games but Berrettini letting half a chance slip from 3-3 15-30 with two missed forehands proved crucial.\n\nBerrettini had held to love in five successive service games \u2013 but then let Nadal in when it mattered most.\n\nAfter Nadal missed a first break point with a wide forehand to end an intense 23-shot rally, Berrettini hit a forehand into the net for the third time in the game on the second.\n\nServing for the match, Nadal started with a double fault but clinched victory when Berrettini put another backhand into the net.",

          "title": "Russia Says It Won\u2019t Start a War as Ukraine Tensions Mount",
          "text": "Russia\u2019s top diplomat said Friday that Moscow will not start a war but warned that it wouldn\u2019t allow the West to trample on its security interests amid fears it is planning to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, though Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, perhaps offering a path to de-escalation.\n\nTensions have soared in recent weeks, and the United States and its NATO allies worry that the concentration of about 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine heralds Moscow\u2019s intention to attack the ex-Soviet state. Russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans, but has demanded that NATO promise Ukraine will never be allowed to join and that the alliance roll back deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don\u2019t want a war,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a live interview with Russian radio stations. \u201cBut we won\u2019t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned Ukraine\u2019s president a day earlier that there is a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that Russia could take military action against its neighbor in February.\n\nRussia\u2019s official response to those proposals \u2014 and the ultimate decision over whether to invade \u2014 rests with President Vladimir Putin, but the Kremlin has sounded a grim note thus far, saying there is \u201clittle ground for optimism.\u201d\n\nLavrov noted Friday that the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said that Russia proposed discussing those issues years ago \u2014 but Washington and its allies never took them up on it until now.\n\nWhile he described the U.S. offers for dialogue on confidence-building measures as reasonable, he emphasized that Russia\u2019s main concerns are to stop NATO\u2019s expansion and the deployment of the alliance weapons near Russia\u2019s borders. He noted that international agreements say that the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others\u2019 \u2014 and that he would send letters to ask his Western counterparts to address that obligation.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard for them to wiggle out from answering why they aren\u2019t fulfilling the obligations sealed by their leaders not to strengthen their security at the expense of others,\u201d he said.\n\nAs tensions build, Washington warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Several senior U.S. officials also said Thursday that Germany would not allow a newly constructed pipeline \u2014 which is meant to bring gas directly from Russia \u2014 to begin operations if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nAsked about possible sanctions, Lavrov said that Moscow had warned Washington that their introduction would amount to a complete severing of ties.\n\nWhile Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the U.S. ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.\n\nRussia has launched a series of military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. The Russian military also has moved troops to Belarus, which borders Ukraine, for sweeping joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack from the north.\n\nWhile concerns rise about an invasion, Ukraine is already beset by conflict. Following the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled.",

          "text": "Round-the-clock search operations were halted at nightfall, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jose Hernandez said, hours after U.S. authorities reported recovering four more bodies, bringing the tally of confirmed fatalities to five. A lone survivor was rescued on Tuesday morning after a tug boat crew found him clinging to the mostly submerged hull of the overturned boat. He said none of the 40 people aboard had been wearing life jackets. The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday called off a three-day search for 34 people lost at sea off Florida from a boat that capsized while engaged in what officials suspect was an attempt to smuggle migrants into the United States from the Bahamas. Since then, a small armada of Coast Guard and Navy vessels and aircraft have crisscrossed at least 1,500 square miles of open sea off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, an area about the size of Rhode Island.\n\nAsked if the remaining 34 missing migrants should be presumed dead, Burdian said: \u201cIt does mean that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that anyone else has survived.\u201d The survivor told authorities the ill-fated vessel left the Bahamas\u2019 Bimini islands, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami, on Saturday night, and capsized the next morning in rough seas. He was picked up about 45 miles (72 km) east of Fort Pierce Inlet, off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, about midway between Miami and Cape Canaveral. Captain Jo-Ann Burdian, commander of the Coast Guard\u2019s Miami sector, said earlier on Thursday that the quest for more victims would be \u201csuspended\u201d at sunset \u201cif we don\u2019t receive additional specific information to help redirect our search.\u201d The Coast Guard and U.S. Homeland Security Department officials have said the vessel was involved in a human smuggling attempt, but the nationalities of those on board have not been disclosed.\n\nIn a separate incident, the Coast Guard reported intercepting a sailing vessel on Tuesday off another area of the Bahamas overloaded with 191 Haitian migrants believed to be headed for Florida. The Coast Guard said 189 people on that boat were turned over to Haitian authorities on Thursday. A mother and her child were transferred ashore to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, for medical treatment on Tuesday, the day the boat was interdicted, the Coast Guard said. Anthony Salisbury, the agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said it had opened a criminal inquiry seeking to prosecute anyone who organized or profited from the venture. Voyages of vessels carrying Haitian migrants have grown more frequent as the Caribbean island nation faces worsening economic and political crises, as well as gang-related kidnappings.\n\nThe two incidents underscored a surge in migrants seeking passage to Florida in flimsy vessels through the Caribbean by way of the Bahamas, a known hub for seaborne human smuggling.",

I am not seeking to lead a region but the entire country,\u201d Anyim said during an interactive session with multi-media publishers in Abuja.\u201cWhether zoning or no zoning, I will contest. I am contesting because I have something to offer to Nigerians,\u201d said Anyim, who claimed the offices he held in the past had groomed him for the task ahead, adding also that Nigerians would see the difference if he emerged president in 2023.\u201cThe two offices I served in the past are not the same. I\u2019ve headed the parliament, but I have not head the executive. I brought stability to the Senate, I want to bring stability to the country. If you want to see what I did as SGF, you can look at the Godluck Jonathan presidency.\n\n\u201cI have not been president that is why I am vying for the office. I have a good knowledge on how to manage our diversity. I have acquired a lot of experience to run the affairs of the country,\u201d the former Senate President said.\n\nAnyim, who rolled out his plans for the youths, said the world was not waiting for Nigeria and as such, the youths must be groomed on the fourth generation jobs.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhether we like it or not, the fourth generation jobs are here. Most jobs today will be history in the next few years. We are getting to the next quarter of the 21st century and between 2026 and 2050, most of today\u2019s job will be history.\n\n\u201cKnowledge economy will drive the economic direction,\u201d Anyim said of the 21st century industrial revolution the youths should be prepared for.\n\nOn his fight against corruption, Anyim said he would ensure institutions were strengthened.\n\n\u201cThe institution should be allow to do there work. For the institutions, we will put in place messures that will not allow corruption. By the time we deployed technology, where private sector drive every segment of our economic and national life, there is no way people will engage in corruption. People will have no option than to do their work without thinking about corruption.\n\n\u201cI was part of the people that made laws for the establishment of ICPC and EFCC. We will look at them and see how far they have gone. We will use a modern system that won\u2019t allow a window for corruption,\u201d Anyim explained.",
