          "title": "Ohanaeze faults Oluwo on Igbo Presidency",
          "text": "The Igbo apex socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has described as untrue the statement credited to the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, that the Igbo cannot be entrusted with the office of the Nigerian presidency.\n\nOhanaeze noted that Akanbi\u2019s attack on the Igbo was not based on verifiable evidence but rather self-serving.\n\nOba Akanbi had in a statement issued through his Chief Press Secretary, Alli Ibraheem, stated, \u201cNo Nigerian will feel secure in the hands of a leader whose ethnic attachment deprived other Nigerians of their rights.\u201d\n\nHe further accused the Igbo of preventing people from other parts of the country from acquiring property in their domain, adding that the style by the people of the South-East region was barbaric.\n\nBut reacting to the allegations on Tuesday, President-General of Ohanaeze, Prof George Obiozor, described them as untrue and advised Oba Akanbi to \u201cundergo some tutelage under some more experienced cosmopolitan urbane intelligent monarchs,\u201d stating that a well-adjusted traditional ruler is known by being open-minded towards all, especially people of other ethnic groups that may be found in his domain.\n\nObiozor, in a statement issued through the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, stated, \u201cIt is self-evident that Nigeria is a beleaguered country that urgently needs nation building; inflammatory and incendiary remarks from monarchs and the highly placed are antithetical to the peace and unity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Ohanaeze boss, however, explained that one of the reasons the traditional rulers were insulated from partisan politics was to avoid an overdrive or the kind of overzealousness exhibited by Oba Akanbi in an effort to retire a gift from his candidate for the presidency in 2023.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cIn promoting his preferred candidate, he has committed a fallacy of hasty generalisation when he stated that the style by South-Easterners was barbaric; the Igbo couldn\u2019t be trusted with power, among others.\n\n\u201cSurely, such prejudice, innuendo and vitriolic group vilifications against the entire Igbo nation is most unreflective of a royal father whose primary duty is to sow seeds of unity in his kingdom and beyond.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the Igbo are adventurous nation builders; they are found in all parts of Nigeria and beyond.\n\n\u201cThey make friends easily and also feel at home with their children in all parts of the world. Record across the world indicates that the Igbo are branded in Midas touch. They quickly learn the language and culture of the host community, with a view to contribute towards the socio-economic growth of the community. The people of other ethnic groups that had their National Service in Igbo Land can always attest to the friendliness and hospitality of the Igbo people during their service years; some ended up marrying people of the Igbo tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wild claims that the Igbo prevent people from the other parts of the country from acquiring properties in their domain or have an obnoxious policy of depriving other Nigerians of their rights cannot be substantiated. On the other hand, it is inconceivable that a group that builds modern houses in all parts of the country will prevent other ethnics from building in their homestead.\n\n\u201cOne would think that the morbid fabrication of falsehood is a terrible mischief, only for the uninitiated. What else? Oba Akanbi is drawn to his paradox, where he acknowledged the damage done to the Igbo during the Nigerian civil war, and at the same time condemned the agitation by Igbo youth, such as the ESN, for their clamour for inclusiveness based on equity and justice after about 53 years of the Nigerian Civil War.\n\n\u201cThe former President of Nigeria and one of the foremost detribalised Nigerian statesmen, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, has admonished that for peace to reign in Nigeria, the South-East region should be given a sense of belonging by allowing it to produce a President for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe President-General of the Afenifere, an umbrella organisation for the Yoruba ethnic group, has also explained that going by the rotation and zoning principle which has been in practice in the country, it is only fair that the South-East region be given a chance to produce the President. Several other eminent Yoruba icons are also in the advocacy for the presidency to be zoned to the South-East region of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the credentials of the presidential aspirants from the South-East region are not only impressive but very intimidating. These are well-accomplished, brilliant, robust, creative thinkers who have won elections at various levels; some even held offices as ministers and discharged their duties most creditably without blemish.\n\n\u201cIn them is a convergence of both integrity and ingenuity. Furthermore, the very area that Nigerians and indeed the global community can easily come to a consensus is that the Igbo are ingenious, transformative, wealth creators, cosmopolitan, hardworking and tenacious game changers.\n\n\u201cSome of the benefits that Nigeria stands to gain by a Nigerian President of the Igbo extraction are that Nigeria will exit poverty, unemployment, insecurity and calamitous fragile state status. Second, justice will be seen to have been served.\n\n\u201cEmphatically, it is an assertion guided by reason and experience that any country that glamorises injustice can never progress. So, the choices before Nigeria, for our unborn generations, are very clear: either on the path of sustainable national development or on an irretrievable abysmal tailspin.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "SOME Senior Advocates of Nigeria; the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Tuesday, faulted the call by a legal luminary, Chief Afe Babalola (SAN), for the suspension of the 2023 general elections and the installation of an interim government in 2023.\n\nThe legal luminary had, at a press conference on Monday, asked that election be suspended until a new constitution was put in place. He also advocated for an interim government to replace the regime of Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) in 2023.\n\nBut senior lawyers, faulted Babalola.\n\nAlthough the senior lawyers agreed that there was a need for a new constitution, they added that having an interim government in place would not augur well for the country.\n\nTayo Oyetibo said an interim government would destabilise the polity.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI think Nigerians need a stable political environment and an interim government is unstable.\n\n\u201cThe constitution is not the problem of Nigeria; our problem is with the operators of the constitution. Of course, there is a need for adjustment of the constitution. Our problem is never with the constitution. Great Britain has an unwritten constitution, yet the system is being run perfectly.\u201d\n\nAnother lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa(SAN), said the emphasis should be on the restructuring of the country.\n\nAdegboruwa stated, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the revered legal luminary that we should have an interim government, especially consisting of past heads of state. That means the likes of Buhari and Babaginda, among others, will be part of that government and other people who have drawn the nation backward. What is it they have to offer that they didn\u2019t offer while in power?\n\n\u201cRather than recycle those who have run the nation aground, there are younger and talented people who can move this country forward. I think what he was saying indirectly is that there should be restructuring before the election.\u201d\n\nAdegoke Rasheed (SAN), on his part said the call was not feasible.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe constitution has mandated a periodic election and until that provision of the constitution is amended or there is a revolution overthrowing that constitution, it is not possible to have an interim government in place.\n\n\u201cIt is a good idea we must have a new constitution but the call for an interim government is not practicable.\u201d\n\nAlthough Afenifere agreed with Babalola over the bad situation of the country, it nevertheless, said it was not in support of interim government.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, who conveyed the position of the group in a statement on Tuesday, stated that Babalola made the suggestions due to the frustration being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cWhile Afenifere acknowledged the enormity of the problems, we do not support the cancellation or postponement of the scheduled elections.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification whatsoever for this administration to spend one day beyond the stipulated period \u2013 which is May 29, 2023. And the only constitutionally stipulated way of changing government is through the electoral process.\n\n\u201cBeing a law-abiding organisation, Afenifere does not believe in extra judicial means of changing government.\u201d\n\nUzodinma, on his part, said the 1999 Constitution lacked room for an interregnum.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cBy May 29, if there is no elected government, our 1999 Constitution has not provided for an interregnum. There shouldn\u2019t be a gap; otherwise, you are creating room for anarchy.\n\n\u201cWhat will be the process of selecting the interim government because after May 29, the President may not have constitutional powers to function as a President anymore? So, I don\u2019t think we will decide to abandon our Constitution. Our Constitution is like a Bible. For some of us who are Christians, the Bible is the manager of our faith. So, the Constitution should be the instrument guiding our actions as a country.\n\n\u201cIf you think there is an opinion that is worthy of being canvassed which is superior to what is in the 1999 Constitution, such opinion should be taken to the National Assembly and they will, through due process, amend our Constitution to factor in such an opinion.\u201d\n\nReacting to a question about the recent killing of a staff member of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Imo State, Uzodinma explained that INEC was not the initial target.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Fear has gripped residents of the Angwan Bulus community in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State following threats by bandits to kill some residents who were kidnapped recently because of the failure of their relatives to pay the ransom demanded.\n\nThe fear was further heightened as a result of the killing of three out of the 26 kidnapped victims by bandits on Monday night.\n\nThe bandits threatened to kill more of the hostages if the N20m ransom they demanded was not paid.\n\nConfirming this, the Chief of Angwan Bulus community, Gideon Goni, told journalists on Tuesday that the bandits informed the community to go and pick up the corpses of those they killed.\n\nAccording to the monarch, the bandits killed the victims around the Dutse community, along the Kaduna-Abuja expressway.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThey have threatened to kill more, especially women, if their demands are not met. Out of the 26 persons that were abducted, one was released while three had been killed.\n\n\u201cThe one that was released was based on health grounds. He has a liver disease.\u201d\n\nThe monarch recalled that the bandits on March 31, 2022, invaded the community, killed two residents and abducted 26 persons.\n\nGoni stated, \u201cWe came together as a community; raised some amount and they called us and told us to pick some corpses at Dutse.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to them not to kill anyone. We are appealing to the state and Federal Government as well as religious clerics to come to our rescue so that the killings will stop.\u201d\n\nThe state police command\u2019s spokesman, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incident.\n\nJalige said he received a call on the discovery of three corpses at Dutse along the Kaduna-Abuja expressway, adding that the corpses were evacuated by the police.\n\n\u201cThe corpses were evacuated to Saint Gerald Hospital. We are trying to talk to the area commander to ensure the safe return of those who are still in captivity,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

P Fovie and 30 others, urged UPU leadership to with immediate effect withdraw the endorsement, adding that the UPU was usurping the functions of the party in the ongoing electioneering process leading to the primaries.\n\nThe party in the statement said; \u201cIt has come to our notice that the leadership of Urhobo Progress Union, UPU, on Sunday 17th April 2022, via a press statement announced the endorsement of a governorship aspirant under the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, PDP, Olorogun David Edebvie, as the Union\u2019s preferred aspirant and in the same token urged our party delegates to vote en mass for him.\n\n\u201cUPU efforts in the affairs of Urhobo nation of Delta Central Senatorial District will always be appreciated if and only such efforts or interests are not in conflict with the duties and regulations of our party, PDP, and its organs.\n\n\u201cAnd in the instant case, we found out that the purported endorsement of our party member who is a governorship aspirant usurped the functions of our party in the ongoing electioneering process leading to the party primaries.\n\n\u201cThis obvious external interference by UPU and her leadership occasioned by the endorsement of a PDP governorship aspirant in Delta State cannot in any way be encouraged, hence this subtle appeal to the leadership of this great socio-cultural organization to immediately repudiate and/or nullify the endorsement via another press statement, please.\n\n\u201cWe recall that similar endorsement scenario played out in 2014/2015 wherein UPU came in with \u201cUrhobo Governor Agenda\u201d and this singular act not only caused an acute internal crisis in our great party but also created factions in UPU with two President Generals giving orders and counter orders.\n\n\u201cThe grave incursion of UPU in active politics via Urhobo Governor Agenda fractured the sensibility of our amiable governor, Senator Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, who greatly suffered the negative of the Union\u2019s ethnic political activities in 2014/2015.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to overcome the storm within a short period of time in our party but unfortunately, Urhobo Union suffered a great deal which led to a series of legal actions. This kind of unpleasant situation must be avoided, hence it is very necessary for UPU to stay away from the internal affairs of PDP and partisan politics generally\n\nThe party insisted that it would do the Urhobo nation more good than harm if the UPU as a socio-cultural umbrella of Urhobos, strictly adhere to the union\u2019s constitutional provisions and play mere advisory roles for Urhobo political actors and some extent political parties where the need arises.\n\nWhile urging UPU to restrict itself to socio-cultural activities as contained in its constitution and avoid direct involvement in party politics and election matters, PDP in the statement said; \u201cIt is no longer expedient for socio-cultural organizations and town Unions to as a group indulge in political party affairs or endorsements of governorship and other categories of aspirants.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, we strongly appeal to the President General of UPU, Olorogun Moses Taiga and his entire Exco worldwide to kindly withdraw the purported endorsement of Olorogun David Edebvie as the Union\u2019s preferred aspirant in line with the objective of UPU as a registered socio-cultural organization\u201d\n\nThe party told, \u201cUPU and all other ethnic or tribal unions other than political pressure groups and individuals, to completely abstain from endorsing all categories of aspirants in our party, PDP, going forward\u201d.",

No looking back. Good riddance to bad rubbish.\u201d\n\nAdediran, when he was contacted, confirmed the report, saying, \u201cit is true, Ajayi remained expelled from Lagos4Lagos movement.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as of press time, Ajayi could not be reached for comment as his phone rang out several times.",

          "title": "Alleged gang sex: Chrisland denies pregnancy test claim",
          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nThe management of Chrisland Schools, Lagos has refuted allegations that the institution conducted pregnancy tests on one of the students who participated in the World School Games in Dubai, UAE last month.\n\nThe school was reacting to the viral sex video that surfaced on social media and the allegation of rape by mother of one of the students while in Dubai.\n\nRather, the management said it only conducted COVID-19 tests on the students when they returned from the Dubai trip in accordance with laid down protocols on the pandemic.\n\nThe Lagos State government has ordered the indefinite closure of all branches of the school in the State following the distribution of the videos involving the minors.\n\nThe mother of the 10-year-old girl, while alleging that Chrisland School attempted to cover up the gang rape of her daughter, alleged that they also conducted a pregnancy test on her without their consent.\n\nThe school said out of the 77 students in Dubai, only six were involved in the \u201cimmoral act\u201d.\n\nA statement seen by The Nation from the school management, said: \u201cWe have followed up on reports making the rounds on certain developments bordering on the morals and ethics of some of the students under our care, who represented the school at the World School games, Dubai between 8 and 14 of March 2022.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\n\n\u201cHowever, after a comprehensive evaluation of the situation, we cannot help but express how scandalised and distressed we feel as mothers, fathers and instructors with a relationship that holds a direct bearing on the development of those involved.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we took a critical view of the number of students who partook in this recent trip and who did the school proud in our quest to expand the horizons of our students holistically through global exposure, which takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements.\n\n\u201cOf the 76 children who represented Chrisland, 71 ensured an untainted adherence to our standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. Within these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and Boys on the 4th floor to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. This was also to caution our students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform our children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we hasten to affirm that as an institution that is managing children from diverse backgrounds, we cannot lay claim to, or embark on any sense of self-righteousness in our approach, but we learn and evolve within the frames of best practices every single day.\n\n\u201cAs such, as we recognise that there will always be space for improvement, we are therefore irrevocably committed to re-evaluating our processes to reinforce child protection protocols, even as we shall leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the senses of esteem of the children involved are uncompromisingly preserved.\n\n\u201cWe have activated child protection processes and shall be engaging the expertise of child psychologists to ensure we translate this incidence to benefit the children in our care.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore not going to give room to sentiments that adopt less empathy in terms of the effects of the present situation on our children. We implore all of us as stakeholders to work together as build-up partners, rather than pull-down enablers.\n\n\u201cFor every comment we make in this delicate period, we should remember that those involved are children and as such, they deserve our very responsible management of this situation in order not to affect their mental health, as we seek to clear this temporary fog in the path of their growth. This is why irrespective of currently charged emotions, we need to endeavor to keep our heads in focus, while carrying the authorities along in manners that leave nothing hidden, especially as we had nothing to hide.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to reassure our stakeholders that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place on our watch. For emphasis, only a COVID post travel test was conducted on the returning delegation of our students, in compliance with COVID-19 travel protocols, at the Life Centre Medical Services on March 21, 2022 at School Hall, Opebi.\n\n\u201cThis was through the nose swab test as consistent with COVID-19 health protocols. We trust that this can be verified at the source provided. To insinuate that a pregnancy test was carried out on a student, for whatever reason therefore, is a highly unfortunate conjecture.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, our processes would be readily opened up for the scrutiny of regulators and stakeholders at the earliest indication of this, to enable the course of scientific or forensic inspections. We are certain this will lay to rest any shred of doubt or hazy optic that the present flurry of activities might have occasioned.\n\n\u201cFinally, we assure parents and guardians that we take unequivocal cognisance of the duty of care entrusted on us and we would never betray this, as we are more than ever resolved to work harder at keeping and building the trust reposed in us. We refuse to indulge in or give credence to the sentimental contrivances seeking to fuel this crisis the more with various renditions that have taken over the social media space.\n\n\u201cThe only account we are obligated to render is how well the children entrusted in our care have been managed, as we have excelled in doing in this past 45 years of our existence as an educational institution, and to ensure that in this whole development, the only winners here shall be this children.\u201d",

          "title": "National insecurity: Has Kogi found the solution?",
          "text": "Although Kogi State may not be entirely crime-free, it seems to have found a way for its people to cohabit without the terrorism, banditry and ethno-religious violence rocking some parts of the country. This was x-rayed at a seminar for Political and Crime Correspondents. PRECIOUS IGBONWELUNDU and ROBERT EGBE report.\n\nIn Nigeria, geographers often describe Kogi State as \u201cthe South of the North and North of the South.\u201d This historical uniqueness was not lost on Governor Yahaya Bello, who said at the weekend that his state, owing to its location, is perhaps the only state in Nigeria with true Wazobia influences of the 3 major groups (Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo) in the country. He said this during a two-day \u201cSecond Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) Seminar for Political and Crime Correspondents,\u201d with the theme \u201cSetting the Agenda for 2023,\u201d which held in Abuja.\n\nIt is, in many respects, a fitting description for the 31-year-old Northcentral state, which is the only state that shares boundaries with ten states in Nigeria \u2013 Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nasarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, and Niger. It also has several ethnic groups and languages: Igala, Ebira, and Okun (a Yoruba Group) with others such as Bassa Nge of Bassa Local Government Area (LGA), Kupa and Kakanda speakers, who are a people of Nupe extraction under Lokoja L.G.A., Bassa-Komo, which is also of Bassa LGA, Oworo people (a Yoruba Group), Igbo, Ogori Magongo, and Idoma. The state\u2019s geo-location also makes it a major transit route for many southern travellers to Abuja or northern travellers to the Southsouth or Southeast.\n\nKogi\u2019s past security challenges\n\nAt the seminar, speakers and participants highlighted aspects of the state\u2019s security situation before and during Bello\u2019s tenure. For instance, Kogi State Security Adviser, Commander Duro Omodara (rtd) identified the common security challenges in Kogi in 2016 when Bello took office as terrorism, high rates of kidnapping, armed robbery, bank robbery, recurrent Fulani/host community clashes, cultism, labour agitation, political unrest and communal clashes, among others.\n\nOmodara, who delivered a paper entitled, \u201cSucceeding in the fight against insecurity, terrorism: the Kogi example,\u201d traced the problems to several factors. They include the state\u2019s \u201cgeographical location, the general security situation in the country, the established strategy of using the youths as tools for political actualisation (thuggery), unemployment, low-level collaboration and synergy among security agencies, lack of well-structured intelligence gathering, failure to involve the people in intelligence gathering and participation (community policing) and lack of the will-power on the part of those at the helm of affairs.\u201d\n\nOmodara noted that, in the fight against insecurity, no two states are the same in the application of techniques and deployment, especially as more so that \u201cno two states in Nigeria are the same as it relates to people, typography, geographical location, access roads, infrastructures, religion and ethnic diversity.\u201d He further noted several security challenges and incidents in the state, including, \u201cacts of terrorism as a result of activities of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) and some elements of Boko-Haram, the attack on correctional centre on 12 September 2021, bank robbery at Egbe on 21 December 2021, isolated kidnapping cases, Itobe \u2013 Alu, Ofagolo \u2013 Ayingba, Ofu-Dekina LGA, Aduge, Ogale in Ijumu LGA, the influx of bandits from Nasarawa State through Sardauna Village and Fulani/herdsmen and host community clashes.\u201d\n\nSurmounting security challenges\n\nSpeakers at the seminar argued that the security challenges had largely been successfully tackled by the implementation of several policies by the state government. Governor Bello listed some of the measures his administration had put in place to achieve the relative success. \u201cSome of the measures taken by the government to tackle insecurity include clearing of highway bushes, equipping security agencies, engagement of youths in vigilance groups and incorporation of hunters into anti-kidnapping squad.\u201d\n\nHe noted that his administration also involved citizens in the fight against insecurity through the involvement of local government chairmen and traditional rulers in the security arrangement of the state. Governor Bello explained that the kidnapping of his mother provided an opportunity for him to work hard to rid the state of all forms of criminality and make it safe for the citizens.\n\n\u201cUpon my assumption of office as the executive governor of Kogi, I saw it as a divine opportunity among others to rid the state of all crimes and criminality. To achieve this goal, we decided to take simple steps to frontally tackle crime in our society. Some of which is highway vegetation control by clearing six metres on either side of the highway across the state. This simple initiative improved visibility for travellers and eliminated high impulse of kidnappers that usually pound on unsuspecting travellers around blind spots of the highways to execute their nefarious activities.\u201d\n\nBello added that his administration in 2016 procured over 200 patrol vehicles equipped with communication gadgets which were distributed to all security agencies in the state to enable them to embark on daily highways patrol. In addition, he noted that he established the Nigeria Army Forward Operations base at Achoze in Okene LGA, which helped to reduce crime to the barest minimum in the senatorial district which used to be the headquarters of kidnapping and armed robbery.\n\nThe Governor explained that he set up the Kogi State Vigilante Service recruited about 3,500 people, many of whom had retired from various security outfits and were engaged and trained as vigilantes to provide security to lives and property in rural areas. He added that following intelligence that most of the heinous crimes were committed in rural areas, the state government in collaboration with the federal government trained 441 Special Constabulary Police at the Nigerian Police Training College, Ilorin and they have been assisting the conventional police in information gathering and prevention of crime across the 21 local government areas. Since its inauguration last year, criminal activities had reduced drastically in rural areas, he said.\n\nBello emphasised the role of the purchase and deployment of modern technology to fight crime, the purchase and distribution of over 160 vehicles to the security agencies and vigilantes, coordinated clearance operations by security agencies in the state, regular meetings with critical stakeholders: traditional rulers, Aldo, CAN, JNI, LGA chairmen and recognition of hunters to function with vigilantes and in some military operations.\n\nOmodara also elaborated on some of the government\u2019s actions to check crime. He added that data were collated and analysed, \u201ca well-structured intelligence gathering system\u201d was created for the state, critical stakeholders like, traditional rulers, youth leaders, and market women were identified as having roles in providing security. He said the state also identified neighbourhood watch as critical to the provision of security (Know Your Neighbour), it created the needed synergy among the security agencies, the establishment of Operation Total Freedom in September 2016 for effective 24 hours patrols.\n\n\u201cThe strength is now about 545 troops involving the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, Nigeria Police, DSS, NSCDC,\u201d Omodara said. \u201cOur approach to insecurity in the state is very different. First, the people must be carried along in any approach to fighting criminalities; this is much so that criminals live among the people. The body language of a leader must clearly reflect the fighting spirit and the people must be convinced. This is the situation in Kogi with Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cLeadership approach to insecurity is key to finding solutions to insecurity in the Country. Leadership and management skills must drive our performance. In Kogi State, the people understand our approach; we are fighting terrorists and other criminalities by applying our local compact system that is suitable for the state.\n\n\u201cToday Kogi remains foreign investors\u2019 destination. This can be attested to by the records obtained from the Nigeria Immigration Service indicating an increase in the number of expatriates living and working in the State as shown: 2014 \u2013 56; 2015 \u2013 72; 2016 \u2013 (May 73, August 98) \u2013 171; 2017 \u2013 214; 2018 \u2013 246; 2019 \u2013 263; 2020 to date 297. We take issues concerning security seriously including study tours of Military and Security Institutions. Their visits provide us with a lot to share and their reports are taken seriously,\u201d the security expert added.\n\nRecommendation for federal government, other states\n\nThe governor and Omodara recommended several measures the federal government and states can take to achieve the \u2018Kogi success.\u2019 \u201cSecurity is a work in progress; you cannot eliminate criminalities neither can you go to sleep when winning the war. In the fight against insecurity, there are no two states that are the same in the application of techniques and deployment. This is more so that no state in Nigeria is the same as it relates to people, typography, geographical location, access roads, infrastructures, religion and ethnic diversity.\u201d\n\nThey further urged the federal government to recognise the peculiar nature of each state, (typography, landlocked, riverine, nature of crime associated, etc.).\n\nThey noted that a state like Kogi, with over 80 per cent of North/South crossing on a daily basis, needs special attention in the area of deployment and funding, while Niger State, with the largest land expanse, cannot be compared with a smaller land area. Other tips include that neighbouring states must, as a matter of urgency, begin to synergise in intelligence gathering and deployment of technology in fighting crime to curb inter-State crimes. Prosecution of criminals must be revved up and government at all levels should secure ungoverned areas along with the federal government. Opposition in Nigeria must harmonise efforts with the government in the fight against insecurity. Killings and mishaps in the country must not be celebrated as a failure of a government. \u201cOpposition must stand with the government as a result of calamities, rather than turning it to political celebrations.\u201d\n\nAwards for journalists\n\nThe event also featured the award of millions in cash prizes to journalists following an essay competition. The first, second and third prizes of N2million, N1million and N500,000 were won by journalists from Oracle, ThisDay and Punch newspapers. The cash prizes were given to the winners at the event.\n\nGovernor Bello also awarded a scholarship to the family of The Nation\u2019s Crime Correspondent, Precious Igbonwelundu, for the education (up to university level) of her daughter, baby Gila. Dignitaries at the event included Chairman, Senate Committee on Aviation, Smart Adeyemi; National Coordinator of Hope 2023, Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Sen. Jonathan Zwingina; former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode; Commissioner of Information in Kogi State, Kingsley Fanwo; President Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Chief Chris Isiguzo, President Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) Mallam Mustapha Isa, veteran Nollywood actors Prof Sola Fosudo and Keppy Ekpenyong, among others.",

          "title": "Lagos Transportation Policy remains in limbo",
          "text": "After three years, experts are asking, where is the Lagos State Transportation Policy unveiled with fanfare? ADEYINKA ADERIBIGBE writes\n\nExperts agreed that Lagos State couldn\u2019t have been luckier. Successive governments since the take-off of the Fourth Republic have prioritised transportation, with this administration making it the first critical pillar of its six core focus under its THEMES agenda.\n\nThey lauded the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration for its commitment, which has continued to shine brighter with the initiatives aimed at making the sector more responsive to the needs of a growing population, which is projected to hit 40 million by 2042, from its 25 million.\n\nBut that is where it ends. The government had remained less than transparent in its expenditures in the sector. Billions of Naira, would, undoubtedly, have been sunk in the provision of the Blue and the Red Line Lagos Urban Rail Transit system (LURT), the charting of more waterways and introduction of modern ferries, and the initiatives under the Lagos Bus Reforms (LBR), which sought to make public sector transit more attractive, and removing more people from the captives of okada/tricycles, rickety small buses and personal car shuttles.\n\nYet, they wondered what continued to keep the government from releasing the transportation policy midwifed by the past administration and submitted shortly before it wound up in 2019.\n\nAddressing a stakeholders\u2019forum, which held at Alausa, Lagos, Ladi Lawanson, the then Commissioner of Transportation, had said the desire to develop a policy for the sector was to address the challenges plaguing it.\n\nHe said the state is already bearing the weight of its 23 million population with 93 per cent of them being active road users who made an average of 40 million trips daily.\n\nHe said the absence of the policy has been weighing against the development of the sector.\n\nStakeholders are, however, beginning to wonder why a government which seemed determined to improve the lot of the sector had continued to shilly-shally on its implementation.\n\nThe least the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, could offer, recently, was that the government had been reworking the document.\n\nHe said an amendment was necessary before the document was reintroduced into the public.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that we are working on an amendment of the transportation policy and very soon, the governor will unveil it to the public. When it is eventually released, we would have a policy document that would be more robust and would address the gamut of transportation options and alternatives that will optimise transportation and traffic control in a sustainable manner in line with THEMES agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nOladeinde, former director in the Lagos Metropolitan Transportation Authority, LAMATA, was a member of the panel of experts who drafted the policy.\n\nA member of the panel at the weekend wondered why it was taking the government too long to implement.\n\n\u201cI have had cause to ask the commissioner on no less than three occasions why the policy is being delayed and the answer has been the same \u2013 that the government is reviewing it to make it more robust. My question is: \u2018if the main document took us less than six months to put together, why would amendments, which are just meant to make it more robust taking the government almost four years?\u2019\u201d Professor Iyiola Oni of the Directorate of Transportation, University of Lagos, said.\n\nOni, who put together the road component of the policy, said, many of the panel members are seeing the assignment to develop a transportation policy for the state a \u201cmere waste of time\u201d, adding that one of them, Dr Tajudeen Ba\u2019walla, who lived all his life in the service of the sector, died three months ago without seeing the policy implemented.\n\nBa\u2019walla, a Russia-trained railway engineer, was a former Managing Director of the Lagos State Mass Transit Service (LSMTS), and pioneer Dean of the Lagos State University School of Transportation (LASU-SoT).\n\nAnother member of the panel, Prof. Samuel Odewunmi, agreed with Oni, carpeting the government for delaying the implementation of the policy.\n\nOdewunmi, who drew the nexus between transportation and the economy, said Lagos has lost much ground in its failure to implement the policy, adding that such policies could be amended every five years to reflect demand or trend and develop the state\u2019s capacity to address the needs of the population.\n\nOdewunmi,who drew the framework of the policy, added that the state wants to professionalise the Ministry and make it the supervisor over agencies in the sector.\n\nOdewunmi, who wondered how a large state like Lagos, with a population of 23 million, would be operating without a road map. He stated that a weak road map is far better than none, adding that the state would continue to run in cycles where there is no strategic road map.\n\nHe called for the ironing of scope of responsibilities between the Ministry of Transportation and its Works counterpart, adding that while 80 per cent of the scope of work of the latter revolves round road works, it exercises no authority over the regulation of road activities, a development that has continued to generate friction.\n\nOdewunmi, a former dean, LASU-SoT, said: \u201cPolitical wire-pulling might be behind the continued hesitancy of the government to release the all-important element that has the potential to develop the sector. With the way the government is going, I do not see this government releasing the document.\u201d\n\nFor experts, a nexus exists between transportation and the economy. According to them, to move the economy, you need to fix transportation.\n\nThe way to go, they said, is a properly planned public transportation system. \u201cThere is the need to open up the transportation system, expand the infrastructure base and target the masses, who need one form of public transportation or the other to move every day,\u201d Dr. Oladayo Timothy said.\n\nManaging Director, Planet Projects Limited, Mr Biodun Otunola observed that of the 20 million population in the state, nine use public transportation daily.\n\n\u201cIf commuters pay just N100 per trip, about N9 billion exchanges hands daily within the state\u2019s economy.That is about N270 billion monthly.\u201d\n\nThe huge revenue, according to Otunola, goes into private hands, as the sector remains unregulated and grossly underfunded.\n\nDescribing transportation as \u201ca leveller between the rich and the poor,\u201d and an infrastructure that cannot be provided by an individual, Otunola, whose firm is helping Lagos to troubleshoot its transportation and urban renewal challenges, said the answer lies in the government focusing on providing \u201csafe, convenient, comfortable and affordable\u201d mass transportation alternatives.\n\n\u201cThe road is where the rich and the poor meet.

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Abuja\n\nThe High Court lacks the powers to order the deletion of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, the National Assembly has told the Court of Appeal.\n\nIt urged the appellate court to order the retention of the section, adding that Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuahia erred in law when she ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to delete it.\n\nThe section provides that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party\u201d.\n\nIn an appeal against the judge\u2019s verdict, the Federal lawmakers raised five grounds of appeal on why the court should set aside the March 18 judgment.\n\nIt is also asking that the case be heard before the political parties hold their national conventions to select candidates for next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nNot determining the appeal before the deadline for the submission of the list of candidates will defeat the purpose of the law, the National Assembly said.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given the parties June 3 deadline to complete the conventions.\n\nThe lawmakers, through their 18-man legal team, led by Dr. Kayode Ajulo, based their appeal on five grounds, namely:\n\nThe trial judge erred in law and thus acted without jurisdiction by hearing the suit of Chief Nduka Edede without joining the necessary parties.\n\nThe judge erred in law and consequently violated the National Assembly and the Clerk to the National Assembly\u2019s (appellants\u2019) right to a fair hearing when being conscious of the existence of their interest\n\nThe provisions of Section 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(g), and 182(1)(g) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) relied upon by the judge only relate to public servants and does not include political appointees.\n\nThe judge determined the merit of the first respondent\u2019s (Chief Nduka Edede\u2019s) suit without considering his locus standi to institute it.\n\nThe judge erred in law and exceeded her jurisdiction when she ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to delete the provision of Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\n\nThe National Assembly said: \u201cThe record of appeal confirms that the subject matter of the first respondent\u2019s suit before the trial Federal High Court revolves around the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe section regulates the internal democracy of political parties in Nigeria, with particular reference to the conduct of conventions or congress of any political party in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere was sufficient evidence before the lower court that the interest of the National Assembly empowered to make laws for the regulation of internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of the party primaries, party congresses and party convention pursuant to the provision of Section 228 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), would be affected by the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act by the trial Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe principle of law is that where a necessary party is not joined to a suit, the trial court ought to have suo motu directed a joinder of the necessary party for a just determination of the interest of same.\n\n\u201cHaving not joined the appellants herein as defendants at the trial court, the learned trial judge had the prerogative and responsibility to ensure that the proceedings agree with the justice of the case by directing the joinder of the appellants as parties to the suit before determining their interest.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly claimed that its powers were prejudiced by the court when Section 84(12) was declared unconstitutional, null and void without joining the appellants.\n\nThe National Assembly faulted the Federal High Court judge for not giving it a fair hearing by denying it an opportunity to be heard.\n\nIt alleged that the judge allegedly occasioned a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIt said: \u201cFair hearing is a constitutional right that underlines the adjudicatory power of the court to determine any case.\n\n\u201cHad the court afforded the appellants an opportunity to be heard by joining them to the suit, its resolution on the case would have been different.\n\n\u201cThe appellants had no knowledge of the pendency of the suit and the proceedings conducted therein, but there was evidence before the court indicating that their interest as the federal legislative arm of government would be affected.\n\n\u201cThe proceeding conducted and judgment delivered by the court in the absence of the appellants is a nullity.\u201d The National Assembly said it was wrong of the judge to rely on Sections 66(1) (f), 197(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution to nullify Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nIt said the sections only relate to public servants and do not include political appointees.\n\nThe appellant said the trial judge \u201cmisconceived the clear position of the law and gave a perverse judgment\u201d when she held that Section 84(12) is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 66(1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the constitution.\n\nOn the plaintiff\u2019s locus standi, the National Assembly claimed that he did not sufficiently disclose to the lower court how his constitutional rights, as a political appointee/officeholder, had been or were likely to be breached.\n\n\u201cIt is trite law that a person instituting an action before a court of law must have the legal capacity to initiate such suit before the court can invoke its jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe first respondent also failed to show a breach that is higher and above that of the ordinary citizens with respect to the constitutionality or otherwise of the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nThe National Assembly also claimed that the judge exceeded his jurisdiction when he ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation) to delete Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nIt said nowhere in Section 6 of the constitution or elsewhere is the legislative power of the federation vested in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe position of law is clear to the effect that the court neither makes law nor does it possess any power to amend any statute.\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge thereby usurped the legislative powers of the National Assembly by directing the AGF to delete the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThe order of the learned trial judge directing the second respondent to delete the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 is therefore null and void and ultra vires of the jurisdiction of the Court as donated by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended),\u201d it said.\n\nThe National Assembly sought an order to allow the appeal and set aside the judgment delivered by Justice Anyadike.\n\nRequest for urgent hearing\n\nIn an April 12 letter to the Presiding Justice, Owerri Judicial Division, the National Assembly asked the Court of Appeal to hear its case before the national conventions.\n\nThe Assembly demanded an accelerated hearing before the deadline for the submission of the list of candidates for the general election.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by the Assembly\u2019s counsel, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, was exclusively obtained from the court by The Nation.\n\nIt said in part: \u201cWe humbly submit that given the special circumstance and the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit at the lower court and bearing in mind that same borders largely on the conduct of political party congresses and conventions, if the applicants\u2019 motion and appeal are not given expedite and accelerated hearing before the deadline for the submission of list of candidates for general election, the intentions of the National Assembly in making the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 would be defeated.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstance, we, therefore, most humbly apply for expedite and accelerated hearing of both the Motion on Notice for Leave to Appeal as interested parties and the Appeal for the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.We are most grateful.\u201d",

          "text": "By Precious Igbonwelundu, Sampson Unamka, Damola Kola-Dare, Alao Abiodun and Samuel Oamen\n\nLagos shuts Chrisland Schools\n\nSchool denies rape, pregnancy tests\n\nThe Lagos State Police Command said it has commenced investigation into the alleged rape of a 10-year-old pupil of Chrisland Schools.\n\nThe state government also announced the closure of all Chrisland schools in the state pending the outcome of investigations.\n\nA viral video purportedly recorded during a Truth or Dare game by pupils of the school while in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the World School Games, showed the minors engaging in sexual activity.\n\nThe video attracted public outcry after music executive, Ubi Franklin, in a series of tweets, alleged that the girl was raped and her parents kept in the dark by Chrisland Schools.\n\nPolice spokesman Benjamin Hundeyin said the command had commenced investigations.\n\n\u201cThe command is equally taking cognizance of the cybercrime angle to the whole episode and would not hesitate to enlist the support of the Interpol should the need arise.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has assured that due diligence will be observed to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing temporary closure of all Chrisland schools, the government said all allegations were being investigated by relevant MDAs including Ministry of Education, Office of Education Quality Assurance, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Ministry of Justice and the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency.\n\nIt said the criminal allegations have been escalated to the Commissioner of Police.\n\n\u201cWe also use this medium to remind the public that any person, who engages in any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, commits an offence and is liable to custodial sentence of 14 years. This includes \u201cproducing, distributing, receiving or possessing an image of child pornography.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, all Chrisland Schools within Lagos State are hereby closed, pending further investigations.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Franklin shared a video recording of the girl\u2019s mother where she accused the school of conducting three pregnancy tests on her daughter without their consent.\n\nThe woman also claimed that the school kept them in the dark on what truly transpired in Dubai and only told her during a meeting that her daughter and a boy kissed.\n\nThe aggrieved mother, who said the video was only brought to her notice by another parent, said the school suspended her daughter when her family started raising issues, adding that one Mrs. Azike, to whom she handed over her child, also stopped taking her calls when they realised she had known the truth.\n\nThe woman said: \u201cMy child attended Chrisland School, VGC. I am crying out to everyone to help me out. About a month ago, I was on my way out of Lagos when I got a call from Mrs. Azike, the head teacher from Chrisland School.\n\n\u201cShe called me that she needed to see me and I told her I would come when I returned. So, I went there two days after. When I got there, I met two other women in her office; one introduced herself as Mrs. Kemi from Chrisland headquarters and that they just wanted me to know that my daughter, who I left in their care and took to Dubai, had a kiss with a boy.\n\n\u201cThey said they found out that they got the kissing game from Truth and Dare. I said OK, if that\u2019s that, I will take her phone away from her so that she won\u2019t practice it again because that was what they wanted me to do. I asked if there was any other thing. She said no. Even Mrs. Kemi told me that I should not tell my husband, that it is not everything women disclose to their husbands.\n\n\u201cI said okay as long as this is just kissing, I will caution my daughter. I didn\u2019t hear anything from them again. The girl was going to school. I thought everything was fine not until after two or three weeks that we had the conversation, Mrs. Azike now sent me a link that she wanted us to have a zoom meeting by 5pm.\n\n\u201cI said okay. By the time I logged on and didn\u2019t see anybody, I called and she said she will contact the rest. I realised the meeting was with members of the board of directors. I didn\u2019t know the names of participants and I asked that they introduce themselves. One said his name was Mr. Akin and he was the one leading the meeting and was speaking in parables.\n\n\u201cI said if it extends more than this (kiss) my husband will definitely know about it. So we finished the meeting without me getting a clue. The day after, a parent called me that she needed to see me because it was urgent. So, I went to her house and she said there\u2019s a trend in Chrisland that I did not know.\n\n\u201cShe told me to see the video that all the parents were aware. I began to beat my daughter.\n\n\u201cMy daughter then opened up and said Mrs. Azike threatened her not to speak out. She narrated how the school abandoned them in a hotel and how she got into this. They have been sending people to have meetings with my daughter without our consent.\n\n\u201cI am begging Nigerians to help me because they were trying to push us out of the way and my daughter is going insane. Please help me fellow Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOn the part that Chrisland played to cover up this issue, on Mother\u2019s Day, we were all there, not knowing that they had other people that came to interrogate my daughter. After I left, they took my daughter elsewhere. \u201cAgain they had been threatening my daughter that if she spoke, they would kill her, that it is a man\u2019s world. Every day I forced her to go to school she would always feel reluctant. Her class teacher would always call her a useless, stupid girl in front of other children.\n\n\u201cPlease help me. They took her to do pregnancy test without us knowing and lied to us that they were taking her for COVID-19 test. They took her almost three times. After all of that, they sent her a suspension letter.\n\n\u201cAfter I handed her over to you to go to Dubai and we paid a lot for that trip, you got there and left them uncared for. Please, Nigerians help me. When I was asking my daughter for explanation, she said that they went out in the morning for breakfast and one of the boys Kachi begged her to lend him her phone charger and she did.\n\n\u201cLater in the evening after dinner, Kachi called her room to come and get her charger. When she went to the place, one of them opened the door and told her to take her charger from the toilet. It was from there they now hijacked her and told her to take a substance after being under the influence of drugs and after that she didn\u2019t know what she was doing again and she was on the boys then one of them made a video and posted on social media.\u201d\n\nChrisland is not new to sexual controversy. In 2018, a court convicted a 46-year-old teacher of the school, Adegboyega Adenekan, for raping a two-year-old female pupil.\n\nIn a suspension letter signed by the head teacher, G. I. Azike, the school told the parents that their ward was a \u201cmajor and wilful participant\u201d in a Truth or Dare game with other male pupils, and that she \u201cwas involved in improper behaviour during the recently concluded World School Games in Dubai\u201d.\n\nThe school did not state the nature of punishment meted out to the male student involved or the others in the room when the act was done.\n\nThere have been reactions to the viral sex tape of the Chrisland Schools pupils.\n\nOne Dr. Dipo Awojide said \u201cChrisland School has a duty of care for their pupils and students. They failed to enforce this on that Dubai trip. They might get sued by the parents. The state government should ensure schools have policies per duty of care and such policies should be enforced.\u201d\n\nJapheth Omojuwa Omojuwa argued: \u201cThey were in the care of the school when the incident happened. The school should take responsibility for that. In their letter to her parents, they took no responsibility whatsoever. They deserve every smoke they get,\u201d said Omojuwa.\n\nFor @AmaraRadio, the school erred by not inviting and informing the parents about the true incident. She insisted that the incident was not raped but \u201cspoilt children doing what they have done before, but this time, videoing it.\u201d\n\nChibuzo Nwa Emeagwara faulted the parents for failing to bring up their kids responsibly.\n\nDeputy National President, National Parent Teacher Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN), Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo urged parents not to leave their responsibility in the hands of schools or teachers.\n\nThe school issued a statement last night, affirming the priorities they place on their pupils.\n\nChrisland also denied that any pupil of their was raped or had pregnancy test andimistered on her.\n\n\u2018We are proud to reassure our stakeholders that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place on our watch. For emphasis, only a COVID post travel test was conducted on the returning delegation of our students, in compliance with COVID-19 travel protocols, at the Life Centre Medical Services on March 21, 2022 at School Hall, Opebi,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "Amid Worsening Insecurity, Defence Minister Seeks God\u2019s Intervention to Defeat Terrorists",
          "text": "\u2022Military claims massive air strikes, routing insurgents in North-east\n\n\u2022They\u2019re behind banditry in Imo, says Uzodinma\n\n\u2022As Zulum attributes surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP members to divine intervention\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nFrustrated by worsening insecurity, amid wide criticism of government\u2019s inability to protect the citizenry, Minister of Defence, Maj-Gen Bashir Magashi (rtd), yesterday, called for God\u2019s intervention in the fight against insurgents and other criminal elements in the country.\n\nThe resort to divine intervention came on the heels of reported military air strikes in the North-east, which were said to have routed scores of terrorists. The terrorists had, allegedly, fired mortar bombs at civilian targets in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, recently. That was as the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate, with armed extremists striking at will, kidnapping many, and killing scores.\n\nIn Imo State, the governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said persons blaming Buhari for insecurity were the ones behind banditry in his state. Uzodimma spoke on Monday in Owerri at the wedding ceremony of Chinedu, son of business mogul and politician, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, which held at the Cathedral Church of Transfiguration of Our Lord (CATOL).\n\nIn the continuing climate of insecurity, terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), yesterday attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, killing two security personnel.\n\nHowever, breathing a sigh of relief, Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the recent mass surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters and commanders was as a result of divine intervention following prayers from all over the world.\n\nThe air interdiction in the North-east came as Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Farouk Yahaya, charged troops to sustain the tempo of attack on terrorists.\n\nThe Nigerian Army Headquarters also reported the killing of an alleged member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State by military troops.\n\nIn his Easter message, Magashi called for religious harmony in the country, and prayed for God\u2019s intervention to give the armed forces victory in their various campaigns against security threats across the country. He assured Nigerians of the military\u2019s commitment to defending the sovereignty of the country.\n\nMagashi said the Easter prayer should also focus on \u201cremembering members of the armed forces presently engaged in various campaigns, for God to grant them total victory over all threats to national peace.\u201d He prayed that this year\u2019s Easter celebration \u201cwill usher in the desired peace and prosperity as well as a complete turnaround for the Nigerian Armed Forces to clear the doubts of cynics and return sanity to the dark spots in the country.\n\n\u201cThe celebration of Easter, which coincides with fasting in the holy month of Ramadan by Muslims, is not a mere coincide, it underscores the need for religious harmony as well as portends spirituality and specialty of this auspicious times of festivities,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe urged the Islamic and Christian faithful to embrace peaceful coexistence and religious to make Nigeria a better country for all.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force said, after credible intelligence, it launched a devastating attack on Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters on four gun trucks at Kaffa, killing scores of the terrorists and destroying their trucks. This followed Sunday\u2019s midnight attack by insurgents on Goniri in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, where they fired mortar bombs on civilian targets, killing many civilians and injuring others,\n\nA military update said the Nigerian Air Force also scrambled additional Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location and inflict heavy casualties on ISWAP. It said the aircraft was, at the time of filling this report, still patrolling Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to ensure that the city remained safe.\n\nSimilarly, the Chief of Army Staff, who was represented by Maj-Gen GM Mutkut, urged troops to avoid any unprofessional conduct while discharging thier duties. Farouk said the troops should redouble their efforts in order to sustain the current tempo in the fight against the insurgency.\n\nHe spoke at the Headquarters Sector 3 OP Hadin Kai and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Monguno, Borno State, as he joined the Christian faithful and troops of both commands to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Army said troops of 34 Artillery Brigade, Sunday, neutralised a member of IPOB and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN), at Ihioma community, in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nThe army stated, \u201cTroops\u2019 on routine patrol encountered members of the irredentist group, who fired sporadically at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement. In the firefight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray. Troops are combing the general area in a follow up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents.\n\n\u201cHaving suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group has resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety.\u201d\n\nPeople Blaming Buhari Behind Banditry, Says Uzodinma\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, took exception to the assumption that President Muhammadu Buhari should be blamed for the spate of insecurity in the state, saying those, who harbour such thoughts, are the ones behind banditry in the state.\n\nUzodinma stated that members of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state had become targets of attack by politicians and their collaborators, alleging that they are behind the banditry and killings in Imo State.\n\nSpeaking at the wedding ceremony in Owerri, Uzodimma said wicked politicians had decided to hold Imo State captive, killing innocent persons and burning public and private property in the name of politics. He urged the Church and the congregation to pray for such persons to repent.\n\nOn Sunday, while addressing the congregation at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Ozuh Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, on Easter, Uzodimma reiterated that the killings going on in the state were politically contrived. He said it was, therefore, pointless to point fingers at Buhari or the governor, as \u201csome soulless persons\u201d were wont to do.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will touch the hearts of these people, who are sponsoring the killing of innocent ones, burning houses and destroying public property in the name of politics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said it beat his imagination that in the incident, which took place at Ogberuru in Orlu last week, all the victims \u2013 ward chairman, ward secretary and woman leader \u2013 were of the APC.\n\n\u201cI have crosschecked since the inception of this mindless blood letting in Orlu, Orsu and other communities in the zone, not one Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person has died, their houses burnt or attacked. It is clear to me, therefore, that these killings are the handiwork of politicians who are after the APC members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined all men of goodwill to remain fervent in their prayers for God to touch the hearts of both the sponsors of the bandits and their collaborators to come to their senses, particularly, in the light of the occasion of Easter, when Christians remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn Firefight, Terrorists Kill One Soldier, Police Officer in Borno\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP extremists attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, and killed two security personnel.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a large number of suspected Boko Haram elements in many vehicles and motorcycles, armed with sophisticated weapons, invaded the security checkpoints manned by officers of the joint task force, Operation Hadin Kai, comprising military and men of the 30/50 Police Mobile Force (PMF).\n\nMilitary sources said sporadic gunshots rocked the area during the attack, which started about 6pm, forcing many residents of Lawanti Kura, NNPC Depot, and Molai to scamper to safety.\n\n\u201cAfter a fierce battle, one soldier, one Police Sargent, Babangida Yusuf of 50 PMF, were killed in action while one Inspector Chindo Samuel sustained injury.\n\nThe sources stated that one military gun truck and military ambulance were carted away by the terrorists. They were later burnt and abandoned as the insurgents fled on arrival of the military air support.\n\nMolai is situated along Maiduguri-Damboa- Road, which is about 10 kilometres from Maiduguri. The attack came less than 24 hours after the Islamic State spokesman, Abu Umar al-Muhajir, announced on April 17 that it would launch attacks in retaliation for the assassination of its leader.\n\nSurrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP Members is Through Divine Intervention, Says Zulum\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders of Boko Haram and ISWAP was a divine intervention through endless prayers from all over the world.\n\nZulum said this in his Easter message, stressing that the surrender is a miracle towards the healing of Borno State and the North-east.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mass surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders is, certainly, one of Allah\u2019s many miracles towards healing Borno State and rest of the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis mass surrender is the product of the endless prayers citizens across Borno State, the North-east region, rest of Nigeria and, indeed, the world have been offering, seeking God\u2019s intervention to heal Borno State. It is the product of immense sacrifices by the armed forces and volunteers. It is product of repeated calls by political leaders, clergies, elders and traditional rulers, asking insurgents to lay down their arms and embrace peace.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, be optimistic in welcoming the likely benefits of disarming, demobilising, rehabilitating and reintegrating mass-surrendered insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must welcome them without disregarding the risks associated with the programme, hence, the need to sustain stringent security profiling and other Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) procedures that can ensure the overall safety of the programme.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all citizens to fervently pray for the success of our DDR for the mass surrender of those who seek peace, and for the successes of our armed forces and volunteers in frontlines against those who insist on violence.\n\n\u201cMay God grant us enduring peace in Borno State, the North-east and rest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nZulum added, \u201cIn over 12 years of our battles with insurgents (Boko Haram and later ISWAP) Borno State, for the first time, has a golden window that has the potential of ending the insurgency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Discloses Addax had two extensions but failed to pay up\n\n\u2022Oil rises to $113 as Libya outages add to Russia supply fears\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, has said under his leadership, no marginal field operator would be allowed to \u201ctrade\u201d in papers issued by the organisation.\n\nKomolafe, who spoke with the Africa Oil+Gas Report, stated that the rule of law would be strictly followed in the issuance of final licences to the winners, stating that no amount of pressure would make the commission award final documents without due process.\n\nThe NUPRC boss also spoke on the Addax issue. He disclosed that when he assumed office, he reviewed the file and observed that two extensions had been granted for payment, but the company could not come up with the money until the award lapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, oil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nStating that the NUPRC \u201cwon\u2019t be arbitrary\u201d, Komolafe stressed that some of the 119 companies that had fully paid their bonuses were insisting that they could not raise funds without collecting the licences.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn many cases the moment people get a letter of award, they write to say they want to assign. Assign what? There\u2019s a phrase in law, frequently rendered in Latin: \u2018Nemo dat quod non habet\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt means \u2018You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have\u2019. For you to get an award, you have to show the proof that you can pay the signature bonus and you can finance the field development.\n\n\u201cYou get it only because you\u2019ve met the requirements. Your award would have been consummated before you can talk of assignment. We shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people making money by trading papers.\n\n\u201cIt is better you have a regulator that abides by the rule of law than to have a genius as a regulator. If you have a judge in court and he decides to rule on the basis of his ingenuity, then, it becomes a ground for appeal.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf you have such a judge, he is a problem judge; he would be abusing discretion. I am going to ensure that our rules and processes give effect to the law. Awards of acreages will be carried out on the basis of fairness, transparency and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, therefore, insisted that until the process was completed, no licences would be issued, stating all decisions would be taken based on strict adherence to the rules.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnyone whose licence is revoked during my tenure will not have a space to challenge. We will take a decision such that everyone challenging it will be standing on very weak ground.\n\n\u201cNow, some of the 119 companies, who have fully paid their bonuses, have formed the required Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to operate the assets.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for their licences, without which, some say, they are neither able to raise the funds for their work programmes, nor start working relationship discussions with the oil majors, who operate the leases from which the marginal fields were ring fenced.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Addax issue, Komolafe said, \u201cIf you were granted an award, it is guided by the law of contract. If you don\u2019t meet the terms, the award reverts to the original owner. It is now the obligation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to find a viable partner to operate the asset.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that the federal government would pursue vigorously the gas flare commercialisation programme, promising, \u201cI am going to rework, rejig it to finalise the work.\u201d\n\nKomolafe hoped that the process would be wrapped up before the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cIn finalising the round, we will ensure fairness, transparency and competitiveness. We are going to ensure very effective regulation that will give effect to the finest spirit of competition,\u201d he pledged.\n\nReiterating that NUPRC was in the process of developing regulations for the activation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NUPRC helmsman noted that the law must be given effect by regulations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere will be public hearings of the regulator, just as you have public hearings for the law making, you must also have public hearings for the regulations of the law. You must have the stakeholders\u2019 hearings.\u201d\n\nKomolafe explained that the PIA provided robustly for abandonment, host community and award of acreages, but argued that it could not be given effect until the entire process was consummated.\n\nOn how he intended to tackle the challenges, Komolafe said, \u201cI came with a revolutionary mind-set. I am a unique person in the industry, going by my background. I intend to do things differently in terms of adhering to processes.\u201d\n\nOil Rises to $113 as Libya Outages Add to Russia Supply Fears\n\nOil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nAdding to supply pressures from sanctions on Russia, Libya\u2019s National Oil Corp on warned that, \u201ca painful wave of closures\u201d had begun hitting its facilities and declared force majeure at Al-Sharara oilfield and other sites.\n\n\u201cWith global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose $1.37, or 1.2 per cent, to $113.07 at 1332 GMT, not far from the highest since March 30 of $113.80 hit earlier in the session. United States West Texas Intermediate gained $1.48, or 1.4 per cent, to $108.43.\n\nThe Libyan developments offset concern about demand in China, where the economy slowed in March, taking the shine off first-quarter growth numbers and worsening an outlook already weakened by COVID-19 curbs.\n\n\u201cSome Asian investors booked profits as they became worried about slowing demand in China,\u201d said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.\n\nData showed China refined two per cent less oil in March than a year earlier, with throughput falling to the lowest since October as the surge in crude prices squeezed margins and tight lockdowns hurt demand.\n\nIn March, oil surged to the highest since 2008, with Brent briefly topping $134.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that there were concerns of deeper supply losses looming as Russian production declined by 7.5 per cent in the first half of April from March and EU governments said last week the bloc\u2019s executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude.\n\nThose comments came before an escalation in the Ukraine war. Ukrainian authorities said missiles struck Lviv early on Monday and explosions rocked other cities as Russian forces kept up their bombardments after claiming near full control of the port of Mariupol.\n\nAuthorities claimed tribal leaders in southern Libya had shut down the county\u2019s largest oil field \u2014 the latest closure of an oil facility amid a bitter standoff between two rival governments.\n\nOil production at the Sharara field has been stopped and the state-run National Oil Corporation declared force majeure at the field, which produced around 450,000 barrels a day.\n\nForce majeure is a legal manoeuvre that enables a company to get out of its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe corporation called the shutdown of the field an \u201cabsurd move\u201d that mirrored the ongoing standoff in the country. The closure would likely create a fuel crisis in the oil-rich country, as the field was one of the main sources of domestic fuel.\n\nThe corporation did not name those people behind the closure, but its announcement came a few hours after tribal leaders in the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, said they shut down the field in protest against the government of embattled Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.\n\nThey called for Tripoli-based Dbeibah to hand over power to the government of Prime Minister Fathi Bashagha, who was appointed by the parliament in February to lead a transitional administration after Libya failed to hold its first presidential election in December.\n\nLocal media also reported that residents in the south-eastern district of Whahat announced the closure of all oil facilities in their area, also to pressure Dbeibah to step aside.\n\nOver the weekend, tribal leaders and protesters shut down the al-Feel field and the Zueitina terminal on the Gulf of Sirte, forcing the national oil company to declare force majeure at the two facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Funmi Ogundare\n\nThe management of Chrisland schools has explained why it had to suspend some students over a sex tape which went viral on social media.Some students from the private school located in Victoria Garden City, who were in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for the World School Games in March were involved in immoral acts in a trending video on social media.\n\n\n\nThis school\u2019s explanation is coming after the Lagos State government ordered that all branches of the school in the state be shut down.Surprisingly, the school was silent on the action taken against the staff members in whose care the children were at the time of the incident during the trip to Dubai The management had earlier suspended an 11-year-old female pupil said to have been gang raped, claiming that the girl took part in a truth-or-dare game in Dubai where the students represented the school in the World School Games between March 8 and 14, 2022.The school announced the girl\u2019s suspension in a letter to her parent, describing her conduct as improper behaviour.However, the mother of the girl has called on Nigerians to help her seek justice for her daughter, whom she said the school was trying to silence her daughter in order to cover up the immoral incident.\n\n\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY on Monday, a member, Advisory Board of the school, Mr. Akin Fadeyi, said it was scandalised and distressed over the issue, adding that it meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. He added that it was also to caution students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences. According to him, \u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform or children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cThe school, he noted, had taken a critical view of the number of students who participated in this trip to Dubai and who did the school proud in its quest to expand the horizons of its students holistically through global exposure, adding that it takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements. Of the 76 children who represented Chrisland, Fadeyi said 71 ensured an untainted adherence to its standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. \u201cWithin these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and boys on the fourth floor, to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands.\u201dFadeyi reassured that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place under its watch saying, \u201cwhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Urges South-east to focus on \u2018what can\u2019t lie\u2019\n\n*Says tales about marabouts predicting his presidency surprising\n\n*Kukah to Buhari: You have divided Nigerians along ethnic, religion, regional lines\n\n\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nFormer vice president and presidential hopeful in the 2023 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, at the weekend, said what Nigeria needed after seven years of ineptitude of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was a leader who could bring together diversity in unity and encourage the people to respect and accept each other, despite their differences. Atiku said Nigeria needed a \u201cunifier, not a pacifier\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe spoke exclusively to THISDAY in the first of a presidential interview series being conducted by this newspaper.\n\nThis was just as the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, yesterday accused the Buhari\u2019s administration of having, \u201cdivided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe former vice president further reacted to the issue of zoning, saying the South-east should focus on what cannot lie, that is his record, \u201cMy attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\nHe did not miss an opportunity to sell his candidacy and vision, but dismissed tales about marabouts predicting he would be president someday as the reason he had held on to the dream tenaciously. He said the story remained a surprise to him, too.\n\n\n\nSpeaking directly to some of the issues defining the state of the nation on the journey to 2023, Atiku said, \u201cI think after seven years of incompetence, Nigerians just want competence. Where it comes from, they do not mind.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that we face today have so focused us on the need to elect leaders based on their competence, instead of their region or religion. Nigeria needs a unifier, not a pacifier. We will be pacified by unity. We will not be united by pacification.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn insinuations about a groundswell of opinion against his recurrent presidential bids, especially suggestions that the people might be tired of seeing his face on the ballot, Atiku said, \u201cThat is a fallacy. There is no groundswell, to use your word. Yes, there are people who have large megaphones, but they do not constitute a groundswell.\n\n\u201cSome of these people have emotional and historic reasons for making their appeals, and one must be sensitive to them. That is why I have gone round and keep going round this country to consult. I believe in the politics of addition. I am not a subtracting politician.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the mounting sentiments in favour of a Nigerian president of South-east origin in 2023, he stated, \u201cOf course it is in order. Have you forgotten how passionate I have been in advocating for the South-east? Look at my record.\n\n\u201cWhat the South-east has to understand is that people\u2019s records matter more than people\u2019s rhetoric. I ask my beloved people of the South-east to focus on what cannot lie; my record. My attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\n\n\nDismissing speculations that marabouts played a role in his presidential aspiration, Atiku said, \u201cEven me, I am surprised when people bandy about these types of beer parlour myths. I am a devout Muslim. My principles do not allow for anything other than total submission to the will of God.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a myth put together by my political opponents to achieve whatever ends they wanted to achieve. That is just like saying Reagan and Churchill kept trying multiple times because they were powered by soothsayers. It may interest you to know that I became governor after four attempts. Tenacity is a virtue. It is not a vice. It should be celebrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nTalking about moves for consensus approach in selecting the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , Atiku contended, \u201cI just believe that no man should be a judge in his own case. Let\u2019s go down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2010-2011, the North chose to go that route. However, it was not the aspirants who elected on their own to come up with a consensus candidate. It was the region. Specifically, the Northern Political Leaders\u2019 Forum led by the late Malam Adamu Ciroma.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the North as a region wants that option, then, it should be driven by our natural leaders and elders. It should not be promoted by partisans. Once it becomes like that, then, it may become a poisoned chalice.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing the issue if zoning, Atiku said, \u201cI will add this: the Peoples Democratic Party, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning!\u201d\n\n\n\nOn why he still wanted to be president of Nigeria after five \u201cfailed attempts\u201d, he said, \u201cPlease, allow me the liberty of rephrasing your question. I would rather say, after several attempts. They were not failed attempts, as I have already explained above.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the year 2022, Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty, and the third most insecure nation in the world. Our economy is not growing, while our population is expanding.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you now look at my record in government, where under the leadership of President Obasanjo, I was the chairman of the National Council on Privatisation, and a coordinator of our economic management team, you can clearly see my achievements.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose achievements need to be replicated if we are to turn the tide. In fact, it is almost as if providence thrust me out this time to do again what God had enabled me to do before.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe provided jobs. Nigerians are now unemployed in record numbers. We paid off Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt. Nigeria is now more indebted than at any time in our history. Through our policies and inclusiveness, we had relative peace.\n\n\u201cNow, Nigeria is in crisis due to insecurity. It would look to me that my curriculum vitae or my resume appears tailor-made to address the challenges we now face as a nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAtiku spoke on the corruption allegations against him, saying, \u201cThank God you said allegations. Anybody can allege. You know the history of this country and what specifically I went through. All that is now in the past. What I will say, however, is that I am the most investigated politician in Nigeria; yet, nothing has been established against me. I have received a clean bill of health with regard to the allegations raised against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat alone should tell you something. It speaks volumes. In the attempt to stop me, knowing that my plans are sound, my ideology is solid and stable, and my connection to Nigerians is enduring, the only thing that my political opponents could use against me are false allegations. My only answer to that is that I have judicially been exonerated and vindicated of all of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nKukah to Buhari: You Have Divided Nigerians Along Ethnic, Religion, Regional Lines\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kukah, in his Easter Message to the Church and Nigerians, made available to THISDAY, said the problems and challenges currently facing Nigeria were beyond the 2023 elections.\n\nHe lamented that the government had made Nigerians vulnerable and, \u201cignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among the people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping. Notwithstanding these challenges, religious leader must recover to deploy their moral authority and avoid falling victims to the schemes of politicians and their material enticements,\u201d the Catholic Bishop said.\n\n\n\nHe disclosed that the values of interfaith dialogue have come under severe strain and pressure, \u201cwith extremists from both sides of our faiths denigrating the idea of dialogue with their counterparts of other faiths.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnorance and miseducation have combined with prejudice to create the falsehood that somehow, one religion is superior to the others.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith so many ill equipped fraudsters posing as religious leaders, there is an obsession with defaming the others and widening our differences,\u201d Kukah added.\n\n\n\nHe said religious leaders must face the reality, \u201cthat here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam. While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful who are marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the last few years, we have had some good news from outside the shores of Nigeria. The most noteworthy is the initiative undertaken by both Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, Egypt, Shaikh Mohammed Al-Tayeb in 2019, when both of them met and signed the Document on Human Fraternity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPope Francis followed up with the publication of an Encyclical titled, \u2018Fratelli Tutti, We are all Brothers,\u2019 in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe following year, the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly declared February 4, World Day of Fraternity. Both leaders agreed that: \u2018We need to develop the awareness that nowadays, we are either all saved together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence, and suffering in one part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will end up affecting our entire planet.\u201d\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Kukah said, \u201cWe need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that have engulfed our communities and nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name. The way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe maintained that, \u201cin finding our way forward, the President must concede that it is within his powers to decide how we are going to end the war that has engulfed and is tearing down our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems that the federal government has shown far greater commitment to integrating so called repentant terrorists than getting our children back from kidnappers or keeping our universities open. Earlier last month, Operation Safe Corridor announced that it had graduated 599 members of various terrorist groups who have acquired new skills and are now ready to be integrated into society.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total comes to over a thousand now. It is plausible to note that the programme involves pyscho-social support, rehabilitation, vocational training, skill acquisition and start-ups.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite all these, the larger issue is that their various communities have expressed their reluctance to receive their erring sons back. Nigerians have no access to the transcripts of the texts of the confessions of these terrorists not to talk of evidence of their commitment to not sin again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have only the words of the terrorists and the same military that they have been fighting a war with. It speaks volumes when the President and his military hierarchy choose to believe these young men who took up arms and for years waged war against their country, killed, maimed and wasted thousands of lives, destroyed entire communities and now, they are being housed, fed, clothed with public funds,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kukah, \u201call this while their victims have been forced to make the various IDP camps their new homes! Where is the justice for the victims and the rest of the country they have destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe said as a priest, he cannot be against a repentant sinner or criminals changing their ways, noting that, \u201cafter all, the doors of forgiveness must always remain open.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, in this case, Nigerians have very little information as to the entire rehabilitation processes.\n\n\u201cHave these terrorists felt the heat or have they seen the light or, is their repentance a mere strategic and tactical repositioning? So far, we have no evidence that these terrorists have been able to confront their victims not to talk of seeking forgiveness from them. Something is wrong. We see these terrorists adorned in our national colours in their green and white kaftans, trousers, and looking like heroes of the state!\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we to assume that they have become acknowledged models for Nigerian youth? Perhaps the next graduating set might be treated to Presidential handshakes, receptions at the villa with full national colours.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the unfolding event have vindicated his criticism of this government, saying that last week, in solidarity with him, the Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam, JNI, in a statement stated that: \u2018It appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place\u2026.our humanity is being eroded and that erosion is become a new normal.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition, Kukah pointed out that the Northern Elders Forum and the House of Representatives recently called on the president to resign since, in their view it was now clear that he cannot protect his citizens.\n\n\u201cThis has come three years after the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Statement issued on April 26th, 2018 made the same call that was greeted with cynicism,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nThe cleric stated further that the challenge of fixing, \u201cthis broken nation is enormous and, as I have said, requires joint efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy. Our individual hearts are broken; our family dreams are broken; homes are broken; churches, mosques, infrastructure are broken.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur educational system is broken; our children\u2019s lives and future are broken; our politics is broken; our economy is broken; our energy system is broken; our security system is broken; our roads and rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bishop, \u201cas 2023 beckons and the stage is set, the next president of Nigeria must be a man or woman with a heart, a sense of empathy and a soul on fire that can set limits to what human indignities visited on citizens that he or she can tolerate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have no need for any further empty messianic rhetoric laced with deceitful and grandiose religiosity. We need someone who can fix our broken nation, rid our people of the looming dangers of hunger and destitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur presidential aspirants must show evidence from their legacies and antecedents that they know the country well enough and its severe wounds. Whoever wants to govern us must illustrate that he or she understands what is on ground.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe thanked the president for accepting the report of the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy and granting pardon to over 150 Nigerians serving various terms of imprisonment.\n\nHowever, Kukah noted that more serious challenge was to immediately free all innocent Nigerians who are held captive and whose only crime was that they are living in Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Bishop congratulated Christians, saying the Easter celebration brings hope and restoration.\n\nHe further explained that Easter was a fulfilment of what the Jesus Christ had foretold when he said, \u201cunless a grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.\u201d\n\nKukah stressed that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to the Christian faith.\n\n\n\nHe noted that the greatest challenges facing the country was how to begin a processes of reconstructing, \u201cour nation hoping on and to survive the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real challenge before us now is to look beyond politics and face the challenge of forming characters, faith in our country that many have lost confidence in,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "The average cost of making a pot of Jollof rice, a popular Nigerian delicacy for a family of five rose by 7.3 percent to N8,595 in Q1 (Jan-Mar) 2022 from N8,008 in Q3 (Jul-Sep) last year, the latest Jollof Index report released Tuesday shows.\n\nThe Jollof index report published by SBM Intelligence, an Africa focused geopolitical research and strategic communications consulting firm attributed the increase to issues such as high cost of diesel, petrol scarcity and heightened insecurity.\n\n\u201cPetrol prices typically have a knock-on effect on the cost of transportation and food storage, especially for products like turkey given Nigeria\u2019s precarious power situation which forces pretty much every business to run on expensive petrol or diesel generators,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt also added that animal protein sources like turkey and beef accounted for the increase in most of the states in February and March, making it difficult for many families to afford protein in their meals as they are now more concerned about food quantity, than food quality or dietary requirements.\n\nThe SBM Jollof Index is a composite index that tracks how much it costs to make a pot of Jollof rice across 13 markets in nine states in the six geopolitical zones for a family of five or six, the average rural and urban family size in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: Why more than half of Nigerians face food insecurity\n\nThe commodities that make up the index are rice, groundnut oil, chicken or turkey, beef, seasoning, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions. While the index has treaded close to food inflation since collection began in 2016, it has provided a simple way of communicating the realities of inflation to the Nigerian public.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, food inflation (prices) increased to 17.2 percent in March as against 17.1 percent in the previous month. The increase, which is the first rise since December 2021 was a result of the increase in the price of diesel from about N288 per litre in January to over N700 by the end of March, caused by the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nDiesel has a stronghold on Nigeria as it powers a large part of the industrial and commercial activities in the economy, from the trucks used for long-distance haulage of both industrial and finished goods, to small machines used by small-scale enterprises. Cold rooms used to preserve foods and drinks also run on diesel.\n\nImu Ismaila, a petty trader who deals in frozen fish and chicken said she has lost nearly N100, 000 since the power failure that has lasted for several weeks and has refused to improve. In addition to her loss, she said the cost of preserving her goods has increased, due to the high diesel cost forcing her to increase the price of her wares.\n\nA business survey across some markets in Lagos shows that over the past three weeks, the price for a kilo of turkey rose to N3,200 from N2,700, a kilo of chicken increased to N2,000 from N1,500 and a kilo of Titus fish is N2,000 from N1,700.\n\n\u201cBeef, chicken, and fish have become so costly these days. I am not even talking about turkey, I removed that one from my menu a long time ago, and now that everybody wants to add egg, it has gone up too,\u201d One of the respondents interviewed by SBM said.\n\nLikewise, another respondent who is a meat seller described what he has noticed recently that people are abandoning beef for cheaper parts such as intestines, and other innards in a bid to save cost.\n\nThe report also highlighted that across the states surveyed, it cost the most to make a pot of Jollof rice in Wuse II, Abuja at N10,900 while Bayside Mbakpa in Calabar accounts for the lowest cost at N6,840.\n\n\u201cWe can only imagine how many more Nigerians will be faced with a food crisis by the end of the year if there are no actionable steps to tackle the already daunting challenges,\u201d analysts at SBM warned.",

Congratulations Dear Boss!\u201d\n\nBefore the Monday endorsement, the GAC members whose opinions were sought affirmed that Sanwo-Olu deserves a second term.\n\nAnother pointer to the endorsement was the statement made by the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu very recently at a public forum in Lagos, when he described Governor Sanwo-Olu, \u2018\u2019As the most prolific, intelligent , great sound mind and best governor ever produced in Lagos State.\u2019\u2019\n\nA member of GAC had told journalists that, \u201cHe is already getting the endorsement of some divisions in Lagos. Ikorodu people recently endorsed him for a second term, I am aware when he came to commission some projects in the zone. But he needs the support of all the divisions in Lagos and all the GAC members in these zones would have to endorse him. Until then, we just need to be patience,\u201d\n\nIt would also be recalled that the same Governor\u2019s Advisory Council on the 29th September, 2018 endorsed Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu for the party\u2019s governorship ticket in 2019 after a six hours meeting at the Bourdillon, Ikoyi, Lagos, residence of the party\u2019s National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe meeting then was chaired by Tinubu and the meeting was attended then by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, then Majority Leader of the House of Representatives now Speaker of Representatives,Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Mudashiru Obasa, among others.\n\nWith the APC governorship election primaries slated for May 27, the speculation on whether Sanwo-Olu will get a second term has become rife among the residents and political elites in the state, especially members of the APC.\n\nIt was gathered that Governor Sanwo-Olu could not pick his nomination forms for the election because he was waiting for official endorsement of the party chieftains.\n\nGoing down memory lane, his predecessor, Mr. Akinwumi Ambode failed to secure a second term in office because he fell out of favour with the party structure and GAC members.",

          "title": "2023: Ngige Formally Declares Interest In Presidential Race",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige Tuesday formally declared his intention to contest for the position of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHe said he has a burning desire to see a prosperous, united and equitable Nigeria, according to a statement from his media office.\n\nNgige unveiled his presidential ambition before a crowd at St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church Alor, Idemili South local government area of Anambra State.\n\nAddressing the crowd, comprising APC faithful and other supporters, the former Anambra State Governor said having served 40 years in the public service, he was fully equipped as an administrator, with huge wealth of experience, capacity and energy as well as large heart to accommodate the differences among Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO: Politicians Sponsoring Thuggery Pose Threat To Nigeria\u2019s Democracy \u2013 INEC REC\n\nNgige who recounted his numerous achievements as a former governor, ex- Senator and two-time minister, described himself as the \u201cJack of all trade and master of all\u201d that Nigeria needs now.\n\nHe thanked the President for the opportunity offered him to serve as a minister, which broadened his knowledge of the various ministries, departments and agencies, being a member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and the conciliator of disputes between employers and employees in the various arms of government and the private sector.\n\nHe said his stewardship in the difficult and complex Ministry of Labour as the chief conciliator, enriched his knowledge of the problems of workers, the difficulty the industrialists and entrepreneurs face, why industries close down, and why some run far below their installed capacity and in turn employ less hands .\n\nNgige said, \u201cI also know the unproductive areas and the areas of waste in the public service. I see the energy in labour which has not been properly harnessed. I have seen the low hanging fruits in agriculture , the handicaps, the factors that militate against job creation, which is one of the mandates of my ministry, especially the inter-ministerial and inter agencies cooperation that is missing. I have seen our burgeoning population without a corresponding advantage in terms of improvement in GDP.\u201d\n\nLabour experience\n\nHe said under his watch, the Labour Ministry has conciliated 1,683 industrial disputes in the last seven years, 95 percent done successfully in the ministry and its agency, the Industrial Arbitration Panel (IAP), while only about three percent of the disputes went up to the National Industrial Court of Nigeria(NICN).\n\nThe minister said they took labour administration to a higher level in the international arena , where their labour diplomacy brought Nigeria back to the Governing Board (GB) of the International Labour Organisation(ILO) after ten years in absence .\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria came in first as deputy (titular) 2017, and now full regular member of the GB , having also been elected as the Chairperson of the Government Group , where he presided over the affairs of 187 countries of the ILO between 2019 to 2020.\n\n\u201cMy dear friends , colleagues and comrades, many would wonder that after serving seven years as Minister in one of the most difficult ministries of government , in a polity riddled with rising unemployment, bickering and economic disputes between workers and employers, in a famished economy, Dr. Chris Nwabueze Ngige would have asked for a deserved rest. Yes, a deserved rest would have been okay for me as a person but the zeal, the burning desire in me to see a prosperous, united and equitable Nigeria, where no man is oppressed , where there is no chasm between the haves and have not, would not allow me to go home and rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, as I sit back to ruminate on the state of our country, I find a country led by a patriot, good hearted leader, Muhammadu Buhari, though greatly misunderstood especially in the South Eastern part of Nigeria . Permit me to say that I want to get the nomination of our party and to stand on its manifesto to actualize and execute the programmes of the APC.\n\n\u201cShall we say the APC as party and as a government has failed? The answer is a big No. The three cardinal issues upon which Nigeria gave us a mandate in 2015 are infrastructure/economic development, security and anti-corruption. In properly assessing this government and our programmes, it is important we start from where we met Nigeria in 2015. I don\u2019t want to be one of those in the class of wailers, wallowing in self-pity. No! I want to be your ambassador so I can go and grow prosperity, grow the resources that are needed for a big country like Nigeria. Truth be told, Nigeria has been in the years of the locust, starting from the 80s, 90s, the long period of military rule to 2015. Luckily, the leaves were all eaten away but the tree and the branches still stand. Yes I\u2019m part of this administration, so I should know what the resources look like and I know what the challenges are. This is because I\u2019m in the room and I\u2019m privy to decisions taken. In scoring the administration, one can give us a pass, credit or distinction in infrastructure depending on the assessor . But let me ask. Can you score a government that has invested massively in infrastructural development, built roads and bridges like Lagos -Ibadan-Ilorin Rd, 2nd Niger Bridge almost completed, and the reactivation of the rail system anything but distinction?\n\n\u201cYou can also score us in security, again depending on the baseline \u2013 even though we know that the security deterioration is also linked to the economic situation of the country, which has stifled jobs while population gallops by the day.\u201d\n\nPolice reform\n\nNgige said if he becomes President, the Nigerian Police , as the agency in charge of homeland security would be equipped with men and material to function optimally, lamenting that attempts by the current administration to increased their men by 10,000 every year in the last five years was stifled by unnecessary bureaucracy .\n\nAccording to him, the decentralization of the Nigerian police is the way to go, so that governors of states can be chief security officers in name and in reality.\n\nHe added that the structure of the Nigerian police needs to change and mimic that of the judiciary which has worked well with the State judiciary and the federal arm in a handshake.\n\nHe said as a former governor and Chief security officer of a state, he knows what to do and how to do it.\n\nNgige recalled that as Governor of Anambra State, he met N42b debt, schools closed for one year with teachers and civil servants owed for almost a year, doctors and health professionals on strike for eight months and pensioners treated as \u201cdead woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met dilapidated infrastructure, with hopelessness and despair written on the faces of the people of Anambra State. The judiciary was also neither equipped nor energized to do its work. Importantly, I turned all these into history as I cleared the arrears of salaries, pensions, as well as paid off genuine creditors. I and my team rejuvenated the civil service . We further introduced knowledge based promotion through examination. Under our administration, 500km of roads across all senatorial zones were built in 30 months, unprecedented in the history of the State . Handled by the best contractors, these roads still stand like the Rock the of Gibraltar, 16 years after. Anambra then became a metaphor for solid roads under the slogan of Anambra People\u2019s Money at work!\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful assured that if elected President, he would deploy the resources belonging to Nigerians to the expansion of the infrastructure efforts of the current administration in roads, rail, air and even inland water ways.\n\nASUU Strike\n\nNgige also spoke on his role in the incessant strikes of academics in public universities.\n\n\u201cSome persons have been feeding the public with wrong information that my office is to blame for the incessant strikes by labour unions,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is an opportunity to explain my role as a conciliator. There is a misconception that the conciliator is also the man who will actualize and implement whatever is reached in an agreement. This is wrong . A conciliator is like an arbitrator and not the person who implements the agreement so reached . At most , he can do a facilitation by persuasion for the parties to implement the agreement and that\u2019s where the role stops .\n\n\u201cIn the case of the university unions, it is important to make it clear that the Federal Government is not owing them salaries and wages rather, what is being owed is a carry-over of allowances (Earned Academic Allowances/Earned Allowances) from the past administration and that the carry-over is being paid in installment, under a negotiated agreement . In one or two occasions that government defaulted for lack of revenue to pay, it was properly rescheduled.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, detractors have told unions that Ngige is their problem. How can the Minister of Labour be their problem when he is not their employer ? The Minister of Labour is neither a member of the Governing Council of universities nor the Minister of Education or Finance. The same goes for health workers and doctors. The government side and the fixers of salaries and wages met with them and told them what they are able to pay, which is an ILO principle of Negotiation \u2013 Capacity and ability to pay . Instead of following up with negotiations, they would turn around to blame the Minister.\n\n\u201cFor example ASUU invented a payment platform, called UTAS . UTAS has been subjected to necessary tests by National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) which said it cannot recommend the system for use, having passed User Acceptability test, but failed Integrity and Credibility test. ASUU said Ngige can do the magic, to force NITDA to clear UTAS and also force the Ministry of Finance to deploy it. This magic is beyond me. They ascribed the powers I don\u2019t have to my office.\n\n\u201cHowever, conciliation and arbitration is within the ambit of my Ministry and we are doing whatever we can , including persuasion, and subtly moving into other ministries, to try to pressure them, in order to resolve some of the issues. I\u2019m a concerned parent whose children are also in the public universities in Nigeria . In the Seventh Senate , I championed the cause of labour. How then can I turn around to stop the progress of these institutions?
