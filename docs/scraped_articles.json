          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nWomen who smoke while pregnant are at risk of giving birth to babies with cleft lip and palate, a mental health expert, Dr. Sunday Amosu has warned.\n\nDr. Amosu who is a Consultant Psychiatrist, Drug Abuse Unit, Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State, said smoking during pregnancy could also lead to sudden respiratory distress and death of infants.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, pregnant women need to be careful because even those who are passive smokers are also prone to these problems.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview, Dr. Amosu stressed that women who smoke are particularly at risk of giving birth to babies with defects.\n\nHe stated that available statistics show that about one out of every 10 Nigerians currently smoke cigarettes.\n\nHe advised pregnant women to stay away from tobacco use, warning that babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are also prone to suffering from repeated pneumonia within one year of their birth.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with an orofacial cleft than women who do not smoke.\n\nAgain, the CDC said women with diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy equally have an increased risk of having a child with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate, compared to women who did not have diabetes.\n\nThe psychiatrist said, \u201cThere are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and 80 per cent of them are in the low and middle-income countries including Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWomen who smoke are particularly at risk. We can look at the risk of tobacco smoking in pregnancy in terms of the risk to the baby and the risk to the mother.\n\n\u201cThe mother faces the risk that anybody that smokes whether male or female faces like lung cancer, chronic pulmonary diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke. There is a great risk for the baby when it comes to tobacco in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that there is an increased incidence of cleft mouth and cleft lips among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Also, pregnant women who smoke may have a miscarriage and lose the pregnancy.\u201d\n\nDr. Amosu further said smoking during pregnancy could also cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n\n\u201cThe baby will just develop acute respiratory syndrome while in the cot begin to breathe excessively and suddenly the baby will die.\n\n\u201cWe have also discovered that within the first year, the baby is prone to having repeated pneumonia which is the infection of the lung.\n\n\u201cWe also need to be careful because even those who are passive smokers are also prone to these problems,\u201d he said.\n\nThe psychiatrist called for concerted efforts to tackle the menace of smoking in Nigeria.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says no fewer than 1.2 million people die annually due to exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nWHO says tobacco kills half of its users and also harms nearly every organ in the human body.\n\nThe global health body cautioned that even smoking one cigarette a day could seriously harm a person\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cTobacco use can lead to lung, mouth, throat, oesophagus, stomach, bowel and other cancers.\n\n\u201cIt increases the risk of chest and lung infections, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and other conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is no safe form of tobacco,\u201d WHO said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Femi Falana\n\nLAGOS\u2014HUMAN rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, Wednesday, declared that former President Goodluck Jonathan cannot contest the 2023 presidential election by 137 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\n\n\n\nThere have been speculations that the former President may defect from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nJonathan was elected President of Nigeria in the 2011 election but lost to Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.\n\nFalana, in a statement, said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that former President Goodluck Jonathan has decided to join the All Progressives Congress, APC, to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHowever, the former President is disqualified from contesting the said election by section 137 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended which provides as follows:\n\n\u201c\u2018A person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as President shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\u2019\n\nRetroactive\u2026\n\nSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr. Jonathan.\n\n\u201cAssuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of four years and if a second term, another period of four years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Gov. Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a Governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umoru Yar\u2019adua.\n\n\u201cHe later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that if he wins the election he will spend an additional term of 4 years.\n\n\u201cIt means that he would spend a cumulative period of nine years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution, which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Consequently, CAN Kaduna State frowns at the way these families have been left on their own, especially the lack of adequate and encouraging proof from the government and the agency responsible for rail transportation to douse their fears\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs part of utter disregard, not the managing Director of NRC nor the Hon Minister of Transport, who should have resigned and tendered a public apology by now for his or their failure, has acknowledged their oversight in averting the incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, while innocent citizens are held captive for no offence, and at great risk for their safety, some individuals in charge of the transport industry, throwing decency to the wind, are mounting podiums, declaring to vie to be Nigeria\u2019s next President. For the records, the concerned individuals involved must be reminded that Nigerians are not insane to reward failure with the presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cCAN, thus, on the 30th day of painful remembrance of the train attack and aggressive kidnap of lawful travellers who boarded the train call on all Christians in Kaduna State and beyond, with people of goodwill, to intensify prayers for the victims and their families and to continue to speak out till everyone is safely released and back home to their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cCAN is aware that insecurity has worsened the pain that Nigerians go through reaching a peak where people are so miserable beyond what words can convey. Currently, many households are starving, as many are without jobs, food, and health care, whereas university students are at home because of the ASSU strike. Moreover, citizens cannot move freely to seek means to bring succour to their children, wives and aged parents due to fear of bandits and terrorists\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, CAN is calling on the federal government to give definite marching orders to the security agencies to go out there and rescue the 17 women, 4 children, and 41 males, held hostage, whose photos the terrorists have disrespectfully sent out to the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also wish the terrorists to realize that Nigerians want all the 62 people in captivity back home safely to their families, not their pictures. The terrorists should present any grievances they have directly to the government and stop inflicting pain on innocent Nigerians who are out seeking daily bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo those, the terrorists and bandits are holding hostage, we love you and will not cease to pray and play our role till you all come back safely while we hope that our country is liberated from all forms of criminality.

          "text": "The embattled Chairman of Langtang North Local Government Area of Plateau State, Hon. Joshua Laven has blamed Governor Simon Lalong over the recent killings in Kanam LGA of the State.\n\nHe said if the State government had responded swiftly to intelligence reports, the carnage that took place in the a\n\nCouncil would have been averted.\n\nHe also alleged that the Governor failed to make judicious use of local intelligence reports at his disposal.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that a few weeks ago, over 100 people were killed and thousands displaced by bandits when they invaded 8 communities and unleashed mayhem in the Council.\n\nLaven disclosed this in an interview with journalists on his arrival from Abuja at the Yakubu Gowon Airport Heipang, Barkin Ladi LGA of the State.\n\nHe added that there are always local intelligence reports from the security agencies, vigilante groups, members of community policing and the community leaders prior to most of the deadly attacks that claimed innocent lives in the State.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe responsibility of every government is to protect lives and properties.\n\n\u201cIn August last year, I raised alarm over terrorists camping somewhere in Wase LGA, which is a neighbour to Langtang North LGA; four months later, the Emir of Wase His Royal Highness Muhammad Haruna later confirmed that 50 percent of Wase LGA has been taken over by terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the State government was not proactive in handling security issues, adding that instead of calling him to ask where he got the information, they debunked his claims.\n\n\u201cThe State government cares only when it has happened, the government is supposed to be proactive to prevent attacks on innocent people.\n\n\u201cIn my own case, when I discovered that the terrorists have invaded our land, I worked in collaboration with the local security and they confirmed it.\n\n\u201cThere are always security reports about the activities of terrorists in the State. For Yelwa Zangam where 29 persons were killed, there was security intelligence reports for more than three days, but no action was taken to avert the looming danger.\n\n\u201cThere was also intelligence reports about the attack in Mangu and the next is Langtang North.\n\n\u201cSo, I called all the traditional rulers, security heads in Langtang North and the local hunters to a security meeting where we mapped out strategies and alerted our people and that was what prevented what would have been a bloodbath in Taroh land in August, 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that, \u201cfour months after Wase was hit, it is now the turn of Kanam LGA where over 100 people were killed. This is because we don\u2019t take local intelligence reports serious, we need to rise and protect our people.\u201d\n\nLaven also said by law he remained the authentic Chairman of Langtang North LGC, who was duly elected by the people as confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nResponding to a video in circulation in which he was accused of inciting a particular ethnic group against another, Laven said it was because of his love for peace that he recovered over 1000 firearms in Langtang North LGA and handed them over to Governor Lalong.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf I can recover over 1000 weapons and the Governor and the military came here and received them, it shows my love for peace.\n\n\u201cNow, they are heightening tension in my community because that video was translated by mischief-makers\u201d, he stressed.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe NWC of the party recently released new guidelines mandating all political appointees who aspire to participate in its primaries at all levels to resign at least 30 days before the conduct of the primaries.\n\nIt was learnt that the new guidelines may have scuttled the ambitions of aspirants for different elective positions who did not resign from their appointments as of Tuesday, April 25.\n\nGovernorship, Senate, Federal and State Assembly primary elections to select APC candidates for the general elections, according to the party\u2019s timetable, would hold between May 18 and 23.\n\nExpectedly, appointees for such positions who did not resign would have lost whatever was left of their chances to contest in the primaries.\n\nBased on the guidelines, key appointees of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s, namely, Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi and his labour and education counterparts, Chris Ngige and Nwajuiba, who are gunning for the 2023 presidency have barely 24 hours to resign or forget their ambitions.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe APC primary for presidency, according to the ruling party\u2019s timetable, has been scheduled to hold between May 30 and June 1.\n\nSection 3(i) of the APC\u2019s final guidelines for the conduct of primaries, as of Tuesday states that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates. Any political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\nA credible source and member of the NWC told Daily Sun that recalcitrant aspirants who have refused to resign will be disqualified by the screening committee. The source said the NWC had waited, but without success, on President Buhari, to issue a directive that all his appointees contesting for various positions should resign in line with the provisions of the new Electoral Act.\n\nHe said their disqualification may pave an easy way for the leadership of the party and other critical stakeholders to settle for a consensus candidate that will square up with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nA Federal High Court in Umuahia had nullified Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, recently passed the National Assembly. But an appeal filed by the National Assembly, the Court of Appeal directed all parties involved to maintain status quo, until a judgment was given. Despite the directive by the Appeal Court, Buhari\u2019s appointees, led by the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, are unwilling to resign.\n\nNgige, while daring the NWC of APC, said his decision was in line with the 1999 constitution.\n\nHe said the March 18 judgment of the Federal High Court in Umuahia struck out section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, hence he was under no compulsion to resign his appointment.\n\nBut Nwajiuba, said yesterday, that he would not resign his position to contest 2023 presidential elections until 30 days to the election. He stated this in Abuja at an event to present to him the nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC for the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nHe stated that the Section 82 of the Electoral Act is not binding on him, rather he is following the guidelines as stipulated by the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nNwajiuba made reference to Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, who, he said, resigned his position as minister of solid minerals four years ago after he had won the ticket of APC at the primary elections before he informed the president and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) that he was leaving for Ekiti State.\n\nBut Asked when he will resign in line with his party directives, Ngige said: \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know about that I\u2019m hearing for the first time from you. But like I always say, I\u2019ll be guided by the letters and spirit of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou are pushing me into something that is not necessary to discuss, because that aspect of the law enacted by the National Assembly, via the Electoral Act, that section 84(12) has been struck down by a court of law and the cases are on appeal. And for now, no matter how bad the judgement is, that\u2019s the maximum jurisprudence, no matter how bad the law is, it is a judgement of court, it should be obeyed, until upturned or stayed.\n\n\u201cBut there is no stay, there\u2019s no atonement of that particular pronouncement, and the party is on appeal. So the judgement is still subsisting, that aspect of the law was injurious to some persons and should not have been there.\n\n\u201cI also know that the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria in certain sections, section 107, 137 and 88, prescribes disqualification clauses for people who are going for election and that prescription is supreme, because it\u2019s in the constitution and the constitution is grand-norm of all laws.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the same party is aware that the judgment of the court has not been vacated, and is also asking members aspiring for office to quit office, Ngige said: \u201cI have not seen that pronouncement from the party. I have not seen any release from the party. It has not been conveyed to me or to anybody. I\u2019m an aspirant, I\u2019m a presidential aspirant. So I\u2019ll find out and if it is true, I would then know what to do.\u201d",

I usually get my accolades and my joy from seeing the laughter and smiles of pleasure on the faces of my beneficiaries, I am glad for this honour,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Abia First Lady said she was happy about the award not only because it was coming from an independent group that has assessed her work, but also a reputable organisation like The Sun.

I know I have done a lot in the area of women empowerment, but deliberately most of them are not publicised. However, it seems the eagle eyes of The Sun Newspaper have spotted me.\n\n\u201cI thank the Managing Director and his team.

Now, I can\u2019t stop even if I want to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled and honoured to be nominated for this award and I\u2019m even grateful to be able to accept this award. I dedicate it to the Nigerian women who are actually delivering the future generations for this nation.\u201d\n\nRevealing how she started out rendering humanitarian services, she said: \u201cIt was when I became a first lady that I realised what I went through (during childbirth) was a bad situation because of the infrastructure in the country.

          "text": "\u2022Says publishing governor\u2019s character flaws in public interest\n\nBlessing Ibunge\n\n\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the suit by Governor Nyesom Wike against THISDAY newspaper and others on alleged libel yesterday, the defense witness, Mr. Jude Igbanoi, presented more video evidences to show the unreliability of the state governor.\n\nThe video further showed that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was not libelous. Igbanoi also rejected the assertion by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the publication was reckless, insisting that the publication was fair comment on a matter of public interest.\n\nThe court watched video of Wike as the Director General of Godwin Obaseki Campaign Organisation campaigning for Obaseki\u2019s re-election and saying good things about Obaseki only to turn round a few years later to be attacking his character. The court also watched video clips of Wike as the Director General of Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s campaign organisation, where he was praising the former governor of Rivers State to high heaven only for him to change and started attacking him which THISDAY argued buttresses his (Wike\u2019s) unreliability.\n\nDuring the cross examination, the witness, Igbanoi, argued that the publication by THISDAY did not make Wike\u2019s political associates and friends to shun or abandon him. The publication did affect his relationships and did not make him lose any privilege or opportunities that would have come his way. He was appointed Director General of Obaseki Campaign Organisation despite the publication an indication that the publication clearly did not injure his public perception.\n\nThe court at the end of the cross examination of the first witness for the defendant adjourned till May 20, to begin cross examination of the second witness.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY outside the courtroom, the defense counsel, Tuduru Edeh, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, explained that: \u201cThe sitting yesterday concentrated on playing exhibit F and L, which were videos namely where Wike was campaigning for Amaechi as his campaign director for his governorship election and he praised Amaechi to high heavens.\n\n\u201cIt was played to demonstrate that, that was the position he had, but it is a different story today having fallen out with Amaechi.\n\n\u201cThe first video was to show that even though the man claimed libels but going through the videos you see a man who was made Director General of Obaseki\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nEdeh added that: \u201cThe witness emphasised that he (Wike) was not shunned, political associates did not abandon him as a result of the publication he is complaining about.\n\n\u201cThe matter was adjourned till May 20 for continuation of hearing, for us to bring our second witness.\u201d\n\nJustice Adolphus Enebeli of the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, adjourned till May 20, 2022 to continue hearing on the suit.\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the matter, the lead counsel to Wike, Emmanuel Ukala, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, put to the witness for the defendant that the publication made by THISDAY was reckless and could negatively affect the image of the claimant.\n\nLast month, the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had also watched video clips tendered by THISDAY. Then, in the video clips presented by Igbanoi and played in the courtroom, he had in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements opened his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments. He had argued that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion suit against THISDAY and three of its staff, claiming that the newspaper publication of June 23, 2020, with caption:\u201dWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\nThe governor had claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\nWike had also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Prohibits payment of ransom to kidnappers\n\n\u2022Amendment aims to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks\n\n\u2022To align with the required standard as obtainable in other jurisdictions\n\n\u2022NDLEA wants political parties to include drug test in screening process for aspirants\n\n\u2022Umar urges FG to ensure immediate release of kidnapped victims of Kaduna-bound train attack\n\nMichael Olugbode, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\n\n\nAs part of efforts to avert the imminent placement of Nigeria in the International Cooperation and Review Group Process of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its looming sanctions on the economy, the Senate yesterday passed a bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, as well as prohibit payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nThat was as former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of passengers abducted by terrorists during the Kaduna train attack. Umar made the appeal in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nThe passage of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nChairman of the committee, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central), explained, \u201cThe need to comprehensively review the Terrorism Prevention Act arose from the unfavourable ratings of FATF recommendations of Nigeria\u2019s Mutual Evaluation Report and consequent placement of Nigeria in FATF\u2019s International Cooperation and Review Group Process with its impending sanctions on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the National Task Force on improving Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in Nigeria had proposed improvement on the Act in order to address the deficiencies noted in its provisions and align it with the required standard obtainable in other jurisdictions.\n\nTwo months ago, the federal government disclosed that it had uncovered 123 companies and 96 other entities linked to terrorism financing. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the companies included 33 Bureaux De Change (BDC). Mohammed also stated that the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit uncovered the suspected companies and individuals.\n\nThe companies, which were alleged to be conduit for movement of money by terrorists, are yet to be tried by the federal government.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been increasing attacks by different terrorist groups across the country, with several lives lost, scores injured, and many kidnapped or missing and unaccounted for.\n\nCurbing terrorism financing has remained a hard nut to crack for the Nigerian government either due to lack of political will or gaps in legislation. This has exacerbated insecurity and fear, what with the attempted attack on the Kaduna airport, attack on a Kaduna-bound train, and attack on security personnel and formations, all recently, as well as other nefarious activities by terrorist groups.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Derivatives Company Limited revealed that in the past decade, an estimated 87,903 persons had died through assaults by Boko Haram, sectarian actors, and other armed bandits in the country, with a lot of Nigerians now living in fear.\n\nBamidele, in his presentation, said the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, sought to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers, and terrorists for release of any person who had been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cThe overall import of this bill is to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom in Nigeria, which is fast spreading across the country.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the memoranda presented to the committee, a plethora of issues relating to terrorism and terrorism financing, in line with global best practices, were raised. He assured that the amendment to the terrorism law would set standards and the regulatory system intended to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks.\n\nBamidele added, \u201cHaving policies in place to combat financing of terrorism will surely reduce or eliminate privacy and anonymity in financial and other sundry transactions as it relates to the subject in our society.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the proposed repeal and enactment bill was geared towards improving the effectiveness of countermeasures against terrorism, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.\n\nThe senator noted that the repeal was aimed at providing adequate framework for improved international collaboration, inter-agency cooperation, and freezing of terrorist funds/assets.\n\nBamidele stated, \u201cThe passage of this bill will save Nigeria from being included among countries in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List with its attendant negative consequences, which might ultimately result to international sanctions that would affect the image of the country in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said it would complement the federal government\u2019s efforts in the fight against insecurity, when signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLawan said, \u201cIt is our belief here in the Senate that this bill, by the time signed into an Act by Mr. President, will enhance the efforts of this government in the fight against terrorism, kidnapping, and other associated and related vices.\n\n\u201cThis is one piece of legislation that can turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have done so much as a government, in terms of infrastructural development across all parts of this country, but because the security situation is not the kind of situation that we all want, this tends to overshadow all the tremendous and massive developments in our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the executive will waste no time in signing this bill into law, and it is our hope that this additional piece of legislation will achieve the purpose for which it has been worked upon by the Senate, and, indeed, the National Assembly, and for which it would also be signed by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear here, that the fight against insecurity, whether it is kidnapping, terrorism or whatsoever, is not the sole role of a government.\n\n\u201cThe contribution and support by citizens is essential, because our security agencies need vital and critical information against terrorism and other things that make life difficult for us.\u201d\n\nThe upper chamber passed the bill after it scaled Third Reading on the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate, thereafter, adjourned plenary till May 10, for the Sallah break.\n\nNDLEA Wants Political Parties to Include Drug Test in Screening Process for Aspirants\n\nAlso, the Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd.), yesterday urged political parties to make drug integrity test part of the screening requirements for aspirants seeking to contest political offices on their platforms in the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement quoted Marwa to have said this during the 2022 First Quarter Best Performing Commands Awards ceremony, held at the agency\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Marwa, \u201cFor politicians, we have long advocated and I take the opportunity again to repeat the advocacy that when they run for public office it demands a lot of responsibility from the person and we need to be certain if he\u2019s a person that is already a drug addict/user who will spend all the money he\u2019s given for public service to consume cocaine and his head will not be in a stable condition to handle the affairs he has been entrusted with.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we have advocated and will continue to advocate that drug test be conducted for politicians; some state governments, like Kano State, is already doing this.\n\n\u201cNot just politicians, but government appointees, and I\u2019ve just sent a letter this morning to the National Chairman of APC, who will be the first of the National Working Committee (members) I wish to pay an advocacy visit on this issue.\n\n\u201cI recommended that drug tests be incorporated in the screening process for all those interested in running for public office; we will do the same to the PDP and other important parties.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing officers and men of the agency present at the event, Marwa said the ceremony \u201chas become part and parcel of our corporate culture. Recognising and rewarding hard work and excellence has always been a pragmatic way of stimulating productivity and enhancing the attainment of organisational goals; making it a tradition for the agency is our way of enshrining meritocracy in the system.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that statistics from the first quarter (Q1) report indicated, \u201cour performance level has not dropped off.\u201d\n\nMarwa said, \u201cIndeed, achieving 3, 539 arrests, 677 convictions, and seizures of 65, 916 kilogrammes of drugs in three months is no mean feat. Little wonder our performance continually earns the agency deserved accolades from the right quarters within the country as well as from abroad, especially from international partners and peers. While we have not yet achieved the utopia of a drug-free society, the results showed that we are getting it right.\u201d\n\nHe told the officers that the awards and commendations were expected to spur them to surpass their current feats at the next ceremony.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe ceremony should be a poignant reminder for us not to forget where we are coming from. And there is no better way to say it other than for us to be mindful of the saying that success has a hundred fathers, but failure is always an orphan. No organisation would understand this adage better than NDLEA in the light of our past rock bottom experience.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we should all be mindful that we hold the fate of NDLEA in our hands, and that fate will be determined by our patriotism and dedication to duty, as well as our collective resolve to work towards the attainment of the agency\u2019s mandate.\u201d\n\nMarwa told the officers and men to continue to propagate the agency\u2019s War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) programme in their various commands.\n\n\u201cThere is much we can achieve when our communities are working hand-in-hand with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHighlighting the strong emphasis on collaboration with all stakeholders, in the agency\u2019s roadmap, the NDCMP 2021-2025, the NDLEA chief executve stated, \u201cWe have to woo members of society to work with us on this very important assignment. Therefore, I charge you to ensure that WADA is correctly and deeply entrenched in the spheres of operation of your respective commands.\u201d\n\nUmar Urges FG to Ensure Immediate Release of Kidnapped Victims of Kaduna Train Attack\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, yesterday, Umar said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, remained disturbing.\n\nUmar also appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.\u201d\n\nOn March 28, terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train and killed eight people, while several others were injured. Many people were abducted and are being held in captivity by the terrorists.\n\nOne of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack on the Kaduna bound train had been delivered of her baby, THISDAY reported yesterday.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62.\n\nThe gunmen had ambushed the train heading for Kaduna from the nation\u2019s capital after bombing its rail track.\n\nARISE Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, had quoted the terrorists as insisting that they were not after a ransom, but exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were allegedly in government custody.\n\nThe TV station further quoted a family source as confirming that one of the two pregnant women among the kidnapped victims had given birth in the terrorists\u2019 den with the help of doctors invited by the gang.\n\nSources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development that is still shocking to both the government and security operatives.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

What NALDA is doing at this time is to encourage farmers and individuals to aggressively go into farming in order to achieve food security considering the situation the world would be going into as a result of the Russia/Ukraine war\u201d.Ikonne, further disclosed that there are plans for NALDA to cultivate wheat in the state after the wet season harvest.He assured the farmers of continuous support all through the farming process through extension services to ensure maximum yields -as well as market availability as NALDA would off-take yields from the harvest.The traditional ruler of the communities, Kanankur Sule Longvel while receiving the inputs on behalf of the communities, commended the authority for being the first to bring such an intervention to them.He assured that the inputs would be fully utilised, and further appealed for the construction of access roads to the farms and tractors to be made available to enable them engage in mechanised agriculture.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Fixing political leadership challenge panacea for rescuing Nigeria, Says Anyim\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nAhead of the May 28 and 29 presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) and as presidential aspirants of the party intensify their consultations with statutory delegates, former ministers of the party said that age and integrity must play crucial role in determining the presidential candidate of the party\n\nThis is even as the forum identified faulty political recruitment process as the bane of development in the country over the years.\n\nThe former ministers from 1999 to 2015 spoke yesterday when the former Secretary of the government of the federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim officially notified them of his presidential aspiration.\n\nAlso, Anyim tasked the former ministers to ensure that the party adopts a proper political leadership solution for the purposes of exiting Nigeria out of it\u2019s political crisis.\n\nThe former senate president said that fixing political leadership is panacea to rescuing Nigeria from the present political crisis.\n\nThe former ministers who spoke through their leader and Dean of former ministers, Tanimu Turaki (SAN), who was a Minister of Special Duties and Inter Governmental Affairs insisted that the party must ensure that age and ability becomes the determinant factors in choosing the presidential flag bearer of the PDP in the coming national convention of the party.\n\nHe said as a result of leadership failure, Nigeria has not been able to take her rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nNigeria, he said, needs a man with the energy and capacity to tackle the developmental needs of the people in 2023, stressing that the ex-Ministers, given their knowledge in the inner workings of government, would play a pivotal role on who becomes Nigeria\u2019s next President.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need a person that is not very old. He (Anyim) has acquired sufficient experience and maturity and he is not also very young. So, he can relate with some of us that are young.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that has the courage to take decisive decisions because Nigerian needs a very strong and powerful president. We need a man of integrity, a person that will listen, a person that will be compassionate, a person that will show sympathy and empathy to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe greatest problem we have had in this country is leadership failure because leadership has failed in this country and because the head of the fish is rotten; ultimately and quite invariably, the body of the fish will also be rotten.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that we must take special interest in what happens to our party in the build up to this election. We will play a very active role, we will liaise with the leadership of the party in selecting a credible candidate that will win election for us and win election for Nigeria and in the process, salvage Nigerians from the twin evils of hunger and poverty.\u201d\n\nTuraki lauded Anyim\u2019s experience across the three arms of government, likening same to exactly what Nigeria needs to awake the giant in her.\n\n\u201cBetween the experience you have gathered both from the legislative and executive arms of government and of course while you have never had the opportunity of heading or playing a pivotal role in the judiciary; your qualification as a senior lawyer now fills that gap and makes you one person that has the opportunity of gravitating and serving from both arms of government in this country,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the ex-Ministers, time has indeed come for Nigerians to settle for a leader who has what it takes to make the country works, because, \u201cnever in our political history have we been so divided among different unimaginable lines. It is important that we go for a person that can build very strong bridges of friendship among the various divides.\u201d\n\nAddressing the former Ministers, Anyim who was also a Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said his knowledge of public service places him at a vantage position to make Nigeria work for all.\n\nAccording to Anyone. \u201cWhen I worked as a civil servant, it was in two parastatals in the Presidency. I worked as President of the Senate, working along with the President to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cI worked as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the engine room of the Presidency. My experiences are cognate. I am not going to learn on the job; I am going to continue from where we stopped.\n\nHe pointed out that if Nigerians elect the wrong leader, the country will sink more deeper than she is today.\n\n\u201cLet me also say that today in Nigeria, we are concerned about things that are not going well. There is insecurity, there is economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe first commitment I want to offer Nigerians is to stand on the framework of consensus and reunite Nigerians and reduce mutual suspicion,\u201d he pledged, adding that \u201cwhen we are able to redirect the nation on the path of unity and eliminate mutual suspicion, all of us will come together, pick the right hands based on competence and capacity and work together to refocus the economy, rescue the country and rebuild our society.\u201d\n\nPresent at the meeting were Elder Godsday Orubebe, Labaran Maku, Solomon Ewuga, Sanusi Dagash and Josephine Anenih.\n\nOthers include Ina Ciroma, Mukhtar Shehu Shagari, Osita Chidoka, Solomon Ewuga, Sola Akamode among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Techstars, one of the most influential accelerators in Africa, announced on Tuesday the ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator for early-stage fintech and proptech startups across the continent.\n\nThe programme came about through a partnership between Techstars and ARM Labs, the innovation hub of ARM, an asset management group in Nigeria.\n\nWhile the accelerator will be open to startups across the continent, the opportunity highlights the continued focus on Lagos as Africa\u2019s fast-growing tech hub. Known as the commercial and cultural capital of Nigeria, Lagos surpassed Nairobi to become the top African city on StartupBlink\u2019s 2021 Global Startup Ecosystem Index. The ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator will be the second Techstars-hosted programme on the continent; the first was in South Africa.\n\n\u201cLagos has built a successful startup ecosystem that merits more global exposure, investments and resources, and we see extraordinary potential in the market,\u201d Techstars general manager Nancy Wolff said in a press release sent to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTechstars has been investing in Nigerian and African startups for years, and through our partnership with ARM Labs we look forward to bringing the value and reach of the Techstars\u2019 global network to the increasingly prominent Nigerian startup ecosystem,\u201d Wolff added.\n\nTechstars\u2019 work in Africa is more than a decade old, with its investments and mentorship programs dating back to 2011. Since then, the accelerator programme has hosted more than 400 Techstars Startup Weekend events across 40 African countries. In 2016, the company launched its first Africa-based accelerator, Techstars Cape Town; that was the same year it operated the Barclays Accelerator Programme, which supported fintech innovators in South Africa.\n\nAfricans in the diaspora have participated in and benefited from Techstars\u2019 accelerators, too. Through about two dozen accelerators, including Techstars Toronto, Techstars New York City, and Techstars Atlanta, Techstars have invested in over 50 startups across Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has invested in 14 Nigeria-based startups collectively, including Healthtracka, FarmCrowdy, OurPass and Rent Small Small. Some of the startups it invested in outside Nigeria include Rwanda\u2019s PayDay, South Africa\u2019s WizzPass, Ghana\u2019s BenBen and Kenya\u2019s Duhqa.\n\nThe ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator Programme will also allow the partnering companies to tap into Africa\u2019s ever-lucrative fintech sector. Investment tracking platform Partech reported that 63% (or $3 billion) of Africa\u2019s total VC funding went to fintech companies in 2021.\n\n\u201cOver the years, ARM has been on a mission to support African fintech startups that are solving key problems in innovative ways,\u201d said Jumoke Ogundare, CEO of ARM. \u201cOur partnership with Techstars is the logical next step in propelling the African continent to become the future global capital of fintech and transform how Africans access financial services.\u201d The application window for the ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator Programme opens May 8. A selection committee will award 12 startups $120,000 in funding, as well as curated startup programming and mentorship. The inaugural class will have its Demo Day in February 2023.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

While the sale has not been finalised, some changes in the European Union could affect its business.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we discussed possible changes following the Digital Services Act, NFT scams, and African agritech inventions.\n\nBeginning with news of the passage into law of the Digital Services Act, we discussed the implications of stricter controls on tech companies. I argued that while the restrictions on targeted advertising would impact advertising revenue for these companies, it is too early to tell how much of an impact it would be.\n\nWith the law not immediately coming into force, it would be interesting to see how tech companies adapt to these changes.\n\nWe moved on to the $2 million NFT scam on the Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s Instagram account.

However, not seeing upward trends in the crypto market might make you concerned about the future of your investments. But isn\u2019t it the best time to buy while prices are low? If you are not overly excited about investing in popular cryptos, then take advantage of Logarithmic Finance (LOG) presale pricing!\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG)\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG), a next-generation Layer-3 swapping protocol, promises to make it easier for innovators and investors to collaborate. Logarithmic Finance aims to provide all users with a secure and non-custodial DeFi (Decentralised Finance) platform.\n\nInnovators in the LOG community will be capable of raising funding from any blockchain network of their choosing, including Ethereum (ETH), Tezos (XTZ), Solana (SOL), Binance Smart Chain (BNB), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC).\n\nThe Logarithmic Finance roadmap emphasises the benefits that platform users will receive from participating in the platform\u2019s ecosystem. The cryptocurrency will provide stacking incentives and Exclusive Pools Access.\n\nMembers of the LOG community will have exclusive access to NFT auctions where they may trade their NFTs for cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. These transactions will have their gas fees cut by 80%.\n\nLogarithmic Finance\u2019s presale is showing a promising growth of over 106%. This has attracted lots of attention in the crypto scene. Some investors are anticipating a 5000% LOG price increase ahead of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother impressive token currently offered in presale is Aquasis Protocol (AQS). In the DeFi ecosystem, Aquasis Protocol will provide a solution for quick and low-cost transactions. By depositing their USDC tokens, users will be able to automatically pay membership fees and generate interest on their savings.\n\nBoth token launches are facilitated by BoostX, a premium multi-chain launchpad. This advanced technology enables crypto investors to participate in exciting exclusive presale events.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR)\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a decentralised platform that focuses on accessibility and secure scalable technology development. NEAR Protocol, a Layer-1 blockchain, was developed to be a community-run cloud computing solution. It aims to provide an effective platform for the creation of decentralised apps (dApps) as well as a user-friendly environment for developers.\n\nNEAR is centred around the implementation of NightShade technology, a sharding architecture that enables rapid transaction throughput while simultaneously boosting the capacity of the blockchain.\n\nThe cryptocurrency aspires to even further decentralise the NEAR environment by allowing network validators to get more involved in sponsoring new and expanding projects.\n\nTo participate in securing NEAR, validators must stake NEAR tokens as collateral. This system modification will also ensure that unique and original projects may partake in network security, as well as that innovators get greater visibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedera (HBAR)\n\nHedera (HBAR) is a long-lasting, enterprise-grade public crypto that allows anybody to build powerful decentralised apps (dApps). Hedera is not based on a traditional blockchain, but rather on Hashgraph, a novel ledger system that improves performance, cost, and scalability.\n\nWithin the ecosystem, the native token HBAR fulfils two functions. HBAR supports Hedera services like smart contracts, file storage, and regular transactions while also safeguarding the system and ensuring the platform\u2019s integrity.\n\nHedera is gaining popularity and adoption in the cryptocurrency industry. The platform guarantees 10,000 transactions per second throughput.\n\nFor more information:\n\nLogarithmic Finance\n\nhttps://presale.logarithmic.finance/register\n\nhttps://logarithmic.finance/\n\nAquasis Protocol (AQS)\n\nhttps://presale.aquasis.io/\n\nhttps://aquasis.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "title": "Nigerians\u2019 woes worsen on oil sector mismanagement",
          "text": "The Nigerian government\u2019s take from every $100 revenue earned by it and its joint venture (JV) partners is about $77, confidential data seen by BusinessDay show, but mismanagement of the vital oil sector has worsened the economic woes facing Nigerians.\n\nA profitability analysis of the joint venture economics shared with BusinessDay shows that at $100 per barrel, an average of $20 will be eaten up by production cost, $51 will go to the government as petroleum profit tax and $19 is paid to the government as royalties.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company gets $5 as its own profit, while $2 will go to the government as Niger Delta Development Commission levy. This leaves the JV partners \u2013 private oil firms \u2013 with only $3 per barrel sold at $100.\n\nThe analysis also showed that by way of returns on investment, the Nigerian government stood to make $6 from every dollar it invests in the joint ventures.\n\nThis means that the government gets a 640 percent return on its spending, leaving many wondering why the government is not spending more, so it can make even more.\n\n\u201cMany of these joint venture fields are reaching their production limits and rampant crude oil theft is making it hard for local investors that have taken over the fields from developing them further,\u201d said Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm.\n\nAbove-the-ground issues have deterred both local and foreign investors from injecting capital in Nigeria\u2019s troubled oil sector, once touted as the goose that lays the golden egg.\n\nIn chronicling the many painful evidence of the mismanagement of Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, BusinessDay spoke to retired and serving Nigerian oil chiefs, international oil companies (IOCs) and local operators who said the clearest proof of the government\u2019s failings is in its inability to meet OPEC quota, put an end to rampant crude theft and attract new investments.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Tellimer, in the first quarter of 2022, on average, Nigeria under-produced by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) versus the quota, which translates to $1.8bn in total lost oil revenues (based on a $97/barrel oil price) over the three months.\n\nThe value of crude oil stolen in the same three months calculated at the same global crude oil price at around 250,000bpd is another $2.25bn, making a total of more than $4bn for the first quarter of this year alone and which would have made a huge difference in terms of government revenues and the country\u2019s foreign exchange crisis.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari who appointed himself petroleum minister, assisted by Timipre Silva as minister of state, is superintending over a sector where investors are ignoring and presents the best case study for state incapacity.\n\n\u201cIt is bad that this theft goes on but what we have found worrying is the seeming failure of our colleagues in government to be stirred into taking the required action. Each time we go to Abuja for a meeting with them, the government people just sit there looking at us and you are left wondering if they understand or if they see it as a priority,\u201d a CEO of an international oil firm told BusinessDay on condition of anonymity.\n\nIOCs, which once made Nigeria\u2019s joint venture scheme the envy of many countries, are fleeing the country. The result is the massive degradation of Nigeria\u2019s oil infrastructure, rising cost of production, the fall in Nigeria\u2019s capacity to produce oil and rising crude shut-ins.\n\nFor instance, the global leader in gas, British Petroleum (BP), came to Nigeria more than 10 years ago and was forced to pack up its bag and leave after waiting for years for the Nigerian government to come to the party.\n\n\u201cNigerian government officials fumbled for years; they could not see the big picture but most tellingly, they failed to see into tomorrow. In the end, BP counted its losses which amounted to more than $100m and chose to leave the country,\u201d said one senior oil sector official closely associated with BP travails.\n\nThe official said if BP had gone ahead with the aborted multibillion-dollar investment, Nigeria would not be struggling today to supply gas to Europe, which is facing reprisals from Russia.\n\nGas prices in Europe rose 20 percent Wednesday after Russia halted gas supplies to Poland. For weeks, European embassies in Nigeria have been making desperate calls to chiefs at Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG), asking how the company can help meet the growing gap in European gas supplies following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRead also: Expert advocates boost in oil production ahead 2060 zero emission target\n\nBusinessDay gathers that the NLNG is facing its worst gas shortage in 22 years as oil production shut-ins compound the difficulties of the oil firms that supply it gas.\n\nMost of the gas produced in Nigeria comes along with crude oil, and that is why the gas is called associated gas. So, when oil production is stopped because of crude theft or pipeline vandalism, gas production also stops.\n\nAiteo, an indigenous operator that secured seller financing years ago to acquire the Nembe Creek Trunk line, has abandoned the vital asset and does not even use it to carry its own crude oil because of oil theft and frequent attacks on the pipeline by organised crude oil thieves.\n\nSome oil sector officials say that while the contempt for JV partners rose to a peak during the days of former oil minister Diezani Alison Madueke, the situation has yet to improve.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that at one meeting with leaders of the legislature a year ago, a leader of that branch of government wondered why oil companies were still operating in Nigeria if things were as bad as they claimed. However, unknown to the senior legislator, the oil firms began leaving Nigeria quietly almost a decade ago and the pace of their exit has only become visible.\n\nThe oil sector has an outsize influence on Nigeria\u2019s economy despite representing a relatively small proportion of the gross domestic product: about 9 percent. But, crude oil sales make up one-third of the government\u2019s revenue and about 90 percent of the West African nation\u2019s export earnings. Before the discovery of oil in 1950, agriculture was the backbone of the continent\u2019s largest economy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s dependence on oil has been very disruptive as evidenced in 2020 when it was hit by a massive shock at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, as oil revenues collapsed by around 65 percent. But while revenues inched up slightly, the severe foreign exchange crisis in the country of 200 people has not abated.",

          "text": "An oil price of $100 per barrel is wonderful news for any oil-producing country, but Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest top producer, is not making the most of the rally.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s biggest investment and energy intelligence firms have turned more bullish on oil in the medium to long term as analysts bet crude supplies would not keep pace with the fast-rising global demand.\n\nThe price of Brent, the benchmark for Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, has stood at $100 in the past few weeks amid supply concerns triggered by a tighter supply outlook after sanctions against Russia \u2013 the world\u2019s second-largest oil exporter and a key European supplier \u2013 over its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \u201cspecial operation\u201d.\n\nWhile a $100 oil price means a boom for oil-dependent countries like Saudi Arabia, for the first time in Nigeria\u2019s history, it means little or nothing owing to an opaque subsidy scheme and the failure to produce more oil to take advantage of soaring crude prices.\n\nBased on data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 (OPEC), the other years in history when average crude oil price reached $100 were 2011 ($107), 2012 ($109.45) and 2013 ($105.87).\n\nThe oil rally in those years translated to improved economic activities as Nigeria recorded an average oil production of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011; 1.9 million bpd in 2012 and 2.2 million bpd in 2013.\n\n\u201cWith the current system in place, Nigeria needs more than a miracle to have an oil boom at N150,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, a former chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, said.\n\nOPEC data also show the highest price ever paid for crude oil was between June and July 2008, when a barrel of crude oil was sold for around $130 to $147, although the average crude oil price in 2008 ended up being $94.45 per barrel.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil assets are facing rising existential risks, which are compounded by wasteful expenditure,\u201d Nwakwue says.\n\n\u201cDespite rising oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s oil production is currently struggling at levels never seen before, but the regulators are ignoring the problem and disguising under OPEC\u2019s quota,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, said.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s oil output fell by 15% to 1.24million bpd in March \u2013 OPEC\n\nBusinessDay analysis shows an oil price increase from $14 per barrel in 1979 to $35 per barrel in 1981 was an oil boom for Nigeria\u2019s 1981 population of 75.4 million people, because an oil export revenue of $24.9 billion led to an oil revenue per capita of $330. However, $35 means little or nothing for Nigeria\u2019s current population of over 200 million.\n\nAlso, a higher oil price from $10 per barrel to $147 per barrel in 2008 may be enough for a population of 150.3 million because of $54.9 million oil revenue, which leads to an oil revenue per capita of $0.365, but certainly not in 2021.\n\nIn the face of dwindling incomes, the government has held on to petrol subsidy against the call for full deregulation.\n\n\u201cNigeria is like a man who is dying from dehydration despite being in the midst of a ferocious rainfall,\u201d said economist Festus Ogbobine.\n\nThe struggle against subsidy has a strong historical socio-political context, in which organised labour is central. \u2018Occupy Nigeria\u2019, which has become a reference in civil unrest, shut down the country for almost two weeks in 2012 following the government\u2019s first bold step at ending petrol subsidy, which the Goodluck Jonathan administration said claimed $18 billion in 2011.\n\nRecent attempts at ending the age-long social scheme with the petrol consumption figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres have been similarly stalled by endless negotiations between the government and labour unions.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. For me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years,\u201d Timipre Sylva, the minister of state petroleum resources, said recently.\n\nIf the government bites the bullet and deregulates the downstream sector, the challenges in the oil and gas sector may not end. It will, however, free some resources for other timely infrastructure interventions, experts have noted.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show Nigeria spent N758.1 billion to cater for the cost of petroleum shortfall in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAccording to the document, Nigeria incurred a subsidy cost of N210.3 billion in January 2022, N219.783 billion in February, and N328.004 billion in March.\n\nAnalysts have long said the subsidy cost is denying the country value that could have accrued from higher oil prices.",

          "text": "Nigerian car dealers and users, who originally would have heaved a sigh of relief with the reduction of import duty on used vehicles from 35 per cent to 20 percent, had their hopes dashed with the reintroduction of the 15 percent National Automotive Council (NAC) levy on imported used cars.\n\nThis development has resulted in a fresh round of controversy at the nation\u2019s seaport between the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), car dealers, and the freight forwarders.\n\nThe controversy started after the NCS announced two weeks back that it had reviewed the duty on imported used cars from 35 percent down to 20 percent, but went further to add another 15 percent NAC levy, which enabled the Customs to regain the 15 percent that was reduced from the former import duty on cars.\n\nAccording to Timi Bomodi, public relations officer at Customs, the new tariff was in line with the tariff adjustments as stipulated in the Common External Tariff (CET) of the Economic Community of West African States protocol, which Nigeria is a signatory to.\n\nWith the new policy, car dealers bringing in used cars, popularly known as \u2018tokunbo\u2019, into the country would be expected to pay 20 percent import duty plus 15 percent NAC levy, amounting to 35 percent duty.\n\nGiving insight into the issue, Lewis Ogunojemite, a former Customs officer, who faulted the controversial 15 percent NAC levy imposed on imported vehicles, described it as an illegal collection.\n\nHe said Customs brought down the import duty on used vehicles to 20 percent from 35 percent \u201cto give the impression that they are complying with the ECOWAS protocol, only for them to go back door to introduce a 15 percent NAC levy in an attempt to retain the old duty rate of 35 percent.\u201d\n\nHe said the CET, which the NCS said it wanted to start implementing with the new tariff regime, had been in existence in Nigeria since 2009, but the country never implemented it.\n\nAccording to him, the CET agreement states that no country will charge more than 20 percent on used cars, but Nigeria had in the past placed a 35 percent duty on imported vehicles, which is wrong.\n\n\u201cIt is now in this dispensation that ECOWAS is putting its feet down that Nigeria must comply with the protocol; that was why Customs returned used vehicles to 20 percent and put the 15 percent they removed from the duty as NAC levy,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Trouble trails Customs 15% NAC levy on imported used cars\n\nOn the NAC levy, Ogunojemite said the policy was formulated to protect the 36 companies registered to manufacture vehicles in Nigeria but some of them were bringing in new vehicles into the country as made-in-Nigeria cars.\n\nHe said the NAC policy only recommended a 2 percent levy to encourage local production of vehicles, adding that \u201cthe 15 percent NAC levy is an illegal collection that shows the government is playing tricks on its citizens\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Kayode Farinto, the national vice president of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), said that imposing a 15 percent NAC levy on used vehicles was an \u2018aberration\u2019, and freight forwarders would fight against but not through strikes.\n\nAccording to him, the levy is supposed to be 2 percent of cost, insurance, and freight on new vehicles or spare parts, and not used vehicles.\n\nHe, however, said that ANLCA would be engaging with the Federal Ministry of Finance, which is the ministry overseeing Customs, on the issue.\n\nGeorge Okafor, chairman of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders PTML chapter, said, \u201cThe policy is wrong because Customs is not supposed to calculate the NAC levy on used vehicles. The levy is for new vehicles, and not old or used vehicles.\u201d\n\nThis development is coming seven weeks after the suspension of a two-week strike embarked on by registered freight forwarders over the issues around the introduction of the controversial Vehicle Identification Number valuation policy by the NCS.\n\nMany of the aggrieved freight forwarders and car dealers would embark on another strike to protest the new levy at the end of the Ramadan season, said Rilwan Amuni, chairman of the ANLCA Task Force.",

Remember that at the Jos convention, late former Governor Abubakar Rimi of Kano State said he agreed with the party but said as a Nigerian he would contest and the party did not stop him.\n\n\u201cRecently at the national convention, the party decided to zone certain offices. You will recall that at the national convention, three positions were contested: deputy chairman (North) deputy chairman (South), and national youth leader.\u201d\n\nThe PDP spokesman stated that a 37-member committee led by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State had submitted its report which would then be considered by the National Executive Committee of the PDP on Wednesday next week.\n\nHowever, he said that the NEC \u2013 which is the highest decision-making body of the party \u2013 would be the one to decide on whether there should be zoning or not.\n\nHe assured all contestants that regardless of the decision of the NEC, they would still be allowed to contest.\n\nReacting to the zoning controversy, Obi\u2019s Media Adviser, Mr. Valentine Obienyem, said it would be unjust for the South-East to be denied the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nThe Spokesman for Obi said it was regrettable that the party had decided to jettison the zoning arrangement of the party.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The executive secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Arc Sonny Echono, has called for more investment in primary and secondary schools to enhance the pursuit of purposive tertiary education, tailored towards meeting the needs of the society.\n\nEchono, who spoke in Abuja while receiving education correspondents on a visit to his office, noted that if Nigeria could address its educational problems, it would ultimately address the problem of unemployment, criminalities, hopelessness and social vices, among others.\n\nHe also decried the failure of politicians to prioritise education at the national level as they do at private, personal level where they send their children abroad for schooling at a very high cost.\n\nEchono lamented that politicians prefer to invest in road, market and other infrastructures which they can use to bolster their campaigns at the next election, adding that a good governor who invests in education, understands that the fruits of those seeds he is planting may come forward between 12 and 16 years when his two terms would have expired.\n\n\u201cTertiary, despite being my primary responsibility, I would tell you, is even the secondary priority to basic. We must invest so that every child in this country has at least an opportunity to learn how to read and write.\n\n\u201cOnce you have that solid foundation, you can begin to build on it, and tertiary education is at the apex of that building. At that point now you are investing; you are deciding to develop human capital in view of meeting a need within the society, and that need can be met profitably. So, you begin to reap the reward of your education after tertiary education,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile stating that the best investment anyone can leave for his children is education, he said many politicians are not interested in education because there are no tangible results to see from their investments during their time in office.\n\n\u201cA lot of parents make a lot of sacrifices trying to train their children. Some even labour to train them abroad. But when it comes to the national stage, our tendency is not to prioritise education as we would have done at the private personal level,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the benefits of education, he said \u201cWe all must accept the reality that if we address this education we are talking about, you would address ultimately; make education effective; teach them skills, make them understand entrepreneurship, and you would address unemployment in that process. An educated man will always find something to do. That way, your are able to address hopelessness which is the source of all sorts of deviant behaviour.\n\n\u201cWhen people begin to take drugs, commit suicide, carry out all sorts of violent crimes, they are people who do not have any sense, they are not holding unto anything. There is no value for them. There is no civilization for them to protect because they don\u2019t feel part of their system.\n\n\u201cAn educated person is less likely to be brainwashed into things like insurgency, recruited to commit crime; kidnapping, and banditry. And when you are educated you also have something to do, you have skills to be able to do something. It\u2019s an alternative to people who are hopeless and don\u2019t have anything to do. And then you see, their idle minds are the devil\u2019s workshop.\n\n\u201cSo, if they don\u2019t have an option, they would go to crime, vices, prostitution for ladies, cult and all other things that boys do these days, ritual killings and so on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we rely a lot on the media to continue to sensitise Nigerians on the importance of education to the child in the society. Look at the girl child education for example, when you train that girl child, she becomes a mother. From the very beginning, she understands personal hygiene, she understands the meaning of vaccination of children against polio, communicable diseases and others.\n\n\u201cTheir children tend to survive better than the illiterate mothers. Issues of personal hygiene, water, cleaning and all of that, they are aware of it and this translates directly. They are also more likely to send their own children to school because they now appreciate the value of education. So, you have a multiplier effect. They build on that. They also have the capacity to contribute to the family income.\n\n\u201cEven where they do not go to work outside, the knowledge they have will give them the opportunity of running economic activities, businesses, even within. These are the things we want you to help our people to understand, and if they understand that they would be willing to accept that there should be additional funding for education across boards.\n\n\u2026To Strengthen Investments In Varsities\n\nThe executive secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Sonny Echono, an architect, has said that with the support of the federal government, the organisation plans to reinforce huge investments in thirteen new universities.\n\nThis is to fast track their rate of progress, with a view to achieving the purpose of establishing them.\n\nEchono, who stated this at the weekend when the governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja, said one of his primary goals was to make tertiary institutions places that would produce entrepreneurs.\n\nHe said investments in creating entrepreneurs would go a long way in curbing the menace of unemployment and consequently tackle the socio-economic problems prevalent in the country.\n\nHe restated the present administration\u2019s full support to education, adding that this is evident in the recent presidential approval of upward review of education tax from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent, which he said would enable TETFund to cope with increasing demands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said the education tax would likely increase to three per cent as the government brings in educational investment, adding that it would go into expanding the frontiers of education in the country.\n\n\u201cThe increased tax would facilitate the implementation of more developmental projects in the education sector,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive secretary expressed appreciation at the show of support from Governor Lalong, while pledging continued commitment to the development of tertiary education in the state.\n\nEarlier in his remark, Governor Simon Lalong lauded the fund for the numerous iconic projects dotting the tertiary institutions in plateau State, saying TETFUND has become a lifeline for the schools.\n\nLalong sought the continuity of the good work by the Fund expressing his appreciation for its contribution to the development of education in the state and the northern region of Nigeria at large.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that the newly appointed Executive Secretary of the Fund, who he described as an educationist, with his track record as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Education would keep up the good work of his predecessor, Prof. Elias Bogoro ,who the Governor added that made a lot of impact in the development of tertiary institutions across Nigeria.\n\nAssuring Echono of his support in discharging his duties, Lalong said as the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum , he would make sure the Executive Secretary got the support of other northern governor\u2019s.\n\nThe director office of the executive secretary, Arc.Uchendu Wogu in a vote of thanks noted that all the good works by TETFUND as identified by the Governor were the mandate of the Agency ,which is obligatory to fulfill.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the institutions in the State for their transparency in utilizing their allocated funds,making it possible to attract more funds for the development of the institutions.",

          "title": "APC, PDP Nomination Fees: Brace For Win-at-all-cost Politics, Third Force Warns",
          "text": "Leaders of the third force movement under the umbrella of the National Consultative Front (NCFront) yesterday told Nigerians to prepare for a win at all cost politics in 2023 following what it called the excessive and outrageous monetisation of the electioneering process by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nCondmeming the high fees charged by the two parties, head of public affairs for NCFront, Dr Tanko Yunusa, said the 3rd Force strongly perceives these fees imposed by the two dominant political parties as discriminatory and corruptive.\n\nYunusa, in a statement, lamented that the two parties fixed such exorbitant prices despite the anguish that exists in the country resulting from the harsh economic situation in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the \u201cimpending consequences of these prohibitive fees imposed on aspirants as the desperate acts of APC and PDP aspirants to win at all costs is clearly caused by the payment of these exhorbitant fees.\u201d\n\nYunusa continued, \u201cThe imposition of N100 million and N40 million on presidential aspirants by APC and PDP respectively speaks eloquently to the retrogressive politics that the Nigerian ruling class has been systematically perpetuating by monetizing political mandate of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is not strange to us that both the APC and the PDP now place more premium on money rather than other critical values like character and competence for aspirants that seek political offices.\n\n\u201cThe irrationality of the imposition of prohibitive fees on aspirants can be seen in the light of the worsening official corruption at all levels of governance.\n\n\u201cIt amounts to a mockery of our democracy for any political party to enforce regulations that places the political space under the exclusive control of moneybags and highest bidders, especially in the hands of incumbent political office holders who will be left with no option than to engage in unwholesome mandate buying only to device a crooked means of recuping their political investments.\u201d\n\nHe added that the imposition of exorbitant fees on those seeking public offices cannot be defended at a time when national revenue is dwindling, prompting reliance on local and foreign loans to implement its budget.\n\nHe added that it is also disturbing that individuals aspiring to political offices are encouraged to incur such huge expenses at a time that Nigerians are clamouring for a downward review of the salaries and allowances of public office holders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA critical look reveals that a presidential candidate that doles out N100m to secure a party\u2019s ticket would need to earn a gross minimum of N25m annually in minimum 4 years that he is to be in office to recover his or her money; yet we know that the official salary of the President is much less. So does this imply that he is already encouraged to dip his hand in the government purse if only to recover the money for primaries, not to talk of other expenses for the main election. Nigeria cannot survive the booby trap of political monetization as being exhibited today across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, monetizing the political process with humongous costs would result in more inflation and the cost of winning elections and doing legitimate business in Nigeria would further skyrocket.\n\n\u201cNCFront therefore calls on Nigerians to express their outrage and opposition to this mindless and open handed corruption of the political process by both APC and PDP as this demonstration of criminal opulence by the political class in APC and PDP should not be allowed to stand in the face of extreme insecurity and harsh economic situation in the country today.\n\n\u201cAs Nigerians, we must take necessary steps to take back our country and restore sanity in the electoral process by massively rejecting both APC and the PDP at the polls in 2023 to save our national patrimony from being further plundered. This is why the 3rd Force is calling on Nigerians, particularly the electorate, to team up with our emergent People\u2019s alternative political platform, evolving into a robust 3rd Force Party, with the ultimate aim of wresting power from both APC and PDP.\n\n\u201cNigerians home and abroad are hereby enjoined to urgently team up with our 3rd force movement been championed by Leaders of Conscience, who are resolute to offer a formidable political platform for credible candidates to neutralize and defeat APC and PDP by the massive support of Nigerians at the next general elections,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Kogi state governor and one of the presidential aspirants of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Yahaya Bello, Wednesday said all ethics, rules and regulation of the party were in his favour, and therefore not afraid of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s entrance into the race.\n\nGovernor Bello stated this while picking the party\u2019s N100 million Expression of Interest and Nomination forms at the Muhammadu Buhari House of the APC National Secretariat in Abuja.\n\nSimilarly, Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, also obtained the forms to contest for the nation\u2019s top job on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nAnd as the two presidential aspirants were obtaining the forms, about $75,000 was stolen within the premises of the party\u2019s national secretariat in the midst of a mammoth crowd of aspirants and their supporters.\n\nThe incident, according to Blueprint\u2019s findings, happened when an unidentified chieftain of the party was struggling to gain entrance into the premises of the Buhari House at the main gate of the secretariat located at 40 Blantyre Street, Wuse 11 Wednesday morning.\n\nIn the process, it was further gathered, his GSM phone and the brown envelope containing the money fell off him, following which an unidentified person in the crowd picked them up and disappeared.\n\nAn eyewitness told our correspondent that the party chieftain who lost the money was seen shouting and running helter-skelter without getting any attention from anybody.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the incident led to the dismantling of tents arranged for the party officials in charge of the nomination forms, and their subsequent relocation to the International Conference Centre (ICC) for the continuation of the sale of forms.\n\nBello speaks\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after picking the forms, Governor Bello promised to unite and secure the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians are happy and the party is happy. Right now, what we have ahead of us is the task of canvassing and consulting all party faithful, leaders, stalwarts, members and even all Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora. Give us your support to emerge as the flag bearer of this great party come 30th and 31st of May 2023 and by the grace of God, I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table and restoring hope to entire Nigeria and the entire black race, Africa, as a continent and the entire black people across the world. That is the hope we are bringing on board to unite, to secure, and to put our country and its people on the path of progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to speak about the alleged plot to adopt former President Jonathan as the consensus candidate of APC, Bello said: \u201cThat is the beauty of democracy. In democracy, anybody can support anyone but I am assuring you that our great party, the APC is a party that has its own ethics, rules and regulations and I know surely that all of these are in my favour and I am not in any way scared of the pedigree of anyone whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI am confident that I am in the majority, I have the women, I have the youth, I have the people living with disabilities and they are all behind me. I have leaders, I have followers and above all, I have God Almighty.\u201d\n\nNwajiuba\n\nAlso speaking, a House of Representatives member, Hon. Chidi N. Wogu, who picked the forms on behalf of the minister, described the presidential aspirant as one of the oldest and most reliable politicians.\n\n\u201cNot oldest in terms of age, he\u2019s actually a young person. And you can see a young group who are supporting him. This is actually a young group because of the not-too-young-to-run act.\n\n\u201cThe president promised that this time around anyone who is going to run for presidency must be under 60 and these young people come together. When I saw their seriousness, I decided to coordinate with one group we put together the money and we have come today to show the seriousness by being the first to purchase this form and they find him credible, they find him hardworking,\u201d Wogu said.\n\nJonathan gets ultimatum\n\nMeanwhile, days after the Youths Network for Nigeria Union (YNNU) urged former President Jonathan to declare for the 2023 presidency, the group has handed the former president a seven- day ultimatum after Sallah to join the APC and declare his ambition or face over 20,000 youths who will picket his office.\n\nMembers of the pro-Jonathan group who turned up in their numbers Wednesday at a rally in Suleja, Niger state, threatened not to vacate the ex-president\u2019s office if he fails to concede to their demand, adding that the future of Nigerian youths depends on his decision.\n\nChairman of the group, Ibrahim A. Saiki, while addressing the media at the rally said: \u201cYou may recall that on Friday, 22nd April, 2023, we led over 7,500 members of our Network to \u2018a private meeting\u2019 with former President Goodluck Jonathan, urging him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhile responding to our plea, former President Jonathan urged the youths of Nigeria to get more involved in politics and asked us to \u201cwatch out\u201d his next move.\n\n\u201cSince then, the media space has been awash with reactions to ex-President Jonathan\u2019s comments, with several persons giving different interpretations. To us in YNNU, what Nigeria needs at this period of our national life is a unifier. That unifier is President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we have been mandated to, most respectfully, urge President Goodluck Jonathan to immediately progress to pick a membership form of the All-Progressives Congress, APC, from his ward in Otuoke, Bayelsa State, within seven days after Ramadan.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of seven days after Ramadan, President Goodluck Jonathan remains undecided, we shall most respectfully repeat our visit to his office for a Second meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan. It should be noted that over 20,000 of our more than 500,000-strong members across the nation have expressed the unreserved desire to participate and encamp at ex-President Jonathan\u2019s private office, and we shall remain there for as long as it may take for him to decide.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of our position, we have written President Goodluck Jonathan a letter to this effect, which was acknowledged and received by his office yesterday, April 26th, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe earnestly hope that President Goodluck Jonathan fully understands that our future depends on his decision. Therefore, we do not intend to relent in our pursuit of the true desire of Nigerians at this time- which only him can anchor.\u201d\n\nSome of the placards been displayed at the rally was emphatic on their demands. They include; \u2018Jonathan you are wasting our time\u2019, \u2018Maigidan Goodluck Jonathan, our destiny in your hand\u2019, \u2018President Jonathan declare for President Now\u2019, \u2018Goodluck Jonathan You must run\u2019, \u2018We don\u2019t care about party, any party is Ok\u2019, \u2018Jonathan run under APC Now\u2019 etc.\n\nAlso speaking, the secretary of the youth network Jonathan Akumobi and Women Leader, Mrs. Ozi-Bello Sadiq said they had been protesting since morning because they wanted Jonathan to understand the urgency of their request and the need to answer them without further delay.\n\nAccording to Akumobi, \u201cGoodluck Jonathan is a custodian of freedom of speech; he is a man with good heart. When he was the president the economy was good, the youths were employed and Nigeria was in the right direction that is why we are urging him to run.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need person not very old as president\u2019\n\nIn a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Forum of former Ministers, has insisted that the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer in the 2023 election should not be very old.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Forum while hosting the former Senate President and PDP presidential aspirant, Senator Pius Anyim, recently in Abuja, chairman of the forum and former Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Tanimu Turaki (SAN) lamented that leadership failure had affected development of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need a person that is not very old. He (Anyim) has acquired sufficient experience and maturity and he is not also very young. So, he can relate with some of us that are young.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that has the courage to take decisive decisions because Nigerian needs a very strong and powerful president. We need a man of integrity, a person that will listen, a person that will be compassionate, a person that will show sympathy and empathy to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe greatest problem we have had in this country is leadership failure because leadership has failed in this country and because the head of the fish is rotten; ultimately and quite invariably, the body of the fish will also be rotten.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that we must take special interest in what happens to our party in the build up to this election. We will play a very active role, we will liaise with the leadership of the party in selecting a credible candidate that will win election for us and win election for Nigeria and in the process, salvage Nigerians from the twin evils of hunger and poverty.\u201d\n\nTuraki, who stressed that Nigeria needed Anyim\u2019s experience, added: \u201cBetween the experience you have gathered both from the legislative and executive arms of government and of course while you have never had the opportunity of heading or playing a pivotal role in the judiciary; your qualification as a senior lawyer now fills that gap and makes you one person that has the opportunity of gravitating and serving from both arms of government in this country.\u201d\n\nAddressing the former ministers, Anyim, who was also a Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said he had the required experience to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I worked as a civil servant, it was in two parastatals in the Presidency. I worked as President of the Senate, working along with the President to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cI worked as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the engine room of the Presidency. My experiences are cognate. I am not going to learn on the job; I am going to continue from where we stopped.\n\n\u201cLet me also say that today in Nigeria, we are concerned about things that are not going well. There is insecurity, there is economic downturn. The first commitment I want to offer Nigerians is to stand on the framework of consensus and reunite Nigerians and reduce mutual suspicion,\u201d he pledged.\n\n\u201cWhen we are able to redirect the nation on the path of unity and eliminate mutual suspicion, all of us will come together, pick the right hands based on competence and capacity and work together to refocus the economy, rescue the country and rebuild our society.\u201d\n\nPresent at the meeting were Elder Godsday Orubebe, Labaran Maku, Solomon Ewuga, Sanusi Dagash and Josephine Anenih.\n\nOthers included Ina Ciroma, Mukhtar Shehu Shagari and Osita Chidoka among others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

They promised to make adequate use of the money given to them to enhance their businesses and also assured to keep to the conditions of paying back the loans as at when due.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, has said the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) cannot dictate to the Federal Government what platform to be used in paying their salaries.\n\nHe stated this in Abuja while addressing journalists shortly after receiving his presidential Nomination Form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) purchased for him by the Project Nigeria Group.\n\n\u201cIt is impractical and incongruous to continuously expect that somebody who is paid a salary continues to dictate to the someone who pays him: \u2018This is how you must pay me\u2019. This is where this anomaly is,\u201d the minister said.\n\nMr Nwajiuba also appealed to the striking lecturers to return to the classroom as the Federal Government is working to address some of their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have pleaded with ASUU that \u2018If there any areas where your salaries fall short, kindly address them within the ambit of IPPIS because that\u2019s what the government has now,'\u201d the presidential hopeful explained.\n\nRELATED\n\nNavy, EFCC Reject Senate\u2019s Bill To Criminalise Paying Ransom To Kidnappers\n\nYou Can\u2019t Spend N200bn On Universities, But Can Spend N4trn On Fuel Subsidy \u2013 ASUU Tackles FG\n\n\u2018Go Back To Classes\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the strike embarked upon by ASUU was uncalled for, and expressed worry over the impact of the union\u2019s action on the education of Nigerian students.\n\n\u201cWhy they have chosen to go on strike over this (IPPIS) is what you and I can explain. There is nothing that ASUU wants that we have not agreed to. We would like them to go back to classes so that students can go back to class,\u201d Nwajiuba added.\n\n\u201cAs the nation earns, we pay them. As the nation makes money, they would get money. What we don\u2019t want is for the children to miss the opportunity of their own time because there is a timeframe within which children must grow. The child cannot wait. It is important that ASUU returns to class.\u201d\n\nThe minister\u2019s comment adds to the continued debates over the payment systems for lecturers in public universities across the country. While the union says its University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) should be used for payment, the Federal Government maintains that the payment system has not met its technical requirements.\n\nBut ASUU, which down tools over two months ago, believes the government is paying lip service to the lecturers\u2019 agitation.\n\nAccording to the union\u2019s president, Emmanuel Osodeke, the government\u2019s budgeting of N4trn for subsidy payment is an indication that it is not ready to resolve the crisis.\n\n\u201cYou can raise N4 trillion for fuel subsidy in a year, but you cannot raise N200 billion to fund your education because you don\u2019t have money; it is a priority,\u201d he told Channels Television when he featured on Sunrise Daily last week.\n\n\u201cYou can spend N228 billion to feed children in primary and secondary schools, but you cannot raise N200 billion to fund your universities; it is an issue of priority, that is the problem.\u201d\n\nASUU, among others, is fighting for increased funding for public schools as well as the usage of UTAS to pay the lecturers\u2019 salaries.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Senate Amends Terrorism Act, Prohibits Payment of Ransom to Kidnappers",
          "text": "As part of efforts to avert the imminent placement of Nigeria in the International Cooperation and Review Group Process of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its looming sanctions on the economy, the Senate on Wednesday passed a bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, as well as prohibit payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nThat was as former military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of passengers abducted by terrorists during the Kaduna train attack. Umar made the appeal in a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna.\n\nThe passage of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nChairman of the committee, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central), explained, \u201cThe need to comprehensively review the Terrorism Prevention Act arose from the unfavourable ratings of FATF recommendations of Nigeria\u2019s Mutual Evaluation Report and consequent placement of Nigeria in FATF\u2019s International Cooperation and Review Group Process with its impending sanctions on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the National Task Force on improving Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in Nigeria had proposed improvement on the Act in order to address the deficiencies noted in its provisions and align it with the required standard obtainable in other jurisdictions.\n\nTwo months ago, the federal government disclosed that it had uncovered 123 companies and 96 other entities linked to terrorism financing. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the companies included 33 Bureaux De Change (BDC). Mohammed also stated that the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit uncovered the suspected companies and individuals.\n\nThe companies, which were alleged to be conduit for movement of money by terrorists, are yet to be tried by the federal government.\n\nIn the past few days, there have been increasing attacks by different terrorist groups across the country, with several lives lost, scores injured, and many kidnapped or missing and unaccounted for.\n\nCurbing terrorism financing has remained a hard nut to crack for the Nigerian government either due to lack of political will or gaps in legislation. This has exacerbated insecurity and fear, what with the attempted attack on the Kaduna airport, attack on a Kaduna-bound train, and attack on security personnel and formations, all recently, as well as other nefarious activities by terrorist groups.\n\nA recent report by the Financial Derivatives Company Limited revealed that in the past decade, an estimated 87,903 persons had died through assaults by Boko Haram, sectarian actors, and other armed bandits in the country, with a lot of Nigerians now living in fear.\n\nBamidele, in his presentation, said the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, sought to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers, and terrorists for release of any person who had been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cThe overall import of this bill is to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom in Nigeria, which is fast spreading across the country.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the memoranda presented to the committee, a plethora of issues relating to terrorism and terrorism financing, in line with global best practices, were raised. He assured that the amendment to the terrorism law would set standards and the regulatory system intended to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks.\n\nBamidele added, \u201cHaving policies in place to combat financing of terrorism will surely reduce or eliminate privacy and anonymity in financial and other sundry transactions as it relates to the subject in our society.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he emphasised that the proposed repeal and enactment bill was geared towards improving the effectiveness of countermeasures against terrorism, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.\n\nThe senator noted that the repeal was aimed at providing adequate framework for improved international collaboration, inter-agency cooperation, and freezing of terrorist funds/assets.\n\nBamidele stated, \u201cThe passage of this bill will save Nigeria from being included among countries in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List with its attendant negative consequences, which might ultimately result to international sanctions that would affect the image of the country in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said it would complement the federal government\u2019s efforts in the fight against insecurity, when signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLawan said, \u201cIt is our belief here in the Senate that this bill, by the time signed into an Act by Mr. President, will enhance the efforts of this government in the fight against terrorism, kidnapping, and other associated and related vices.\n\n\u201cThis is one piece of legislation that can turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have done so much as a government, in terms of infrastructural development across all parts of this country, but because the security situation is not the kind of situation that we all want, this tends to overshadow all the tremendous and massive developments in our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the executive will waste no time in signing this bill into law, and it is our hope that this additional piece of legislation will achieve the purpose for which it has been worked upon by the Senate, and, indeed, the National Assembly, and for which it would also be signed by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear here, that the fight against insecurity, whether it is kidnapping, terrorism or whatsoever, is not the sole role of a government.\n\n\u201cThe contribution and support by citizens is essential, because our security agencies need vital and critical information against terrorism and other things that make life difficult for us.\u201d\n\nThe upper chamber passed the bill after it scaled Third Reading on the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate, thereafter, adjourned plenary till May 10, for the Sallah break.\n\nUmar Urges FG to Ensure Immediate Release of Kidnapped Victims of Kaduna Train Attack\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd), appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, yesterday, Umar said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, remained disturbing.\n\nUmar also appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.\u201d\n\nOn March 28, terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train and killed eight people, while several others were injured. Many people were abducted and are being held in captivity by the terrorists.\n\nOne of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack on the Kaduna bound train had been delivered of her baby,.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62.\n\nThe gunmen had ambushed the train heading for Kaduna from the nation\u2019s capital after bombing its rail track.\n\nARISE News had quoted the terrorists as insisting that they were not after a ransom, but exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were allegedly in government custody.\n\nA family source confirmed that one of the two pregnant women among the kidnapped victims had given birth in the terrorists\u2019 den with the help of doctors invited by the gang.\n\nSources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development that is still shocking to both the government and security operatives.\n\nMichael Olugbode, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "With the presidential primaries of political parties about a month from now and the election proper less than a year away, some of the nation\u2019s prominent political and business leaders, have literally moved to Saudi Arabia for lesser Hajj, not just prayers but to ponder the options open to them and the nation ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe latest personality and political heavyweight to join other Nigerian leaders in prayer at a high octane networking, is the former governor of Lagos State and frontline presidential hopeful, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was though in Mecca for the Umrah as with others, however, found the atmosphere conducive for political networking, as usual.\n\nApart from Tinubu, who just arrived Saudi Arabia for the conventional last 10 days of Ramadan as an optional Islamic practice, others who also left for lesser hajj were former Vice-President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; Africa\u2019s richest man and Chairman of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; Founder and Chairman of BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu and former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Malam Nuhu Ribadu.\n\nSome of the other known political names seen in Saudi Arabia, included former Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to Ghana, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, who is itching to be redistricted to Lagos West, from Central, where he initially represented, for another senatorial bid and a former two-time Senator for Lagos West, Ganiyu Olanrewaju Solomon.\n\nTraditionally, while some devout Muslims travel for Umrah to seal the last 10 days of Ramadan in supplication to Allah, Nigerian politicians, have also found in the practice, an opportunity to broker and seal political deals, design strategies for elections, and mull options open to them, either collectively or individually.\n\nParticularly, this has become a political culture in Lagos State, where Tinubu was governor for eight years and has continued to dominate its politics in the last 23 years.\n\nDuring political seasons, an average Lagos politician with ambition struggles, almost compulsorily, to be at the lesser hajj, since it is most likely the place, where crucial political decisions, relating to the career and future of others, would be taken, and often, whatever deal sealed in Saudi remains unchangeable.\n\nThus, Tinubu, who described his presidential aspiration as a life-long ambition, had set the standard for the campaign pattern ahead of 2023, when he started traveling round the country for consultations and to seek the blessings of prominent Nigerians for his aspiration.\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that for an avowed kingmaker, who decided to throw his hat into the ring, joining other like-minds for Umrah, both for prayers and political networking, was almost a question of when.\n\nSeen exchanging banter with others in Saudi after a video of him and Ribadu went viral, many believed that this meeting in the holy land before the elections, would afford Tinubu an opportunity to review his ambition and consider some of the options still open to him.\n\n\u201cObviously we all met in Mecca here for Umrah by accident and. Not that this was planned. But, as usual, such a gathering always affords us the opportunity to critically look at the state of the nation, particularly, now being an election season. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 all networking and programming for the 2023 elections,\u201d said one of the political leaders, who is also in Saudi for Umrah.",

          "text": "At the resumed hearing on the suit by Governor Nyesom Wike against THISDAY newspaper and others on alleged libel on Wednesday, the defense witness, Mr. Jude Igbanoi, presented more video evidence to show the unreliability of the state governor.\n\nThe video further showed that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was not libelous. Igbanoi also rejected the assertion by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the publication was reckless, insisting that the publication was fair comment on a matter of public interest.\n\nThe court watched video of Wike as the Director General of Godwin Obaseki Campaign Organisation campaigning for Obaseki\u2019s re-election and saying good things about Obaseki only to turn round a few years later to be attacking his character. The court also watched video clips of Wike as the Director General of Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s campaign organisation, where he was praising the former governor of Rivers State to high heaven only for him to change and started attacking him which THISDAY argued buttresses his (Wike\u2019s) unreliability.\n\nDuring the cross examination, the witness, Igbanoi, argued that the publication by THISDAY did not make Wike\u2019s political associates and friends to shun or abandon him. The publication did affect his relationships and did not make him lose any privilege or opportunities that would have come his way. He was appointed Director General of Obaseki Campaign Organisation despite the publication an indication that the publication clearly did not injure his public perception.\n\nThe court at the end of the cross examination of the first witness for the defendant adjourned till May 20, to begin cross examination of the second witness.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY outside the courtroom, the defense counsel, Tuduru Edeh, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, explained that: \u201cThe sitting yesterday concentrated on playing exhibit F and L, which were videos namely where Wike was campaigning for Amaechi as his campaign director for his governorship election and he praised Amaechi to high heavens.\n\n\u201cIt was played to demonstrate that, that was the position he had, but it is a different story today having fallen out with Amaechi.\n\n\u201cThe first video was to show that even though the man claimed libels but going through the videos you see a man who was made Director General of Obaseki\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nEdeh added that: \u201cThe witness emphasised that he (Wike) was not shunned, political associates did not abandon him as a result of the publication he is complaining about.\n\n\u201cThe matter was adjourned till May 20 for continuation of hearing, for us to bring our second witness.\u201d\n\nJustice Adolphus Enebeli of the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, adjourned till May 20, 2022 to continue hearing on the suit.\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the matter, the lead counsel to Wike, Emmanuel Ukala, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, put to the witness for the defendant that the publication made by THISDAY was reckless and could negatively affect the image of the claimant.\n\nLast month, the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had also watched video clips tendered by THISDAY. Then, in the video clips presented by Igbanoi and played in the courtroom, he had in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements opened his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments. He had argued that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion suit against THISDAY and three of its staff, claiming that the newspaper publication of June 23, 2020, with caption:\u201dWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\nThe governor had claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\nWike had also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.",
