          "text": "The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the forthcoming Anambra State governorship poll scheduled for November 6, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, has said the state was too sophisticated for a school certificate holder to aspire to govern.\n\nSoludo, who spoke at the Dr Alex Ekwueme Square in Awka, the state capital, on Friday, during the inauguration of the APGA National Campaign Council for Anambra poll, said the state had outgrown being governed with such lowly educational qualification.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission had on Thursday published a list of candidates for the Anambra Governorship election wherein most of the candidates presented secondary school certificates as their highest qualifications.\n\nSoludo said, \u201cAPGA has a star-studded team for this election and it is the party with the best brains.\n\n\u201cLook at other political parties and their candidates, and you will find out that they have just first school leaving certificate and others the West African Senior School Certificate as their highest qualification.\n\n\u201cIs it first school leaving certificate and WASSCE they will use to govern Anambra? Anambra has outgrown such and you cannot use those certificates to govern Anambra. Look at my running mate, Dr Onyekachi Ibezim, a medical doctor. You can\u2019t beat our team.\u201d\n\nSoludo also thanked God for the Appeal Court judgment that gave him victory over Chuma Umeoj, who was earlier published by INEC as the party\u2019s candidate, adding that with the judgment, there was no longer anything like faction in APGA.\n\nHe added, \u201cAPGA will contest for every vote, in every ward, in every church, in every local government, and we are confident of victory.\u201d\n\nThe APGA National Chairman, Dr Victor Oye, said, \u201cAPGA has grown above destruction. We are warning those who are working towards destroying the party to desist from doing so, or they will be destroyed.\n\n\u201cAnambra people have spoken, and they want Soludo. Let those contesting against Soludo bring their certificates, let\u2019s see. We have a candidate that had first class (degrees) at every level of his education. He is a renowned professor of Economics and a former Central Bank of Nigeria governor.\n\n\u201cLet that candidate who is assembling governors from everywhere to come to Anambra show us his certificate first. He has none. We will remain steadfast and continue to pray and hope that the victory trumpet will sound on November 6. Soludo has won the election already and we are confident of it.\n\nMeanwhile, the state governor, Willie Obiano, was named as the chairman of the APGA national campaign council for the poll.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Federal Government, on Friday, announced that it had commenced the process for the second phase of the National Mass Metering Programme that would lead to the distribution of four million meters.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Infrastructure, Ahmad Zakari, said in a statement issued in Abuja that the government had concluded arrangements for the commencement of the second phase of the NMMP aimed at reducing estimated billing by power distributors.\n\nHe said the programme would ensure that consumers were billed appropriately for the electricity they consumed through the installation of free meters in unmetered households and business premises.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cIn preparation for the second phase (known as Phase 1) of the NMMP, the Nigerian electricity sector regulator has conducted extensive consultations and stakeholder management, and has revised its metering guidelines.\n\n\u201cThis phase will provide up to four million meters and shall also use a similar financing mechanism as phase zero.\u201d\n\nThe presidential aide said the Federal Government provided funding for the programme through loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Discos, as meters were provided to customers free of charge.\n\n\u201cOne of the key successes of the NMMP initiative is how rapidly it has increased private sector interest in investing in the local meter assembly, manufacturing and installation space.\u201d\n\nThe first phase (phase zero) was inaugurated later than expected in December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a target of one million meters.\n\nZakari said a total of 750,000 meters had so far been delivered to Discos in eight months under the first phase of the NMMP.\n\n\u201cThis is a marked improvement in terms of the speed of installation of meters compared to its predecessor (Meter Asset Provider programme), which recorded 350,000 meter installations in over 18 months,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the management of the Benin Electricity Distribution Company has it is offering discounts on outstanding debt ranging from five per cent to 25 per cent to customers in its franchise area.\n\nThe firm said it took the decision in view of the economic situation of the country, particularly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, BEDC, Funke Osibodu, who disclosed this in Benin during a media parley, said the discount known as Debt Rescheduling Scheme was to ensure that customers who subscribed were not disconnected and were given accelerated metering process.\n\n\u201cRecognising the financial difficulties that customers are going through, especially during this period of COVID 19, BEDC has begun a Debt Rescheduling Scheme for customers in its coverage areas.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a soft-landing approach for customers to settle their outstanding debts on electricity consumption as we offer discounts ranging from five per cent to 25 per cent, down payment of 25 per cent, with balance payable over four years or provision of an additional five per cent discount where a customer pays off such outstanding instantly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the national mass metering programme initiated by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Osibodu said the company had taken delivery of 54,198 out of the 75,870 meters allocated to BEDC for distribution, adding that 40,000 meters had been installed by BEDC across the four states covered by the company.\n\nWhile emphasising that the meter and its installation were free and that it had been paid for, the MD warned customers not to pay money to anyone in the name of getting meter or its installation.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Grazing Routes: Buhari turning Nigeria into a cow republic, prioritizing welfare of cows over human lives \u2013 Ortom",
          "text": "By Peter Duru \u2013 Makurdi\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue state, weekend, said the insistence of the federal government to carve out grazing routes and reserves for herdsmen across 25 states despite resistance by Nigerians is a final onslaught on the people and an invitation to crisis and anarchy.\n\nHe observed that it was obvious that the presidency seemed not bothered by the worsening insecurity in the country leading to killings by bandits, armed herders and terrorists but preferred to deploy government arsenal to forcefully impose such a policy on Nigerians who had kicked against it.\n\nThe Governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Terver Akase in Makurdi said it was shocking and disappointing to read a statement from the Presidency indicating that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved recommendations of a committee to review \u2018with dispatch\u2019 368 grazing sites across 25 states in the country, \u2018to determine the levels of encroachment.\u2019\n\nHe said it was clear that the Presidency wanted to plunge the country into avoidable crisis because there was no justification for the President Muhammadu Buhari to insist on establishing reserves and routes for cattle against the widely accepted ranching policy.\n\nThe Governor in the statement said \u201cmillions of Nigerians have been displaced following attacks by armed herders and are currently suffering in IDP camps. Benue State for instance has over 1.5 million displaced people with thousands living in camps and many more forced to flee their ancestral lands to stay under dehumanizing conditions in open fields.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration does not seem to be worried about the food crisis already ravaging the country. Farmers have been chased into IDP camps by herders and children are dying of starvation in addition to being denied education, yet what is more important to the President is the well being of cows.\n\n\u201cWe expected the pitiable condition of the displaced people to be the preoccupation of the President whom they voted in 2015 and 2019. It is unfortunate that the people\u2019s genuine show of love, trust and votes for the President are being rewarded with hate, cruelty and dictatorial policies aimed at grabbing their lands to donate to herders and cows.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference between the Buhari administration\u2019s approach to insecurity and the Taliban agenda in Afghanistan?\n\n\u201cIt is now evident that the government at the centre prioritizes the welfare of cattle over human beings and is bent on taking Nigeria back to the precolonial era with some snippets of a society where in the words of Thomas Hobbes, life has become \u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe country has been turned to a cow republic by the present administration and the basic principles of equality, justice, fairness and equity which engender peace and suppress anarchy are non-existent.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has refused to prove wrong, those who accuse him of being a Fulani President. He has instead proven that he indeed belongs to somebody. But Buhari is not the first Fulani man to be President of this country.\n\n\u201cNigeria had Presidents Shehu Shagari and Umaru Yar\u2019Adua who were also of Fulani ethnicity; but were Presidents for all Nigerians and treated citizens of this country fairly and equitably.\n\n\u201cOur country has never been more divided on ethnic lines and sentiments as it is under President Buhari who was thought to be the most prepared to lead the country at this time. Under President Shagari and President Yar\u2019Adua, Nigerians were not chided by a horde of presidential spokesmen and social media hirelings for simply expressing their views on government policies.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the Governor said, \u201cPerhaps the President is not aware that most of the northern states, including his home state Katsina and the entire southern states have unanimously rejected open grazing of livestock and approved ranching.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency is therefore whipping a dead horse on the issue of grazing reserves. It is hypocritical for the Presidency to support and fund ranching in Katsina State and turn round to impose grazing reserves on other states.\n\nALSO READ: ANTI-OPEN GRAZING LAWS: Why are South East Governors dilly-dallying?\n\n\u201cThose saddled with the duty of advising the President have apparently failed in their responsibility. They ought to have told the President that though grazing reserves existed in some parts of the country before independence, there have been several reviews and laws which, in addition to the years of social and infrastructural development as well as population growth, have superceded and rendered the reserves null and void. Additionally, the Land Use Act provides that Governors are the custodians of all lands in their states.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has no constitutional right to appropriate lands for itself or anyone else for that matter without the approval of State Governors. Nigeria is practicing democracy; not despotism or feudalism. The President is obligated to listen to the yearnings of the people and lead according to the constitution. Leaders are elected to solve problems, not create more problems for the people.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government introduced the National Livestock Transformation Plan, NLTP and Nigerians accepted the policy. Why has the Buhari administration dumped the programme and opted for grazing reserves and cattle routes? That is the question agitating the minds of discerning Nigerians who suspect foul play.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government\u2019s posture has emboldened armed Fulani herdsmen who go about maiming and killing innocent Nigerians. That the government has turned deaf ears to calls for the licensing of responsible Nigerians to own sophisticated weapons is another pointer to a hidden motive.\n\n\u201cWe also read the President\u2019s comments yesterday at the National Security Council meeting where he threatened to sack Security Chiefs for what he termed failure to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t the Security Chiefs fail when the body language of the Commander-in-Chief points to a clan of sacred cows who must be spared and given protection to perpetuate evil? How will the Security Chiefs succeed when their formations are not well funded and the troops are left to confront terrorists who have superior weapons?\n\n\u201cWhy will the military commanders be decisive when those who kill their personnel and other Nigerians are given preferential treatment on the pretense of \u201crepentance\u201d? We hope that Mr President was misquoted. But if indeed he made the statement attributed to him, he was not being fair to the security agencies.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s spokesman Femi Adesina once asked Nigerians to choose between holding onto their lands or losing their lives. What is happening now is confirmation of that threat from the Presidency. They introduced Cattle Colonies, Ruga and National Water Resources Bill but Nigerians rejected all the policies.\n\n\u201cThe latest push for grazing reserves and cattle routes is surely the final onslaught against majority of Nigerians who must be deprived of their God-given lands to accommodate foreign herdsmen moving into the country for the occupation agenda.\n\n\u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom has repeatedly stated that there is no land for grazing reserves or cattle routes in Benue State. Though the Federal Government craftily concealed the names of the states where the President has ordered that grazing reserves be foisted on the people, we wish to categorically state that no part of Benue will be allocated for grazing reserves or cattle routes.\n\n\u201cThe stand of the Governor is not personal; it is the collective decision of Benue people. Our state should be counted out of the proposed grazing reserves programme.\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari must actualize his cattle agenda in Benue State, he should be ready to kill all of us! We know that grazing reserves and cattle routes are the only project that the President has for Nigeria, but Benue is not interested in such a project.\n\n\u201cWe are equally disappointed with members of the committee which recommended that grazing reserves be established in parts of the country. They are the real enemies of Nigeria. Theirs is hypocrisy of the highest order. Members of the committee should know that posterity will judge everyone according to their deeds here on earth. Above all, there is God and Buhari administration will not be in power forever.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Ahmed Joda passed on Friday, August 13, 2021, at the age of 91.\n\nThe delegation, which was led by the Chairman of NCC Board, Prof. Adeolu Akande included the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Commission Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, Engr. Ubale Maska, and Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Barrister Adeleke Adewolu.\n\nAlso on the visit were other Board Commissioners, including Mr. Clement Baiye, Chief Uche Onwude, Alhaji Abdulazeez Salman and Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar as well as senior Management staff of the Commission.\n\nThe NCC delegation was received by family members of the late Chairman led by his eldest son, Alhaji Ali Joda at the deceased Yola town in the Yola South Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSpeaking during the visit, Akande, who presented a condolence letter from the Hon. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami to the family, paid glowing tribute to the late Joda, and eulogized him for leaving indelible footprints on the sands of the nation\u2019s telecommunications industry.\n\nHe said the telecom industry and by extension the entire economy have benefited immensely from the solid foundation laid by the Joda-led NCC Board from 2001 to 2010, during which the sector recorded landmark achievements in terms of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which revolutionized the telecommunications landscape in Nigeria.\n\nAmplifying the voice of Akande, during the commiseration visit, Danbatta described Joda \u201cas an exceptional individual\u201d, adding that the remarkable role played by Joda had helped in transforming the NCC from what it was back in 2000 to what it is currently.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, the NCC is known across the African continent and beyond as a foremost and world-class regulatory agency. He said the sterling status achieved by NCC was due to the commitment, hard work, diligence and exceptional leadership demonstrated by Joda when he held sway as NCC Board Chairman for 10 years.\n\n\u201cNo amount of praise and tribute will be adequate to capture the immeasurable contributions of Baba Joda to the telecommunications industry in Nigeria in general, and to the Nigerian Communications Commission in particular. Baba Joda is leaving behind a robust legacy that will live after him, as he is today credited with the GSM revolution in Nigeria\u201d, Danbatta said.\n\n\u201cArising from Baba Joda\u2019s exceptional vision and robust leadership, the NCC recorded landmark achievements such as the construction of NCC\u2019s Head Office in Maitama, Abuja; the NCC\u2019s Communications & Digital Economy Complex (CDEC), Mbora, Abuja, as well as the establishment of Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), among others. These are some of the remarkable achievements recorded during his time as the Chairman of the Board\u201d, he said.\n\nIn an emotion-laden voice, Prof, Danbatta noted that Baba Joda was a father to him, describing his death as a great personal loss. He recalled how, recently, from his sick bed, Baba Joda painstakingly wrote the foreword to his (Danbatta\u2019s) Compendium of Speeches entitled \u201cCatalysing Nigeria\u2019s Socio-Economic Transformation through Broadband Infrastructure\u201d, due to be launched soon.\n\nDanbatta led the delegation in prayers for the repose of the soul of the deceased.",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nAgainst the admonition by Katsina State governor, Bello Masari to his citizens to acquire arms to defend themselves, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), the Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU) and the Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), have said the Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Igboho, and IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu have been vindicated for their efforts in defending their regions from bandits, kidnappers, killer herders and other criminals.\n\nSecretary-General of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide, said the statements by Minister of Defence, Gen Bashir Magashi (Retd), and Governor Aminu Masari on self-defence have justified the actions of agitators for self-determination. Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Igboho, is a prominent member of the Ilana Omo Oodua, championing self-determination for Yoruba nation.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThe comments by Gen Magashi and Governor Masari are by far more harmful to this nation than what Igboho would do. Igboho has not even defended himself. He has not raised arms against this country and he has not incited anybody to take up arms.\n\n\u201cIf you have the Number One citizen of a state, calling on people to breach and violate the law of the country, which forbids anybody to possess guns without licence or police permit, then there is no more hope. So, for a governor from the president\u2019s state calling on the people to defend themselves, is an admittance of government failure completely,\u201d the YCE said.\n\nLeader of Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Prof Banji Akintoye, who spoke through the Communications Manager of IOO, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, said statements have vindicated Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, and the self-determination groups that have been agitating for Yoruba nation.\n\nSaid he: \u201cWith the statements made by Masari and the earlier one made by the Defence Minister, people can now see that the Nigerian government has been speaking with both sides of their mouth. They said we should defend ourselves. And it is not a crime for you to defend yourself, when your life is in danger.\n\n\u201cBut when you defend yourself, the Nigerian government will arrest you and charge you for conspiracy, murder, illegal possession of firearms and so on. But those people that came to attack you, rape your women and girls, kill you and so on, you will not hear anything about them.\n\n\u201cIgboho never killed anyone. He never shot a gun. He never destroyed any property. He uses native intelligence to drive out the people tormenting, terrorising and oppressing his people. They want to criminalise Igboho, but they will fail. We are happy that Igboho is in a protective custody. By God\u2019s grace, he will be a free man.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of time, the collective will of the people will triumph. The people of Yorubaland will triumph and we shall have our own nation peacefully.\u201d\n\nIPOB, in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, noted that the call by the governor has vindicated Kanu, who has been consistently advising Nigerian and particularly Igbo to defend themselves against the Fulani terrorists, \u201cour leader is a man who saw tomorrow, everything he said has fully happened.\n\n\u201cThe politically correct South East governors and political elite should stop living in the past. They had better woken from their slumber and decode the obvious signals of the call by Masari.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), Chief John Mayor Echefu, said the IPOB leader saw ahead of tomorrow and warned his people of the danger that would befall them in the hands of the Fulani herdsmen, but the governors and other leaders betrayed him. He regretted that if a Southern leader had called for citizens to start bearing arms, there would have been uproar from the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Defence has called for self defence; he told Nigerians openly that they should defend themselves because government could no longer do that. The Emir of Zauzau called his subjects to defend themselves, and IPOB set up Eastern Security Network to defend their area, but they want to kill their leader,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, President of Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), Jonathan Asake, said, the statement has already vindicated Kanu and Igboho, who want to defend their areas against Fulani militia attacks.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis comment coming from Governor Masari is a welcome development and indicate two things.\n\n\u201cFirstly, that the government of the day cannot defend Nigerians and they should admit that and allow Nigerians to defend themselves and even support and empower Nigerians across the country to defend themselves if they are not part of this problem. \u201cSecondly, it shows that Igboho in the South-West and Nnamdi Kanu in the South-East have been vindicated over their agitations. Their long-standing agitation to defend their people has made a statement that they foresaw this thing long time ago. I\u2019m not surprised that many other communities in many states have come to the same conclusion,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa and Ben Dunno, Warri\n\nAs mixed reactions pour in over the President Buhari\u2019s recent signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), communities in Niger Delta region are weighing the option of going to court to challenge some controversial clauses in the Act which they considered to be inimical to the peace and progress of the region.\n\nApart from the three percent derivation which they want increased to five per cent, others include the one which says: \u201cfor a community to benefit from the three percent, there must be no pipeline vandalisation and oil theft\u201d and another which they think mandates the oil companies to take all decisions about the Host Communities Trust Fund, on behalf of the oil-producing communities.\n\nThe PIA has already caused division in the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC). While some members of the executive arm want a decisive action, the Senate arm is not interested in further agitation. The national spokesman, Ebilade Erekefe, declared President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of State for Petroluem, Timipre Sylva, persona non grata in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe accused them of being insensitive to the plight of the Niger Delta people and threatened that they would be greeted with boos and jeers anytime they come to the Niger Delta region. Disagreeing with his stance, however, the Speaker, IYC, Digimie Eldred Pogoyo urged security agencies to investigate the threat against President Buhari and Sylva by Erekefe.\n\nPogoyo who would want all agitations against the PIA to cease said the people should focus on the positive side of the law. According to him, Sylva as Minister of State has brought more development to the region more than previous ministers that have come from the region.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Chief Nengi James, who feared that the signing of the PIA could ignite anger across the Ijaw land, explained that the major problem was the lack of coordination between the people and the representatives at the National Assembly on one hand and the lack of enthusiasm by some governors on the other hand.\n\n\u201cThe people are also having mixed feelings because even if the money in increased to the percentage the people demanded, there is this fear the money if given to the governor may not even reach the host communities. The governors can collect the money and ensure that not one per cent gets to communities that produce oil but expended on communities without oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKing Bubaraye Dakolo, Adaga IV, Ibenenaowei of Ekpetiama Kingdom wants Niger Delta lawyers to head to court over the Act. Dakolo , author of \u201cThe Ri ddle of the Oil Thief\u201d and brother to Capt Perebo Dakolo, executed for his involvement in the Gideon Orkar Coup of 1990, sees the PIA as an aberration as it seeks to put a yoke on oil producing communities. According to him it is different from the one initiated, years ago.\n\n\u201cIt seeks to criminalise the people of the Niger Delta by including in its provision that for a community to benefit from the three per cent, there must be no pipeline vandalization and oil theft,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting this around the neck of oil communities is stigmatization. For over 20 years, the federal government has been fighting oil theft and they have not been able to stop it. Now, how do they expect communities that are not trained to be able to do so? The law is criminal, and most unfortunate. The SANs in the Niger Delta region should go to court and challenge it.\u201d\n\nEric Omare, President of Ijaw Youth Council, noted that there was supposed to be enthusiasm among the communities over the signing of the Bill into law but the reverse is the case. \u201cThe PIA is supposed to create a conducive environment for investors to invest but with the anger in host communities that cannot happen.\u201d\n\nThe Act is breeding disaffection, said Ken Henshaw, Executive Director, \u201cWe the People, warned. Accusing the PIA of treating oil producing communities like the subjects of oil companies by empowering these companies to take all decisions about the Host Communities Trust and Fund on behalf of oil producing communities, he urged them to challenge the provisions of the Act in the Supreme Court.\n\nA statement signed by Hon. Ken Robinson, its National Publicity Secretary, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), decried the implementation of 3 percent allocation conceded to oil producing communities, and called for its upward review.\n\n\u201cThis PIB falls way short of the expectations of the Oil and Gas Producing Communities, that bear the brunt of unconscionable industry operations,\u201d it noted. \u201c\n\nWhat this act signifies is an unequivocal message to the Niger Delta people that how they feel and what they say, do not count, at all, in the schemes of the Nigerian Project\n\nThat\u2019s insensitive, abominable and unacceptable to the good people of the Niger Delta, the critical economic nexus of the entire Nigerian territory. The Niger Delta people will speak, shortly, after full consultations, on this callous act, on the best legal and political response\u201d.\n\nBut in his own reaction, President, National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators (NCNDE-A) General Eshanekpe Isreal, Aka Akpodoro, commended President Buhari for having the political will to sign the bill into law after over a decade of its politicization on the floor of the National Assembly.\n\nHe urged the stakeholders in the oil bearing communities across the states to ensure that the allocation from the 3percent conceded to them in the PIA is properly utilized for the purpose of both human and infrastructural development so as to positively impact the lives of the people. He appealed to state government, National Assembly members as well as their counterparts in the state assemblies to liaise with various host communities constituted authorities saddled with the responsibility of disbursing the funds to effectively use the money to better the lots of their people.",

          "title": "You want to get a visa? These simple steps might lead to success",
          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nAttending a visa interview is usually laced with anxiety, especially for first time applicants. However, this anxiety could be doused if some simple tips are adhered to. A visa denial could be emotionally troubling, especially when the applicant is due to attend an urgent business meeting, funeral of a loved one, graduation or wedding ceremony of one\u2019s offspring, among others. Ideally, there are no fast rules to getting a visa, other than the applicant getting himself/herself acquainted with the basic requirements of the country they intend to visit.\n\nOften times, applicants apply the generic rule in either preparing for interview or presenting their documents. This is a major blunder, as each country has its own set of distinct immigration rules, which if not adhered to at the point of filling an application form, automatically reduces the chances of getting a visa. One major mistake that applicants should be wary of is applying for or paying for the wrong category of visa. There are various categories of visas ranging from; immigrant to non-immigrant visa, work visa, study visa, exchange visitor visa, business/conference visa, and the B1/B2 (visitor visa).\n\nOthers are; I visa (Journalist and Media), religious worker visa, transit/ship crew visa, domestic employee visa. For the United States, the most common and popular of its entire visa category is the B1/B2. The B-1/B-2- visitor visa is for people travelling to the United States temporarily for business (B-1), for pleasure or for medical treatment (B-2). Generally, the B-1 visa is for travellers consulting with business associates, attending scientific, educational, professional or business conventions/conferences, settling an estate or negotiating contracts. The B-2 visa is for travel that is recreational in nature, including tourism, visits with friends or relatives, medical treatment and activities of a fraternal, social or service nature. Often, the B-1 and B-2 visas are combined and issued as one visa: the B-1/B-2.\n\nWhile most countries in the European Union territory/Schengen, Canada, South Africa among others do not require applicants to be physically present for a visa interview, the United States of America (USA) does. Responding to Saturday Sun inquiry, Mrs. Aderonke Adenrele Fatomi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Voxron Travels, a firm that specialises in visa and travel advisory services, said research has proven that poor documentation and incorrect information by applicants remained reasons for the upsurge in visa denials. She added that one needs not be a millionaire to secure a visa, contrary to misconceptions making the rounds, adding than an applicant\u2019s statement of account must run in a logical manner; meaning that inflow and outflow on such accounts must be in good standing. She further explained that applicants should avoid the lodgement of bulk funds that cannot be defended into an account, warning that such transaction could raise a red flag\n\nBelow are a few tips that could guide applicants in the process leading to their visa interview or preparing their application documents. This list is not exhaustive as applicants are equally expected to carry out further research in order to be successful.\n\nOne: Avoid forged documents\n\nEither you are attending an interview in person or submitting your documents at a visa application centre, avoid the presentation of forged documents. Submission of forged documents has been on the rise lately and all embassies/consulate frown at such development.\n\nThe use of forged/cloned documents could lead to a visa ban of up to 10 years or more, depending on the decision of the consular.\n\nTwo: Say it as it is\n\nDo not try to impress the consular in anyway because majority of them are experienced, having served in various countries and could easily tell when an applicant is trying to impress them, leading to telling lies. If you do not have answer to a question, simply say so, instead of making inaccurate guesses and outright lies that put you on the spotlight.\n\nTelling lies either in your application or during a live interview session will only reduce your chances of getting the live. Most consulars prefer you tell them the truth even if you as the applicant consider your chances slim.\n\nThree: Get your documents right\n\nLike it was pointed out earlier, there are no fast rules to visa application process, as the documents from one country to another differ. However, there are basic documents that cut across. Pay the right application fee in relation to the visa class/category you are applying for. Fill the right application form. Schedule a visa appointment where necessary and get the right specification of the passport photograph.\n\nUsing a poor quality photograph with the wrong dimension could put your application at risk. Ensure the validity of your travel passport is at least six months. Also include the evidence of your visa application fee in your application package. For all visa classes, include in your documents or go to the interview with all relevant certificates from high school to university level, marriage certificate, family photographs, pay slips, ID card, letter of employment/ last promotion, bank statement, among others.\n\nFour: Steer clear of fraudulent agents\n\nThe quest for economic migration has led to an upswing in the cases of visa fraud. A majority of unsuspecting applicants have fallen prey to the fraudulent activities of some agents who parade false claims, thereby duping unsuspecting members of the public.\n\nThe requirements for a visa application are clear and can be obtained from the website of the various embassies and consulates. The use of an agent does not automatically guarantee the issuance of a visa because it has been discovered that in some cases, the applicants are even more knowledgeable than the so called agents. For the United States, information relating to the various visa categories could be viewed via; www.ustraveldocs.com while that of the United Kingdom could be seen via;www.gov.uk\n\nFive: Consular expectation\n\nThe applicant must be able to prove to the consular/interviewing officer that the purpose of the trip is what is stated in the application. He/she must equally convince the officer that there is a strong tie that would compel him to return to his country at the expiration of such trip. Often times, most applicants fail to demonstrate this, leading to a visa denial. For instance, a denial under section 214(b) of the U.S immigration and Nationality Act means that an applicant is not able to demonstrate that the intended activities in the U.S would be consistent with the classification of the non immigrant visa for which they applied.\n\nSix: Don\u2019t be late\n\nThe embassy or consulate will tell you the exact date and time of your interview. If you get there late or unprepared, you will leave the official with a negative impression of you, and that might ultimately hurt your visa application.\n\nIndeed, tardiness on the interview day creates a negative impression of the applicant in the mind of the official. Instead, try to arrive at the embassy or consulate where your interview will take place at least a few minutes earlier.\n\nThis will help you calm yourself down and relax when giving your answers to the interview questions. Also, make sure to leave home early enough, counting the traffic jam. The embassy or consulate will tell you the exact date and time of your interview. If you\u2019re late, in some cases, you may have to reschedule the appointment and pay a fresh application fee.\n\nSeven: Don\u2019t give out unnecessary information\n\nIf you have been asked a question, make sure to understand it well. Exaggerated answers and not required explanations are not supposed to be given at visa interviews. The visa official is not interested in losing a day hearing everything about you \u2013 unneeded and irrelevant information. The official only wants to get specific and clear information that he directly asks you.\n\nAvoid losing a sense of your talk, by trying to impress the visa official with too much of the talk. In its place, keep your answer short, simple and assessable, by holding the regular flow of the interview. Remember that the interview should be natural and with no need for imposing moments.\n\nEight: Keep nervousness away\n\nWhat destroys your answers during the interview, is appearing there full of nervousness. Even though your visa application and supporting documents as well as your physical appearance are as they should, a bad energy, nervousness, over-confidence might destroy your interview. Speaking too much of your successes, shaky noise, pointing yourself or the official with a finger, unstable eye contact and other negative gesticulations because of the anxiety you experience in the interview can cause the official to end it fast.\n\nTo avoid such an uninvited situation, it is suggested you relax and calm your nerves early enough before the interview. Try to not overstate the interview concern, instead, consider it an approachable meeting.\n\nNine: Avoid disagreeing with the visa official\n\nArguing with the visa official during the interview session is another reason the entire visa interview session might go wrong. An increased tone of voice or a bad approach towards the visa official only shows you are a destructive individual that does not have respect for the authority that the representative of the diplomatic office enjoys. In its place, in case you have any objection about what the official says, use a very sophisticated language and a calm tone of voice when clarifying the exploratory issue.",

          "text": "*Says governors will exhaust all options before going to court\n\n*Pledges to work with PIA implementation committee\n\n*Presidency says concerns to be addressed through amendment\n\n*Sylva: Upstream regulator, not NNPC will handle proceeds from Federation Crude\n\n*Says only political N\u2019Delta complaining about 3% host communities\u2019 fund\n\n*Act has shortchanged Cross River, Ayade cries out\n\nBy Kingsley Nwezeh, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja; Nume Ekeghe in Lagos and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nChairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, yesterday, reiterated the state governors\u2019 concerns about the 30 per cent allocation for frontier exploration and the three per cent for host communities as contained in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). Fayemi said those provisions in the law assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16 greatly depleted the Federation Account.\n\nFayemi spoke in an interview with the Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY.\n\nThe NGF chairman, who is also the governor of Ekiti State, said the governors were not carried along in the enactment of the law. But he pledged that the state chief executives would cooperate with the PIA implementation committee headed by Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nFayemi said court action would be the governors\u2019 last resort in trying to address their concerns over the PIA.\n\nHowever, the federal government yesterday clarified that the proposed Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC), not the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, will handle proceeds from the sale of crude oil accruing to the three tiers of government when the PIA becomes fully operational.\n\nFayemi said the forum believed the provisions of the 1999 Constitution should be adhered to with regard to concerns raised by the governors, including ownership structure, accountability, and transparency.\n\nHe criticised the federal government\u2019s handling of repatriated loots, saying the management of such funds is not the exclusive preserve of the federal government since the monies ought to be part of the federation account originally.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cThis is a matter that the entire forum has discussed extensively, and we have come to certain conclusions about what is called frontier funds. Whether it is three per cent or not, our concern there is that whatever you are taking into these places is a depletion of the federation account, that money will not go to the federation account, it would be spread across the few areas that you described as volunteer basis, rather than to the entire federation.\n\n\u201cAnd we worry more about the entire federation not about selected parts of the federation. For us as governors, that is a distinction without a difference. We are talking about depletion from the federation account, whether it is three per cent or 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is money that should come to federation account, that should then be subjected to fair and equitable distribution on principles of sharing, rather than one that is going to be at the whims and caprices of this new limited company.\u201d\n\nThe Ekiti State governor said the forum would explore all available options before seeking legal interpretation. He said the Minister of Petroleum Resources had reached out to the forum to say that their concerns would be addressed as an amendment to the new petroleum law.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is not everything that we have to resort to court to resolve. We only do that when all options have been exhausted and we haven\u2019t secured a reprieve.\n\n\u201cOn this particular instance, we will work with the implementation committee. And if there is any reason for us to take an alternative measure, we will cross that bridge when we get to that. But at least it has been acknowledged that these issues can be resolved, in some way, shape or form, as we are proposing. We will wait and see before we take any further steps.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fayemi commended the president for signing the Act. He maintained that the constitutional issues the NGF raised before the bill was passed into law were not addressed.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, we have commended these major developments in our country because it is something that has been on the cards for us.\n\n\u201cSo, kudos to the president for finally working with the National Assembly to get the PIA in place.\n\n\u201cHowever, we also believe that whatever we are doing should be done in accordance with the constitution so that we do not have to blame ourselves.\n\n\u201cThe issues that governors are concerned about, and which we made clear to the National Assembly when this bill was in the process of becoming an Act, relate to ownership structure and questions of accountability and transparency so that at the end of the day, we don\u2019t subvert the original intention behind the petroleum industries act.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of repatriated loots domiciled with the federal government, Fayemi said, \u201cWe believe that our president is a stickler to the rule of law and due process and sometimes he doesn\u2019t get a comprehensive advice from those who are the technical people in charge of some of these issues.\n\n\u201cWhen the matter around recovered loots came up, we communicated with the Attorney General of the Federation and raised our concerns about the source of the money that was allegedly looted anyway, which in our view, was from the federation account. It wasn\u2019t federal government money.\n\n\u201cSo when you want to return the loots, you cannot just say you are returning to the federal government and the federal government decides to do whatever it chooses to do with it. We would have preferred a situation in which the funds are returned to the federation account.\n\n\u201cWhatever the government chooses to do with it, there are mechanisms in government that would allow governors to also partake in that discussion. That is why we have the National Economic Council, where we are members and the Vice President is the chair, where we take collective decisions on issues that are germane to both the federal and sub-nationals, and that\u2019s all we were pleading for. It wasn\u2019t a case of being averse to whatever the government has chosen to do with the recovered loot, what we felt is, you cannot take a decision without our input as critical actors in the federation.\u201d\n\nFG: Upstream Regulator, Not NNPC, Will Handle Proceeds from Federation Crude\n\nThe federal government has said the proposed NURC, not NNPC Limited, will handle proceeds from the sale of crude oil accruing to the three tiers of government when the PIA becomes fully operational. Briefing journalists after the inauguration of the steering committee as well as the implementation working group of the PIA, Sylva said being a Companies and Allied Matters (CAMA) entity, NNPC Limited may no longer be in a position to function in that role.\n\nThe minister said although the upstream regulator might not be directly involved in lifting federation crude oil, all the monies accruing from sales of the commodity would be handled by the commission, while NNPC would only get a percentage for carrying out the lifting.\n\nHowever, the minister added that the committee, which he inaugurated, would thrash out areas of disagreement.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cThe next question is whether the commission, as a regulatory agency, can be involved in commercial activities? Yes, when I gave that answer yesterday, I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to say everything.\n\n\u201cThe other question should be whether NNPC, as a commercial body, registered under CAMA, can be in charge of federation crude? We have to find a way out of this. That crude belongs to the federation of Nigeria and when it is sold, it has to go to the federation account.\n\n\u201cSo, the commission is not necessarily going to sell the crude, but will handle the crude. If NNPC sells the crude on a commercial basis, the revenues accruing from the sales of the crude will now go through the commission to the federation account and NNPC will charge commission for that role.\n\n\u201cAs a commercial activity, it will just sell and it is doing that as a commercial entity and the fund will be moved into the federation account. Those are all part of the issues that we will be discussing at the implementation level so that we have a seamless way of doing things.\u201d\n\nSylva also spoke on the ownership structure of the proposed NNPC Limited, which the governors had alleged did not incorporate the states and local governments. He said, like other entities, the federal government would hold the equity in trust for all the other tiers of government.\n\nBut he revealed that negotiation was on with the state governors on the issues.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe other issue is the ownership of the NNPC, which has been raised variously by governors and we have also responded. I think we are having an understanding, that is all I can say. I do not want to pre-empt that discussion. But, we are having an understanding. In this country there is the federal government of Nigeria and then there is the federation.\n\n\u201cThe federal government of Nigeria can always hold something in trust for the federation. I can assure you that we are already discussing, and we are clarifying some of these issues. In this case, what the federal government is doing is to hold this equity in trust for the federation.\u201d\n\nThe minister stated that this was not the first time that would be happening, explaining that the federal government is currently holding the equity in LNG Bonny in trust for the federation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIf the federal government holds the equity in trust for the federation, it means it is holding it in trust for the states, for the local governments and by extension, also the communities.\n\n\u201cWe are one country, everything flows out from this country, let\u2019s not make it look like we are not one country. The federal government of Nigeria is the preeminent government among the tiers, the levels of government.\n\n\u201cSo now, the federal government of Nigeria is in a position to hold equity in trust for the rest of Nigerians. And this is what we are doing in this case, and this is what federal government has also done in other cases.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said while Nigeria was interested in more foreign investments, its focus now was on the IOCs in the country, stressing that a lot of projects on the verge of crystallising would now be fast-tracked since the new legislation has been signed.\n\nHe disclosed that a number of investors had reached out to the ministry post-PIA, maintaining that the oil companies, which the federal government has had a long relationship with, would be the first priority.\n\nSylva noted that while a number of IOCs had indicated interest in divesting their onshore assets, there were still a lot of prospects offshore, including the ultra-deep offshore, beyond the current 2,000 metres.\n\nHe explained that even oil companies that were thinking of leaving onshore operations were still showing interest in the offshore of Nigeria as well as the ultra-deep offshore, which is still in frontier territory.\n\nAnswering a question on the alleged skewedness of the steering committee in terms of gender and ethnicity, he stated that members were supposed to represent their offices and not necessarily ethnic groups or a particular gender. But, he said those are some of the issues the PIA would correct.\n\nOn possible unrest in the Niger Delta due to the grouse over the three per cent allocated to the oil producing areas, he said the region had no reason to react badly, saying those that have been very vocal from the area were simply politicising the issues.\n\nSylva said, \u201cI see a lot of politics, a lot of politicking, but I have not really seen very senior Niger Delta people that we all respect, that are apolitical, speak against this. If you look at it very well, you cannot really say it is only three per cent. This per cent is on top of so many other things.\u201d\n\nHe listed them as the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), the 13 per cent derivation and others, which he said amounted to a lot of money. But he noted that there were still issues surrounding the implementation of the funds accruing to the region.\n\nAccording to the former governor of Bayesa State, \u201cI can assure you that well-meaning Niger Deltans are not against this. It is the political Niger Delta that is speaking. And if the political Niger Delta is speaking, I am a part of that political Niger Delta and I will not want to join issues with them yet.\u201d\n\nSylva stated that there was no role for the government in the administration of the community funds, stressing that it is different from the Frontier Basins Fund, which is an investment in getting more oil off the ground, and not targeted at the communities.\n\nEarlier while inaugurating the committees, the minister said the crystallisation of the 20-year petroleum industry reform journey called for accolades and celebration.\n\nHe said there should a deliberate effort by all and sundry to ensure successful implementation of the PIA in order to get the desired result.\n\nMembers of the PIA committee include Sylva, who\u2019s the chairman; Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr. Sani Gwarzo; Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari; Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Muhammad Nami; and Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources, Dr. Nuhu Habib.\n\nIn the group also are a representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget And National Planning, representative of the Ministry of Justice, External Legal Adviser, Olufemi Lijadu, and Executive Secretary, PTDF and Head of the Implementation Working Group/Coordinating Secretariat Dr. Bello Gusau.\n\nAct Has Short-changed Cross River, Ayade Cries Out\n\nGovernor of Cross River State, Professor Ben Ayade, said the new law perpetuated injustice against his state. Ayade was quoted as saying this while receiving in audience some members of the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), led by the state\u2019s representative, Ntufam Eyo Nsa Whiley.\n\nWhiley said they were in the state to sensitise the government and the people on the forthcoming stakeholders meeting with the leadership of the commission to collate views on the review of the current revenue formula.\n\nAyade expressed scepticism about the new attempt to review the revenue formula, saying it may not herald anything positive for the state.\n\nRecalling how the Senate Committee on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that toured the state failed to mirror the grievances of Cross River in the bill before it was finally signed into law, the governor said the experience was enough \u201cfor us to express our deep and sincere distrust in the entire exercise and processes of RMAFC\u201d.\n\nA statement from the governor\u2019s office quoted him as saying, \u201cAs I spoke to the Senate Committee on PIB then, I will choose same to communicate the position of Cross River State, which is that we do not have faith in this exercise, neither do we believe that it will end properly.\u201d\n\nWith particular reference to the PIB, Ayade said, \u201cAs far as we are concerned as a state, we have been reduced to want in body in spirit and in soul,\u201d adding, \u201cThere is no indication whatsoever that the review of the revenue allocation will be based on the principle of jurisprudence, equity and fair play.\u201d\n\nHe recalled, \u201cWhen the PIB committee visited, I took my time and articulated in the best of professional grammar to explain to them that producing communities are not as delicate and sensitive as impacted communities. Cross River State bears the brunt of production, but today the PIB is signed into law, insensitive to the oil impacted communities to which Cross River State belongs.\n\n\u201cIn the same PIB, 30 per cent of revenue is set aside for frontier exploration, luckily the Calabar basin, which they refused to recognise in that category which stretches from all the mountain basins, cutting across the whole of Bakassi, Biase Odukpani, Okuni, Ogoja, Yala, is heavily impregnated with hydrocarbon. The geo-coordinates have been issued by myself since 2016 to the federal government. Today, we watch and see how the 30 per cent set aside for the frontier exploration will be managed. And we will see what will happen to the Calabar basin.\u201d\n\nAyade queried a scenario, \u201cwhere Edo, Delta, Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom states; and Cameroon all have oil and Cross River will not have oil? And you sit on this injustice and it goes on year after year after year?\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cThe principle under which RMAFC is set out and the way they are operating so far is inconsistent with the provisions of the law that established it. I would like to have this on record that you have failed to use your mandate judiciously. You have failed to understand that the law empowers you to review the formula not based on obnoxious principles.\u201d\n\nThe governor charged RMAFC to do what is fair, just and right, saying, \u201dEven as we come to articulate our position, if the majority of the people who are satisfied with the present situation carry the day, we would have spoken in futility and in vain.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the law has taken all our rights and vested them on RMAFC, so no matter how we shout and scream, the buck stops on your table. Even the stabilisation funds that are now being shared among all the states, that was not the spirit and intent of the stabilisation funds. The basis for everything that the constitution had envisaged to balance the financially disadvantaged states is being taken off and that is the role of RMAFC.\u201d\n\nThe committee, which has a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Barr Efefiom Ekong as chairman, has as members, His Royal Majesty Etim Okon Edet, chairman, Traditional Rulers Council, Chief Gersh Henshaw, Professor Mike Okom, Stella Odey-Ekpo, Pastor John Ewa, Comrade Ben Ukpepi, Dan Obo, Betty, representative of the market women, among others.\n\nIjaw Youth Declare Buhari, Sylva \u2018Unwelcomed\u2019 to Niger Delta\n\nAnger over the PIA in the Niger Delta deepened yesterday with Ijaw youths from the six states of the region declaring that Buhari and Sylva are no longer welcomed in the region over their roles in the making of the new petroleum law.\n\nThe Ijaw youths, under the aegis of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) worldwide, had on Tuesday rejected the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) that was enacted on Monday, saying it is an affront to the people of the region who had risen against the three per cent provision for the oil producing communities.\n\nIYC spokesman, Mr. Ebilade Ekerefe, in a statement issued in Yenagoa, said the decision not to welcome Buhari and Sylva to the region was a further show of their rejection of the law.\n\nEkerefe insisted that Buhari should have sent the bill back to the National Assembly for upward review of the three per cent equity share to host communities whose environments had suffered decades of degradation through oil exploration activities.\n\nHe said a substantial percentage to the host communities would have helped to address this age long cruelty to Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cUntil that is done, there is nothing to celebrate,\u201d Ekerefe stated.\n\nOn the explanation offered by Sylva on the three per cent, Ekerefe described the minister\u2019s comment as an afterthought. He said what the minister should have done was to apologise and appeal \u201cto the consciences of our people, rather than justifying an act which is politically tailored to favour the north and its allies in the industry.\u201d\n\nEkerefe stated that it was \u201ca rape to justice and equity for the National Assembly to pass three per cent equity share to the host communities, while passing 30 per cent to frontier basins which in our view is grossly inadequate and it is against the unanimous 10 per cent agreement by stakeholders for host communities when the National Assembly visited the region.\n\n\u201cWith the amount of speed the president used in signing the PIB without recourse to the stem stand by stakeholders from the region, the president has further demonstrated that the opinions of the Niger Delta people don\u2019t matter in his government as we\u2019ve witnessed in other areas that require urgent attention of his government.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the forgoing, there\u2019s no better time for the people of the Niger Delta region to intensify the struggle for resource control and self-determination. We believe strongly that that will be the only sure path upon which our God given natural resources can be managed by us, and not this impunity we\u2019ve witnessed from a repressive federal government under President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu\n\nClerk to the National Assembly, Ojo Olatunde Amos, Thursday disclosed that late former President Shehu Shagari prevented members of the Second Republic National Assembly from making themselves members of the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC).\n\nAmos made this known while playing host to a delegation of the Committee on Administration and Human Resources of Ghana Parliamentary Service Board at the National Assembly.\n\nHe said when the idea was mooted by then Senate Leader, late Senator Olusola Saraki, Shagari turned it down by asking the then serving Senators and members of the House of Representatives to choose whether to be members of the commission and forfeit their legislative seats or remain as serving lawmakers.\n\nThe Clerk explained how parliamentary bureaucracy was treated like an appendage of the Executive arm of government until year 2000 when the National Assembly Service Commission was created.\n\nHe said: \u201cBetween 1979 and 1985, politicians tended to act in the military fashion rather than exhibiting democratic traits. For instance, in 1981 when the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria initiated a bill for an Act to establish the National Assembly Service Commission, the then Senate leader, Sen. Olusola Saraki, was said to have proposed that membership of the Commission be composed of Senators and members of the House of Representatives serving at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen the proposal got to President Shehu Shagari, he asked the Members of the National Assembly to choose between being members of the National Assembly and members of the National Assembly Service Commission. However the Legislative proposal for the commission\u2019s establishment did not see the light of the day during the Shagari administration, perhaps due to the sudden military takeover of power in December 1983.\n\n\u201c1983 the National Assembly was again suspended until 1993 when General Ibrahim Babangida ousted Buhari. Before then, General Ibrahim Babangida had in 1988 through decree 48 of 1988 directed the creation of departments in various ministries of government and National Assembly was created as a department in the presidency. What this implies is that until the return of democracy in 1999 and the creation of the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) in 2000, National Assembly bureaucracy was not totally independent of the Executive arm.\u201d\n\nHe assured the Ghanaian delegation led by Hon Johnson Asiedu Nketiah that processes and procedures guiding the Nigerian model of independent Parliament and its bureaucracy, will be available to them.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "National Assembly members are bracing for a face-off with their principal officers after finding out they had been grossly cheated in the sharing of a multimillion-dollar bribe to ensure the passage of the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nThree senators and two House members confirmed to The Peoples Gazette following an initial tip-off that least $10 million was paid in cash to the federal lawmakers to help accelerate the passage of the bill despite pervasive opposition to a clause that granted only three percent of upstream oil companies\u2019 operating income to host communities.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, Senate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nSpecifically, the newspaper reported that the lawmakers are fuming over what one of them termed as \u201cgreedy misconduct\u201d of Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamiala, who were accused of taking $2 million each in cash bribes to push the bill through despite protests from host communities.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported earlier today (Friday) that the chief pricinpal lawmaker in the Upper Chamber, Lawan and his counterpart in the Lower Chamber, Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to guarantee the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSee Also Corruption EXPOSED: Dollar Bribes Received By Nigeria's Senate President, Lawan, House Speaker Gbajabiamila, Other Lawmakers To Pass Controversial Petroleum Bill\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that other federal lawmakers \u2013senators and House of Representatives' members \u2013also received bribes in dollars to ensure the passage of the bill.\n\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\n\nThe payment of the monies was said to have been facilitated by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\n\"Each senator was paid $20, 000 (N8.2 million) while members of the lower chamber (House of Representatives) were paid $5, 000 (N2 million) each,\" the source added.\n\nHowever, the newspaper revealed that a Nigerian billionaire, probably of the largest contemporary stake in the oil and gas industry was said to have provided $2 million alone.\n\nOther firms and individuals in the oil and gas industry provided the remaining $8 million. The Gazette could not publicly identify the Billionaire.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President received $2 million and the Speaker received $2 million. Their greedy misconduct was recently exposed to us and we will seriously take up the matter when we resume from the annual recess next month,\u201d a senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid charges of breach of privilege, said.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can volunteer, many senators were given $20,000 before and after the PIB was passed, depending on their availability,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker furious about the affair admitted to The Gazette that he received $5,000, but said he didn\u2019t know it was part of a multimillion-dollar payout to lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cThey gave me $5,000 and said it was for us to buy biscuits for our children for labouring day and night to get the bill to the stage of passage,\u201d the lawmaker said under anonymity. \u201cTo God, I did not know that it was about $10 million that they received and some crooks calling themselves leaders got $2 million each for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe will protest the matter after our break because some people have to realise that they don\u2019t have two heads and we have to fight for our rights and privileges as members of the National Assembly,\u201d the lawmaker added. \u201cEach one of us is representing a constituency and that makes us all equal because no one at the National Assembly is representing more than one constituency.\u201d\n\nHost communities, largely of the oil-rich Niger-Delta region, had criticised that 3% is inadequate to address decaded of environmental degradation and neglect inflicted on traditional settlers. The communities said they would accept at least 10 per cent, even though the administration initially proposed five per cent.\n\nBut the state-operated Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and other operators dug their heels in, saying any sharing formular that offers more than 3% to host communities will cut too deep into their revenue margins and drive away potential investors in the country\u2019s wobbling oil sector.\n\nNotwitthsatnding the standoff at rowdy and inconclusive sessions at the Chambers, lawmakers last month finally passed the Petroleum Industry Bill that sought to repackage the sector and restructure the NNPC as a commercial enterprise rather than a federal charter. Buhari signed the bill into law this week despite the controversies surrounding the meagre three per cent equity stake for host communities.\n\nIt was learnt that lawmakers accepted cash inducements to pass the bill, which was proposed by Buhari\u2019s government. Lawmakers said the cash logistics was coordinated by state petroleum minister Timipre Sylva and Senator Albert Akpan (PDP-Akwa Ibom).\n\nA senator revealed to The Gazette that Mr Akpan sent one of his aides to deliver $20,000 to him at his office.\n\n\u201cHe (Mr Akpan) sent a woman from his office to give me $20,000. They said the money came from people who have investments in the oil and gas and they wanted to appreciate us for our dedication in seeing the bill through after so many years of failed efforts,\u201d the senator said.\n\nAnother lawmaker who confirmed the bribery said it was a serious scandal waiting to explode because a lawmaker had already mentioned the matter in the House' WhatsApp group weeks ago.\n\n\u201cA lawmaker protested the sharing formula but no one responded or engaged him in the House' WhatsApp group,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cSo I fear that many colleagues are angry about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nA lawmaker said the unrest could easily have been avoided had the leaders properly conducted themselves in handling the largesse.\n\n\u201cIt is common across the world for lawmakers to be offered gratification,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cBut it has to be equitably distributed so that no one feels cheated or left out.\u201d",

          "summary": "Nigeria's Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to ensure the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\nThe Nigerian Senate recently passed the Petroleum Industry Bill approving 3 per cent for host communities despite calls from various quarters that the provisions made for host communities should be reviewed upward.\nTheir president, Benjamin Tamanarebi said the PIB passed by NASS was a fruitless exercise and unacceptable to the host communities.\nIn their July 5 meeting, governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states also rejected the proposed three per cent share to host communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill.",

However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year, the Nigerian tech industry has been the recipient of seemingly damaging policies, from the crypto ban to NIPOST\u2019s reversed regulations to the Lagos okada ban.\n\nA few days ago, rumours of an intended amendment to the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007 circulated on social media.\n\nIt finally gained traction when a link to the leaked bill was released, and several screenshots of supposedly alarming provisions began to float all over social media.\n\nWhat is in the leaked bill, and how different is it from the subsisting Act? Does NITDA have new powers? Who does this affect? We took a fine-tooth comb through its hairs and found some surprising information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is NITDA?\n\nNITDA is the agency tasked with creating a framework for the planning, research, development, standardisation, application, coordination, monitoring, evaluation and regulation of Information Technology practices in Nigeria.\n\nThe Agency is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Digital Economy. As part of its mandate, it provides regulations regarding data protection, registration of domination names, IT Clearance, among others.\n\nWhat powers does NITDA have?\n\nUnder the current Act, the Agency itself has no powers. On the other hand, NITDA\u2019s Board is clothed with five powers, none containing any hint of these new powers.\n\nWhat the Agency does have is a host of functions which increase from 14 to 24 in the leaked bill.\n\nIf this proposed bill is anything to go by, NITDA appears to be gearing up for a more active, albeit forceful reign.\n\nHas the bill been passed?\n\nNo, it has not. The National Assembly (NASS) has not received the bill as of yet.\n\nHowever, In March 2021, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Agency\u2019s DG, \u201cpresented a proposal for the realignment of \u2018NITDA Act 2007\u2019 with the tenets and ideals of Digital Economy Policy of the current administration, and indeed, the 4th Industrial Revolution before the relevant committees of both chambers of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nWho leaked the NITDA bill?\n\nThere is currently no accurate information as to who leaked the bill. It began circulating on social media, and conversations sprung up in dismay, anger, and disappointment. So far, attention has been paid to the provisions in Sections 6, 13, 20, and 27 as they seem to question the importance of ease of doing business to the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index 2020 \u2014 measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments.\n\nWhat does the new bill contain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first glance at the leaked bill reveals several new sections, one of which \u2014 Section 6 \u2014is proposing new powers be given to the Agency.\n\nAmong these worrying provisions is a new subsection which gives the Agency the power to \u201center premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nNITDA will also have the power to \u201cfix licencing and authorisation charges, collect fees and penalties as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions under this Act.\u201d\n\nThis bill would also introduce a new regime of licences and penalties.\n\nSection 20 would give NITDA power to issue regulations regarding licences and authorisations for operators in the information technology and digital economy sector \u2014 which the Agency is to determine.\n\nThese licences are classified into three categories: Product Licence, Service Provider Licence, and Platform Provider Licence.\n\nWith the number of licence regimes which Nigerian startups currently have to subscribe to, is there a possibility that there would be duplicity?\n\nAway from licences, we come to penalties.\n\nWhat are these penalties, and who do they affect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from\n\nIf the leaked bill is to be believed, Section 13 says individuals found guilty of failing to comply with NITDA\u2019s rules would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) or face one-year imprisonment, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, corporate bodies, if found guilty, would be liable to a fine of not less than \u20a630 million ($72,832.21). The \u2018principal officers\u2019 of the companies might also be imprisoned for two years or more.\n\nReferencing its proposed search powers, individuals or corporations that contravene the provision would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) and \u20a630 million ($72,832.21), respectively. Prison terms range from a year to two for individuals and members within a corporate body.\n\nSurprisingly, there seems to be an error on offences with no penalties under the Act. In a preceding subsection, the leaked bill proposes a fine not exceeding \u20a630,000,000 ($72,832.21).\n\nOn the same subject, in a directly succeeding paragraph, it then provides for fines not exceeding \u20a63,000,000 ($7,283.82) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,138.87) for first and subsequent offenders, respectively.\n\nWhat else is different in this bill?\n\nA good starting point is the penalties placed on offences. Under the current Act, first-time offenders are liable to at least one year imprisonment or a fine of \u20a6200,000 ($485.55), or both.\n\nFor subsequent offenders they are liable to at least two years imprisonment, a fine of \u20a6500,000 ($1,213.89), or both.\n\nThe leaked bill suggests an expansion of these penalties and no longer requires NITDA to collaborate with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to enforce its regulations.\n\nOther new provisions include a broadened section on the functions of the Minister of Information and Digital Economy, new sections on administrative redress processes, rulemaking processes, and the establishment of a Digital Infrastructure and Service Provision Company \u2014 Galaxy Backbone\n\nWhat is Galaxy Backbone?\n\nA look at the provision regarding the establishment of Galaxy Backbone reveals an interesting angle. One of the members of the Board is to be a representative of the Jigawa State Government.\n\nA look at Galaxy Backbone\u2019s website reveals no connection to the Jigawa State Government. It is an information technology and shared service provider wholly owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nAfter a more in-depth search, the name Galaxy Information Technology and Telecommunication (GITT) cropped up. The company, which provides a wide range of communication services, was founded by Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, former Governor of Jigawa State, in 2001.\n\nWhile the names are somewhat similar, there is seemingly no connection between the two companies.\n\nHowever, several tweets by different Twitter users suggest a relationship between the two companies.\n\nGalaxy Information Technology and Telecommunications Limited started as a Dutse-based ISP in 2001 and morphed into what is now Galaxy Backbone. The Federal Government and Jigawa State Government co-owned 51% while private stakeholders held 49%.\n\n\n\n*waltzes back to vacation mode* \u2014 'Gb\u00e9nga \u1e62\u1eb9\u0300san (@gbengasesan) August 16, 2021\n\nTech-wise, Jigawa state was ahead of its time. As far back as the early 2000s, Dutse, Hadejia and parts of Kazaure had metro Wifi.\n\n\n\nThey setup Galaxy Backbone, which OBJ was so impressed with that he told them they HAD to sell it to the FG (and in return, FG will host and use\u2026 \u2014 SuperSanusi (@supersanusi) August 17, 2021\n\nWhat is the National Information Technology Development Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Image: Current Act, 2nd Image: Leaked Bill\n\nA major sticking point has been the NITDA fund as contained in the leaked bill.\n\nThe fund is to be financed in four specific ways. The first is a levy of 1% of the profit before tax of companies and enterprises contained in the Third Schedule of the bill with an annual turnover of \u20a6100,000,000 ($242,777.37) and above, which is tax-deductible.\n\nOther avenues include gifts, endowments, and grants-in-aid.\n\nIntriguingly, this is unchanged from the current Act. Several questions arise. Is NITDA implementing it currently? Are there issues with the current execution strategy? How does it plan to implement this?\n\nThe expanded powers of the Agency in Section 6 and the provision of penalties \u2014 not currently contained in the NITDA Act \u2014 suggest an answer.\n\nOther provisions such as the need for a pre-action notice, tax exemptions, and limitations to suits, uses of the fund remain unchanged\n\nWhich companies will pay the levy?\n\nUnder the current Act, the companies are:\n\nGSM Service Providers and all Telecommunications companies;\n\nCyber Companies and Internet Provider;\n\nPensions Managers and pension-related companies\n\nBanks and other Financial Institution\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nAs contained in the leaked bill, these companies are\n\nmobile and fixed telecommunications companies,\n\ninformation technology, e-commerce companies,\n\ndigital platform operators and providers,\n\nforeign digital platforms targeting the Nigerian market,\n\npensions managers and pension-related companies,\n\nbanks, financial institutions and companies providing financial services using information technology tools,\n\ninsurance companies, and\n\nsuch other companies and enterprises as determined by regulations from time to time by the Agency.\n\nEssentially, startups or companies in the above list will be affected if this bill is passed into law.\n\nThe way forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese draconian rules, if this exact bill is eventually submitted and passed into law by the National Assembly, could spell hard times for the Nigerian startup scene.\n\nThis is coming at a time when the Nigerian Startup Bill \u2014 a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the Presidency to harness the potential of the digital economy through co-created regulations \u2014 is being prepared to be placed before NASS.\n\nAs contained on the website, \u201cThe Bill will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s laws and regulations are friendly, clear, planned and work for the tech ecosystem. This, we believe, will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for growth, attraction and protection of investment in tech startups.\u201d\n\nIs there a possibility that the Nigerian Startup Bill might be declared dead on arrival if the leaked NITDA bill is published?\n\nIn July 2021, Flutterwave announced the appointment of a Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. Chances are, we may see this trend continue, with startups and companies taking pre-emptive steps to engage the government.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, Shalom Jare Ventures Limited wrote petitions to the Edo State Government, Inspector-General of Police in Abuja and Commissioner of Police in Edo over alleged land grabbing, malicious damage and robbery by suspected banditry squad of Ovbokhan Igbinovia, the Ohen of Okhuoromi Village, demanding for investigation and prosecution of the alleged culprits. The petitions which dated 17th August, 2021; May 27th, 2021 and May 17th, 2021 and signed by Efosa Aguebor (Operation Manager, Shalom Jare) and O.A Otamere Esq, Counsel to the claimants respectively, were titled \u201cReport of Land grabbing, malicious damage and robbery by banditry squad of Ovbokhan Igbinovia, the Ohen of Okhuoromi: Request for investigation and prosecution of culprits; Re: Bandits in our clients farmland in Edo State: Request for urgent arrest of leaders of the group and Complaints of threat of violence, malicious damage to property, assault/harassment of farmers and malicious damage to palm crops: Request to invite culprits for interrogation and removal of caravan placed on the frontage of the plot of Shalom Jare Ventures Ltd\u201d The company claimed that the alleged actions of Okhuoromi has violated the Enrolment Of Order Motion Exparte in Suit No. B/407/18, dated 17th, May, 2021 and issued by the presiding judge, Justice M.O. Ighodalo (now deceased), hence, the recent protest by the company.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, a Legal luminary clears air on the controversies surrounding the recent allegations of land grabbing levelled against the Ohen Ovbokhan Igbinovia of Okhuoromi Village in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. In this encounter with Idahosa Moses and Oise Monday, Prince Peter Uwadiae, Esq, Counsel to Ohen Ovbokhan and Okhuoromi, submits from the points of law, why those alleging should not be taken seriously.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nIndeed, the law that creates a court also encapsulates or embedded that same court with the authority to punish anybody that infrared on the authority and jurisdiction of the court. What I mean by this is that, assuming without considering that there is a violation of the court order, the court has the mechanism to discipline anybody that has contempted it.This particular issue is very disturbing that Shalom Jare Ventures Limited would hold anybody from Okhuoromi responsible or said to had been in breached of any order of court. Let me just quickly say this, the hostility between Okhuoromi and Shalom Jare started in 2018. Prior to 2018, in 2017 particularly on the 4th of January, 2017. After His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin had adjudicated over the matter between Okhuoromi, Egbirhe and Akuse, he delegated his functionaries to go and demarcate the boundary between Okhuoromi and Aruogba on one part, and Okhuoromi and Egbirhe on the other part.\n\nThe day the representatives of His Royal Majesty went to carry out that boundary demarcations, person\u2019s from Okhuoromi, Egbirhe and Aruogba were there present. It was the Oba\u2019s representatives that created the boundaries between Aruogba and Okhuoromi and Okhuoromi and Egbirhe. From that 4th of January, 2017, the portion of the land has been adjudged to be that of Okhuoromi and Okhuoromi took possession of that part of Land from that particular day. But, for the avoidance of doubt, there was no work of Shalom Jare going-on on this part of the land and not even a single Palm tree was being harvested by them. It was a bush and palm trees that were unproduced were in the area.\n\nFrom the day Okhuoromi took over the portion of the land, there was no problem until sometime in 2018 , after a year and six months that Shalom Jare went to file action in court and it is a law that when a particular claimant approach a court and file for an interim injunction, the court has not had the opportunity of hearing the other party, the court may grant an interim injunction. But in our law too, that interim injunction is to last only for 14 days. When they got the interim injunction in 2018, we have not been served with any court process. Eventually, we were served with the processes filed in court and we filed our defense. When we filed our defense, the Judge that was handling the issue that time, Late Justice Ighodalo, said that from the processes filed by the defendants, there was no need to continue with interlocutories. The court did not considered their interlocutory injunction. By the application of the law, from that moment, the interim injunction which they are parading up till today ceases to exist; ( It dies a natural death).\n\nAssuming without considering that it did no die 14 days after it grant, it dies when the court refused to grant the interlocutory injunction. From that moment, there was no inhibition of any kind because, before the hostilities even started, Okhuoromi were already in possession of the land. By the operation of the law, even if there is an interim injunction or interlocutory injunction and the status quo ante belon is to be maintained. What is the status quo ante belon as at the time hostility started? It shows or suffice to say that the status quo ante belon before hostility started is what was in existence before the case was filed in court. As at 2018 when Shalom Jare filed their action in court, this portion of land was already being in possession of Okhuoromi for over a year and six months following the demarcation done by HRM\n\nAgain, the law is also very clear that when a judge that granted an injunction or any order ceases to be the judge presiding over that matter, every order granted by him ceases to exist because the case is starting De Novo. There are Appeal and Supreme Courts authorities on it. Ngige Vs Obi is one of the cases, that once there is a change of a judge hearing a matter and the case starts De Novo and being held by another judge, every order granted by the previous judge ceases to exist. So, what Shalom Jare is still parading as an order has ceased to exist with the demise of the judge that granted it. Assuming it did not ceases to exist after 14 days, there is no interlocutory order granted by the court.\n\nNow as we stand, this case is pending in court and between the time that Justce Ighodalo died and the case was re-assigned to another judge, there was nothing whatsoever stopping Okhuoromi from taken over possession of what has been rightly adjudged to be their own. However, let me quickly say this, the case is pending in court, it has not been adjudged to be property of Shalom Jare by any court of competent jurisdiction. They filed the matter in court and they are aware that the matter that is still pending in court has been fixed for October this year for hearing.\n\nBesides that, there is a judgement from a court of competent jurisdiction that was delivered by the former Chief Judge of Edo State, Honourable Justice Esther Edigin rtd. And what the former CJ said in that judgement is that the Judgement of HRM which was the traditional Arbitration that looks into such cases prevails and still prevail up till now. If the judgment of the Oba that says a particular piece of land is that of Okhuoromi, that same judgement has been reaffirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, who is now in contempt? Is it Shalom Jare or Okhuoromi? I will venture to say that Shalom Jare does not have any claim to that land.\n\nFunny enough, while the case that led to the judgment of rtd Justice Edigin was pending , their own case was also pending. And I told the court then that this their claimed land is a fraction, an integral part of the case pending before the then CJ. The court advised Shalom Jare that look, there is a case pending that is more elaborate, embracing this particular land in another court. Why don\u2019t you (Shalom Jare) withdraw yours and join this particular case that is pending in court 1 then. Other persons that have similar cases withdrew their own. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria , Dan Okoh, SAN, was doing a case for Eboigbe Ages Water in another court and when he got to know that this particular court that is handling this particular case was all embracing and pending before Court 1, he withdrew his case in court 10 and filed a joinder and joined the case that was more embracing. And the case was holistically heard. But that advise was not taken by Shalom Jare.\n\nNow, there is a judgement that deals with the entire land including this their land in dispute then. Again, assuming without preempting the judgment because it subjundice of the court in charge of this matter, I want to also say this, they have been written petitions to the police and we have gone to the police and let the police know that once a case is pending in the court, it is subjundice and the police do not have the right to investigate a case that a court of competent jurisdiction is handling. Assuming without considering that there was an order of court that has not been obeyed, is it not the same court that granted the order that should punish for it? Does the police have the right to now go and be investigating a case that the Court is handling? That is the big question!\n\nI do not expect a lawyer worth it salt to tell the police to come and intervene in a matter that is subjundice. It is an aberration, unheard of, unethical and very shameful for that to happen. I watch their protest on Television, and the persons who were even demonstrating are not Shalom Jare Ventures, but representatives of Shalom Jare. And what Shalom Jare is even saying you is that, I mean by their pleading they are not even in occupation of the land in dispute. They rented the place out to somebody and yet you filed an action as a company. Now the area they said their business is, from a reliable source, they have sold a lager potion of it allegedly to a company who have even gone into demolishing the place. I will want journalists to visit the area in question wether there is any human activities on the entire land including the one they bought from Aruogba.\n\nSo, it is very disturbing, most embarrassing, illegal and shameful on the part of these persons who do not want to respect the law. They want to take the law unto them and be the judge in their own case. A case that is pending in court, you claim that the land is your own whereas you have filed an action in court for the court to determine the ownership. The court has not pronounced on it. Whereas there is also subsisting judgment that encompassed the entire land. The people that have the judgment are not shouting, they are still saying okay we will follow you to the end of the case you have filed in court. I will say that these people should know what to do and do it in a civilised way. We are not in a lawless society and they can not resort to self help when they have already submitted to the jurisdiction of a court. That is my position.\n\n...",

There were no deaths in Week 30 (July 26-August 1) but there were 12 confirmed cases of the infection.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases then dropped from 12 in Week 30 to four in Week 31, but one death was recorded. The four cases were reported from Ondo and Edo states.\n\nInfections increased in Week 32 (August 9-15) as the number of confirmed cases was 31 with infections coming from Edo, Ondo, and Enugu states.\n\nThe total number of confirmed cases nationwide is now 354. Of the number, Edo has 158, while Ondo trails with 117.\n\nOf the fatalities, Ondo has the highest, with a total of 38, followed by Edo with 14. Others are Taraba, 12; Ebonyi, 2; Bauchi, 2; Kaduna, 4; and Enugu, 1.\n\nGovernment officials in Ondo and Edo believe that they are winning the fight against Lassa fever, given the fact that at the current week in 2020, about 1,060 cases had been confirmed, with 220 deaths, compared with the 354 confirmed cases and 73 deaths recorded so far in 2021.",

          "text": "Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over his latest move to create grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen across the country.\n\nBuhari had on Thursday, announced the approval for a committee to review \u2018with dispatch\u2019 the 368 grazing sites across 25 states in the country, a move that has been opposed by many Nigerians.\n\nReacting to the decision in a statement through his spokesman Terver Akase on Friday, Ortom said it has now become clear that the presidency wants to plunge the country into avoidable crisis.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked and disappointed to read a statement from the Presidency indicating that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved recommendations of a committee to review \u2018with dispatch,\u2019 368 grazing sites, across 25 states in the country, to determine the levels of encroachment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a country where insecurity has reached an all-time high with hundreds being killed by armed herdsmen, bandits and other terrorists, the Presidency is only bordered about animals and their safety and is deploying all machinery and arsenals of government to impose grazing reserves and cattle routes on Nigerians. This is unacceptable!\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the presidency wants to plunge the country into avoidable crisis. Otherwise, what is the justification for President Buhari\u2019s insistence that grazing reserves be established across the country when Nigerians have openly kicked against the policy and have embraced ranching in place of open grazing?\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that millions of Nigerians have been displaced following attacks by armed herders and are currently suffering in IDP camps, stressing that Benue state for instance has over 1.5 million displaced people with thousands living in camps and many more forced to flee their ancestral lands to stay under dehumanizing conditions in open fields.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe Buhari administration does not seem to be worried about the food crisis already ravaging the country. Farmers have been chased into IDP camps by herders and children are dying of starvation, yet what is more important to their President is the well being of cows.\n\n\u201cWe expected the pitiable condition of the displaced people to be the preoccupation of the President whom they voted in 2015 and 2019. It is unfortunate that the people\u2019s love, trust and votes for Mr President are being rewarded with hate, cruelty and dictatorial policies aimed at grabbing their lands to donate to herders and cows.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference between the Buhari administration\u2019s approach to insecurity and the Taliban agenda in Afghanistan? It is now evident that the government at the centre prioritizes the welfare of cattle over human beings and is bent on taking Nigeria back to the precolonial era. The country has been turned to a cow republic by the present administration.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government introduced the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and Nigerians accepted the policy. Why has the Buhari administration dumped the programme and opted for grazing reserves and cattle routes?\n\n\u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom has repeatedly stated that there is no land for grazing reserves or cattle routes in Benue State. Though the Federal Government craftily concealed the names of states where Mr President has ordered that grazing reserves be foisted on the people, we wish to categorically state that no part of Benue will be allocated for grazing reserves or cattle routes!\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari must actualize his cattle agenda in Benue State, he should be ready to kill all of us! We know that grazing reserves and cattle routes are the only project that the President has for Nigeria, but Benue is not interested in such a project.\u201d",

          "text": "Hard knocks came the way of President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday over his unrelenting idea to re-chart grazing routes and grazing reserves in 25 states for his Fulani herdsmen.\n\nThe condemnation came from both Benue Governor Samuel Ortom and the Yoruba political group, Afenifere.\n\nOrtom who has vehemently kicked against the idea renewed his criticism at Yandev, Gboko Local Government Area during the burial of Emmanuel Amaatimin.\n\nHe said Benue people reject the policy in its entirety.\n\n\u201cLet the President know that Benue State has the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in place and we are not going to allow any other thing outside this in Benue.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, the Federal Government and the President do not have the right to preside over the land of Benue State.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria allows Governors to hold in trust the land that belongs to the States.\n\n\u201cIf the President wants land in Benue, he will seek my permission and I will in turn seek the consent of Benue people.\n\n\u201cThe President cannot say that cattle routes and grazing areas will be designated in Benue State. We say no to it and I say that on behalf of Benue people.\u201d\n\nOrtom wondered why Buhari has not publicly condemned the activities of herdsmen, saying he should be the President for all and not only Fulanis.\n\nYoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, also slammed the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari for review of 368 Grazing Reserves across 25 States as a plot to annex land for herders.\n\nThe group said it did not surprise Nigerians that the President is still wasting tax- payers\u2019 scare resources on a programme, which lacks all conceivable growth capacity.\n\nSecretary General of Afenifere, Sola Ebiseni, in a statement in Akure said the policy reeked of odiferous stench of ethnic agenda for settlement of the Fulani in the ancestral lands of other ethnic nationalities.\n\nThe group said non-Fulani Nigerians were not stupid and are aware that the concept of grazing reserve was a worse form of official dispossession of their ancestral lands for the inheritance and use of the Fulani than Cattle Colony, RUGA and Grazing Routes, which they have rejected.\n\n\u201cWe recall and support the Resolutions of the Nigerian Governors, particularly from the South of the country, banning all forms of open grazing and it does not matter to us that some elected governors, in a federation, would condescend so low to functioning as members of a Committee presided over by an appointed aide of the President, no matter the name in which his office is painted.\n\n\u201cThe concept of Grazing Reserves, otherwise known as Hurumi, which was introduced during the colonial and immediately after independence failed in the north particularly in the Middle Belt provinces, notwithstanding a monolithic one North government and permissive land use regime.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, let the President be told that the constitution which he reveres relentlessly and the Land Use Act which derives equal force there from, extol the majesty of the people over their land.\n\n\u201cEven the Governor who holds the land in his State in trust for the people cannot dispossess any citizen thereof, except for proven overriding public interest through the due process of law.\n\n\u201cThe current exercise is not only a waste of tax payers\u2019 money, it is a sweet pipe dream in a fool\u2019s paradise. Every herder has a State of origin.\n\n\u201cLet the governments of the respective states make arrangements for settled life for them in the territory where the culture is fully appreciated.\u201d\n\nAfenifere also said the grazing agenda being pushed by President Buhari is a script of the Fulani intelligentsia.",

          "text": "\n\nBy Jethro Ibileke/Benin\n\nAlhaji Idriss Adanno, the man who would have been installed today as Sultan of Shuwa Arabs of Edo State, has canceled all activities planned for the event.\n\nAdanno who addressed a section of journalists in Benin, on Friday, alleged that the program of activities for his coronation was grossly misinterpreted by Nigerians, due to the language used by the organisers.\n\nHe pledged his loyalty to the Benin Monarch, Oba Ewuare II, who he described as father to all northerners in the State.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue was misunderstood because of the language used. All the tribes from the north who are resident in Edo State are all under the Sarkin Hausawa but we all now have our individual Sarkin like those of Kanuri, Nupe and others.\n\n\u201cIn our Shuwa language, Sultan is our own Sarkin and we only wanted to celebrate my appointment as the head of Shuwa Arabs in Benin because we are the second-largest local ethnic group from the north.\n\n\u201cWe are all under Sarkin Hausawa of Benin who gave us an introductory letter which we submitted before the Governor of the State, the Oba of Benin and the Secretary to State Government.\n\n\u201cWe are all law-abiding citizens and under the laws of the State. We are also loyal to our Royal father, the Oba of Benin, who is father to all of us.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the State Government for the mix-up and as law-abiding citizens, we have also cancelled all the activities we wanted to do as directed by the State Government,\u201d Addano explained.\n\nAlso speaking, the Sarkin Hausawa of Benin, Alhaji Adamu Isa, emphasized that the whole incident was misunderstood due to the choice of language.\n\n\u201cThey are a community resident in Edo and they have a large percentage of their people here too, they are into cattle-breeding and other businesses. The thing is a misuse of language from them.\n\n\u201cAbout five months ago, they came to me that since they are large, they want to have a traditional head so I told them to go and look for someone among them who is going to be their leader and so they came with one Idris and then some issues came up then I asked them to go and resolve it and I gave them a date to come back.\n\n\u201cAnd then we did the turban of their leader so that in case we have issues concerning them, we know who to hold responsible.\n\n\u201cYou know our culture, it is easier for you to regulate the activities of people using the traditional heads, that is why anytime we have a large set of people from the same place, we look for a traditional head.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue was misunderstood. I was born and bred here in Benin, my father was born and bred here in Benin so I understand the tradition and custom of the land and the laws of the State. It was just a misuse of language. Sultan in their own language means Sarkin,\u201d Isa stressed.\n\nWhile Adanno was making arrangements for his coronation in Benin City, the Shehu of Borno on 4 August in Maiduguri, turbaned Adam Harun for the same title.\n\nThe turbaning was unknown to many residents in Edo.\n\nThe development exposed the disunity among the Shuwa people in the State.",

He said Okolie was later transferred to Abuja.\n\n\u201c21-year-old Miss Glory Okolie who enrolled for 2021 JAMB exam has been in police detention since 17th June, 2021 till date. She left the house and never returned,\u201d the activist wrote on Facebook. Weekly Prayers\n\n\u201cSince 17th June, her families had searched for her in hospitals and mortuaries but couldn\u2019t find her.\n\n\u201cEnding of June, 2021, a young man who was freed from IRT office Tiger Base Owerri told the Okolie family that he saw Glory in the custody of IRT officers cooking and washing clothes for them.\n\n\u201cThe family immediately went to IRT office and requested to see Glory and bail her out and till date it\u2019s been one story or the other. The IRT officers allegedly continued to extort the family and denied them access to see Glory.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with the Punch, the activist said his team met with Olatunji Disu, the newly-appointed IRT boss, on Thursday, but the police could not link the lady with any offence aside being the girlfriend of a suspected member of IPOB.\n\n\u201cThe office is cooperating with us. The current head of the unit said he just resumed and that the IG commissioned a committee to look into people arrested for IPOB issues after the Glory story went viral.

Only an environment of industrial harmony can guarantee that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigerian aviation sector, I dare say that the various labour unions have tried to play this role effectively. This role enables labour unions to ensure that cordial and good understanding between employers and employees could be established in the workplace and leads to a harmonious and conducive working environment. It is such an environment that results in higher organizational and individual productivity,\u201d Sirika added.",
