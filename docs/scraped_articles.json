Investigations showed that about N17.5m has passed through her accounts to the IPOB/ESN members. Her complicity in IPOB\u2019s activities has been established by police investigators.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the force explained in a statement on Sunday that Gloria was arrested for \u201cher complicity in the series of deliberate and well-coordinated attacks on security formations, other critical national infrastructure, including INEC offices, and killing of security operatives in the south-eastern part of the country.\u201d\n\nThe statement, signed by the Deputy Force Spokesman, Aremu Adeniran, was titled, \u2018Violent attacks in the South-East: Police arrest militants\u2019 spy girl\u2019.\n\nIt said the suspect would be arraigned after investigation.\n\nThe police said their investigation revealed that Gloria was a member of IPOB/ESN in Imo State, who worked closely with one Benjamin Emojiri, aka Onye Army, an ESN commander earlier declared wanted by the police for his alleged roles in executing the attack on the Imo State Police Command headquarters and the state headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Service.\n\nThe force noted that the suspect, a native of Umutanza in Imo State, was arrested following ongoing investigations and implementation of special operation, Operation Restore Peace, aimed at breaking the information, drugs and arms supply chain to IPOB and the ESN.\n\nIt explained that Gloria\u2019s arrest and her confession assisted the detectives in the arrest of Onye Army.\n\nThe statement further read, \u201cFurther investigations by the police team revealed that Gloria Okolie takes advantage of her gender and seemingly innocuous looks as camouflage to carry out espionage against military and police targets on behalf of IPOB/ESN.\n\n\u201cThe suspect also serves as an intermediate person, who receives cash, drugs and weapons on behalf of IPOB/ESN, and delivers the same to their commanders in their camps.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Moses Aransiola, said that, prayer was needed to unlock the nation from its shackles that have held it captive for long.\n\nAccording to him, all the factors whether spiritual or physical that are hindering the nation from taking its rightful position in the comity of nations have to surrender when take part in corporate prayer.\n\n\u201cThose forces of misrule, corruption, nepotism, religious intolerant, and political disharmony that has made the country to remain at latent level through our prayer must give way for a formidable Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prayer group director, who described the migration of the nations prime youths to other countries for green pasture as horrifying; offered violent prayer to halt the trend and its cause.\n\nHe added that Nigeria prays was a spiritual investment by the group on behalf of Nigeria and Nigerians for a good society.\n\nIn his appraisal for the programme, Apostle Chunks Alozie, Abia Coordinator and South East Zonal Coordinator for Nigeria Prays, said that the session was biblical.\n\nAlozie noted that since its inception 25 years ago, there have been testimonies of the prayer.\n\nHe added that the intercession of the group and those of others were what has being keeping the nation united in spite of myriad of crises.\n\nNAN reports that the event was hosted by the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Good Shepherd Parish, Yaba, Lagos.",

          "text": "The youth wing of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has called on security agencies to thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding what led to the Rukuba road killings on Saturday, 14 August, 2021, in Plateau State.\n\nThe forum noted that the investigation is necessary to determine whether one of the vehicles in the convoy of those attacked was carrying a large cache of arms.\n\nA statement issued and made available to DAILY POST in Kaduna on Monday by the MBF youth wing National leader, Nasiru Jagaba, the youths condemned in strong terms the attempt by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) to label the Irigwe ethnic nationality as the perpetrators of the killings, saying that they (Irigwe) were deeply involved in the burial of their people killed by heartless herdsmen.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Youth Wing of the Middle Belt Region calls on relevant security agencies to investigate thoroughly the circumstances surrounding this attack to determine whether one of the vehicles in the convoy was carrying a large cache of arms. We condemn the attempt by the CNG to label the Irigwe ethnic nationality as the perpetrators of these killings as they were deeply involved in the burial of their people killed by heartless herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThe Irigwe people have rightly distanced themselves from the reprehensible and devious act and challenged the police to prove their culpability. It is now the responsibility of the police to1 prove the culpability of the Irigwe people.\u201d\n\nPlateau Attacks: Herders killed 41 people in Irigwe in four months- Communities demand justice\n\nThe group noted that while they condemned the attacks and offer their heartfelt sympathies to victims and relations of the dead, they are appalled by CNG\u2019s \u201cmalevolent attempt\u201d at painting the unfortunate incident in religious and ethnic colouration.\n\nIt explained that Middle Belt youths are surprised that despite what it described as \u201cthe intermittent coldblooded murders\u201d on the Plateau and other parts of the North, the group only found its voice when some elements attacked travellers.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cIt is on record that not only Plateau State but the entire North has been turned into a river of bloodshed, with hundreds of communities decimated and thousands of innocent citizens killed without a whimper from the group.\u201d\n\nMore worrisome, according to the statement, is the deliberate attempt at demonising the Irigwe ethnic nationality as perpetrators of these killings have been orchestrated without any evidence, saying that not only were hundreds of homes reduced into rubble in five Irigwe communities, no fewer than 76 Irigwe persons were brutally murdered within a span of four days in the last two weeks without any attempt by the security forces to bring the killers to justice.\n\nIt lamented, \u201cWhile these murderers have been enmeshed in destroying lives, homes and vast swathes of farmlands, the CNG embraced silence and looked the other way. The CNG seems to be available for the highest bidder and only found its voice when the victims of the Saturday attack turned out to be Fulani people. That the CNG would quickly address the press on the incident and call for the arrest of Irigwe monarchs in the troubled areas shows that the group is engaged in fanning the embers of violence.\u201d\n\nAccording to youths, there seems to be a veil over what truly happened in Jos last Saturday, saying that if actually the travellers were coming from Bauchi, it is incongruous that instead of passing through Bauchi Road, what were their reasons for preferring the Rukuba Road leading to Miango where Irigwe people were engaged in mass burial of their members that were killed?\n\nThe youths noted with heavy hearts that despite outcries from communities and patriotic Nigerians calling on the Federal Government to halt further genocidal attacks on their communities, their people living in the Middle Belt Region have been abandoned by the government and left to the mercy of their attackers.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked that despite the horrifying cynosure of massacre unleashed on the Irigwe people and other ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Zone, the government and relevant security agencies have played the ostrich and refused to deploy genuine efforts at combating these murdering monsters,\u201d the youths explained.\n\nArising from the bland disposition of security agencies in bringing to justice murderers of innocent Nigerians, the Middle Belt Youth Wing called on CNG and other groups engaged in playing the script of their masters to stop this deceit of double standards that has become its acceptable ethics, adding that the CNG through its press conference is the symbol of an appaling bigotry that is slowly eating up the soul of the nation.\n\nThe youths called on President Muhammadu Buhari to stop applying different standards in resolving the security challenges confronting the country, saying that the blood that flows in the veins of both Irigwe and Fulani people is still red in colour and represents common humanity.\n\nThe Middle Belt Youth Wing called on security agencies to put members of the CNG under serious security watch, explaining that their press conference has the potential of undermining and threatening the peace of not only the North but Nigeria at large.\n\nThe statement called on the attention of the government on the continued killings of university students in Jos, observing that government should do everything to halt further unwarranted attacks on innocent citizens\n\nThe youths further called on the Federal Government to take a closer look at the comments credited to Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi who threatened retaliation in the event the government fails to handle the matter, government must be just to all sides if it is committed to dealing with insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Middle Belt Youths said they are aware that there are plots to subjugate their people and enthrone the Fulani as masters over their people, adding, \u201cWe shall resist such devious efforts within our constitutional rights. Nigerians must not allow themselves to be deceived by the hypocrisy of the CNG that is famed for its double standards.\u201d\n\nKaduna plane crash: Senator Orji Kalu tasks FG on thorough probe of accident",

My grandparents were also sad because they thought they had successfully sent her off to a man\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it didn\u2019t even end there because she did the same thing to my father too. In my father\u2019s case, she had to bathe him with water when he walked up to her at the stream. But as God could have it, she didn\u2019t know she met her match.\n\n\u201cThat act didn\u2019t stop my dad because he was so confident enough to keep going after her even after what she did to him.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents were also happy to be sending her off when they finally concluded the marriage rites because she was a truck load of problems,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nBenue Governor, Samuel Ortom, has threatened to drag President Muhammadu Buhari to court should he insist on going ahead with any policy that would support open grazing or grazing reserves in the country.\n\nOrtom, who spoke with newsmen after arriving Makurdi from Asaba, yesterday, insisted that under his watch, the state would never accept open grazing.\n\nWhile maintaining that the nation\u2019s Constitution supercedes the Northern Nigeria Law that provided for grazing reserves, Governor Ortom said the state government would not accept the Grazing Reserve Policy, insisting that he would rather stand with the National Livestock Transformation Programme.\n\nGovernor Ortom, who wondered why the president has continued to insist on open grazing averred that the state would not concede any land for the policy, noting that such lands do not even exist.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that if the entire country had accepted ranching, then why is Mr. President insisting on open grazing when there is no land for such. In the 50s when this policy was initiated what was the population of Nigeria? It was less that 40 million but today we are more than 200 million. The 923 square kilometer is not even enough to cater for the population. The reason Mr. President is insisting to some of us, I think there is a hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cMr. President has aides, the Attorney General of the Federation, (Abubakar) Malami and other lawyers around him should advise him. For God\u2019s sake, it is laughable and it appears we do not know what we are doing. Under my watch, the state will not accept open grazing. I have already briefed my lawyers should Mr. President insist on going ahead with the policy,\u201d he stated.\n\nMove capable of causing crisis \u2013Lawyer\n\nA lawyer, Mr. Banji Alabi, has expressed worry on the grazing routes policy, saying the initiative was capable of causing crisis in the country.\n\nAlabi, chairman, Governing Council, Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, said the newly introduced grazing route was a grave error of judgment.\n\nHe said the initiative may precipitate another round of violence, arson, armed robbery, rape and kidnapping. He recommended that the National Assembly and the Nigeria\u2019s Governors\u2019 Forum adopt ranching, which he described as a better alternative.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a suit against President Buhari over his alleged failure to probe allegations of missing N106 billion from ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).\n\nSERAP had in a letter dated April 17, asked Buhari to direct the AGF and anti-corruption agencies to investigate the allegation of missing funds.\n\nIt noted that the Federal Government can use the funds to implement the budget, instead of borrowing, if recovered.\n\nThose joined as respondents in the suit include Malami and Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/903/2021 filed last week before a Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking an order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to promptly investigate the alleged missing public funds, ensure prosecution of anyone suspected to be responsible, and the full recovery of the money.\n\nSERAP through its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Joke Fekumo, said: \u201cThe failure to investigate the allegations of grand corruption in the 2018 annual audited report constitutes a grave violation of the duty placed on the Nigerian government to take appropriate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the management of public finances.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s constitutional responsibility to ensure the investigation and prosecution of allegations of corruption, as well as recovery of any missing public funds is contained in Section 15[5] of the Nigerian Constitution, which provides that the state shall abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power\u2019, and in the Oath of Office in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\u201d",

He said it was time the political marginalisation of the South East was brought to an end in the interest of the country\u2019s peace and unity.\n\nHe appealed to leaders of political parties to correct the injustice in 2023 by zoning their presidential tickets to South East.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that every political party in Nigeria should have the task of national unity as their core mandate and as such would do everything within their capacity to ensure the oneness of Nigeria. Nigeria as a country is currently challenged with the agitations of secession. Most of the agitations are based on provable points which all of us cannot shy away from. It is already a problem and all hands must be on deck towards proffering the desired solution.\n\n\u201cNigeria has six geopolitical zones and almost all the zones have produced the President except the South East. This was the same zone that the Nigeria government engaged in a civil war that last for about three years. The region was grossly damaged and there is urgent need to consider them in the zoning of the 2023 presidential election so that as significant progress can be recorded in the journey of healing the wounds and scars of the civil war.\n\n\u201cOther regions should in interest of one Nigeria cede the position of the highest office in the land to the South East. I hereby call on the youths, elders and women who love this country to prevail on all the political parties in the country to zone the position of President to the people of South East.

In states where the citizens do not politicise security issues, they rally round their leaders who had similarly admonished their people.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to suggest that Governor Masari should resign for his patriotic candour and courage in admonition his people to wake up and resist the bandits by acquiring arms for self defence, betrays a sheer lack of the understanding of the letter and spirit as well as the workings of the Nigerian Constitution or a motive which is anything but altruistic,\u201d the statement read in part.",

          "text": "\u2022Intelligence agencies probe authenticity of recent surrender of 1, 200 insurgents\n\n\u2022How they\u2019re given houses, paid monthly stipends\n\nKingsley Nwezeh\n\nin Abuja with agency reports\n\nA United Nations (UN) publication has detailed a secret government programme tagged, Suhlu, designed to pull commanders of terrorists groups, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP) out of the forests, rehabilitate them and provide them a means of livelihood.\n\nThe development is coming as intelligence agencies have begun investigation into the recent surrender of over 1,200 terrorists and their families in the last three weeks.\n\nThe investigation, THISDAY learnt, seeks to ascertain whether the surrender was genuine or a ploy to activate and coordinate terror sleeper cells across the country.\n\nNorth-east communities and traditional institutions have protested the potential reintegration of the insurgents into their communities.\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno State and Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Umar Garbai El-Kanem, had also raised concerns that the communities where thousands of people were killed by the terrorists and houses destroyed might not be in the right frame of mind to accept the surrendered insurgents, who recently sought the forgiveness of Nigerians.\n\nHowever, the report by a United Nations\u2019 publication, The New Humanitarian, said a clandestine Nigerian government programme was reaching out to senior jihadist fighters in the bush to encourage them to abandon their goal of building a caliphate by force of arms, and to defect.\n\nIt said the report was based on six months of reporting and research.\n\nGovernment officials, former jihadists, analysts, journalists, displaced people, and civil society workers were interviewed, but nearly all asked to have their names withheld or altered due to security concerns.\n\nSome have almost certainly committed atrocities but are unlikely to be prosecuted.\n\nThe Bama massacre in 2014 killed hundreds of civilians, but one of the commanders involved is now living free on the government\u2019s payroll.\n\nSecurity officials believe sulhu could open the door to a peace deal, ending a stalemated conflict that is now in its twelfth year. But critics argue such a deal would reward mass killers.\n\nOne of the former commanders and beneficiary of the programme, Aliyu, has a new life now. The old was the decade he spent fighting with Boko Haram and then with the breakaway Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the scrubland of the North-east.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the two wives and four children he left behind when he defected, and the power he once wielded as a jihadist rijal-literally a \u2018man\u2019 \u2013 in zones under the insurgents\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cIn his early thirties, with a wispy goatee, Aliyu has remarried to a forthright woman from the northeastern city of Maiduguri. She is also former Boko Haram, and they have been set up with the rent-free house in Kaduna, a business license, and a small monthly stipend provided by Nigeria\u2019s domestic spy service, better known as DSS\u201d.\n\nThe price of this largesse: to work for DSS to turn other jihadists under a clandestine project known as sulhu \u2013 Arabic for peacemaking. It\u2019s so controversial that no government representative would go on record to discuss it, and given Abuja\u2019s increasing hostility to independent reporting on security matters, few Nigeria-based civil society figures wanted to be named either.\n\nSulhu is applauded by its supporters as smart warfare \u2013 a means to remove senior jihadists from the battlefield more effectively than the stuttering orthodox military campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have a proof of concept; it\u2019s working,\u201d said an Abuja-based analyst, who wouldn\u2019t agree to be identified beyond that description. \u201cIt\u2019s depleting the enemy\u2019s fighting force.\u201d\n\nBut the men on the Sulhu programme are almost certain to have been involved in atrocities. They have not been granted a formal amnesty, but neither have they been held to account for any crimes committed in a brutal conflict that is now in its twelfth year.\n\nIt\u2019s a war that has killed 35,000 people \u2013 350,000 if you include the victims of the accelerating humanitarian crisis \u2013 and upended the lives of millions more, according to the UN.\n\n\u201cThese are mass killers, yet on a programme sponsored by Nigerian taxpayers,\u201d explained a former government-Boko Haram intermediary.\n\nHe has been in touch with the movement almost from the start, when it was still a local religious sect led by a young cleric, Mohammed Yusuf, before it declared war on the Nigerian state in 2009.\n\nSulhu grew out of the behind-the-scenes attempts to free the more than 270 Chibok schoolgirls seized by Boko Haram in 2014.\n\nAfter years of painstaking contact-making through a network of mediators, it dawned on the negotiators that not only did they have an opening to secure the release of some of the schoolgirls, but there were also Mujahideen signalling they might be open to dialogue \u2013 a potential breakthrough in a deadlocked conflict.\n\nA total of 150 Mujahideen have surrendered their weapons and crossed over since 2019, according to people familiar In the last few weeks, there has been a separate surge, related to internal feuding within the jihadist movement following the death this May of Abubakar Shekau, who had led Boko Haram since 2009.\n\nSome of those Mujahideen, like Aliyu, were commanders, known as qaid \u2013 in charge of several districts. Such was the importance attached to the initial group that they were invited to Abuja, where they met representatives of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nUnder Sulhu, defectors are enrolled in a six-month \u201cderadicalisation\u201d course in the military\u2019s demobilisation and reintegration centre in Mallam Sidi, in northeastern Gombe State.\n\nAfter promising to renounce violence and be good citizens, they are issued with a graduation certificate, signed by a high court judge \u2013 and some have then gone on to set up businesses, from cap-making to chicken-rearing.\n\nSulhu is run by DSS and the military, but is separate from the army\u2019s much larger disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration initiative, known as Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) and also based in Mallam Sidi.\n\nOSC is aimed at low-risk former combatants, although as many as 75 per cent of those on the programme may never have held a weapon \u2013 just villagers snagged in the military\u2019s catch-all dragnets, with years spent in detention without trial.\n\nThose on the Sulhu initiative are the turbaned rijal seen in the low-res YouTube videos, exultant in victory, killing without remorse.\n\nBefore joining ISWAP, prior to the 2016 split from Boko Haram, these men had been obedient to a maximalist \u201ctakfir\u201d creed, promoted by then-leader Shekau, who declared that anybody living outside their zone of control was an infidel, punishable by death or enslavement.\n\nMore than 1,000 Boko Haram fighters have surrendered to the army in the last few weeks \u2013 handing over the weapons they carried.\n\nISWAP is militarily on the front foot, but there can be exhaustion with the years of conflict for any number of reasons, explained a Nigeria-based researcher, who asked not to be named so they could speak freely.\n\n\u201cSome [defectors] have lost faith in their leaders, accusing them of corruption; some have even forgotten why they were fighting; others just want their children to go to school.\u201d\n\nBut allowing jihadists to return to civilian life is clearly problematic. The military\u2019s far more limited OSC initiative, resettling low-risk Boko Haram, has run into a wall of criticism \u2013 including from some senior politicians, who misrepresent Mallam Sidi as a holiday resort, where \u201ckillers\u201d are pampered.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no appetite from the government to even begin to publicly discuss Sulhu.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of buy-in and a lot of pushback from sections of the military and political office holders, who don\u2019t see the need for this process,\u201d said an Abuja-based lawyer.\n\nYet almost 60 per cent of people surveyed across the northeast in 2018 said they could agree to reconciliation with repentant jihadists if that was a path to peace: though acceptance was far lower in areas hardest hit by the conflict, and among women \u2013 the victims of so much sexual violence.\n\nAliyu feels relatively comfortable in big cities like Kaduna and Maiduguri. But there are places where he knows he would receive a far rougher reception. \u201cPeople suffered,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThey lost a lot [because of us].\u201d\n\nFor DSS, Sulhu makes strategic sense. Aliyu, for example, is a so-called \u201cpioneer\u201d, an early member of Boko Haram as well as a qaid \u2013 this means he has a deep and intimate knowledge of the movement and the men he fought with.\n\nThe Humanitarian said, \u201cSince he crossed over two years ago, his job has been to find other rijal wavering in their commitment to the jihadist cause. He says he has personally persuaded more than 20 of them to slip into frontline northern towns like Geidam, make pre-arranged contact with the military, and then start their journey into the Sulhu programme.\n\n\u201cAll he needs is a cell phone and recharge card. When his connections pop up, sometimes in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger \u2013 the rear bases of the insurgency \u2013 he pumps them for news and gossip. Then, when he judges the time is right, he badgers them to quit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy conversation. Uppermost in any potential defector\u2019s mind is the fear of being sent to Giwa Barracks, a notorious detention facility on the edge of a quiet Maiduguri suburb.\n\n\u201cEveryone is afraid of that place, and the people in the lake [Chad] don\u2019t trust the government [won\u2019t send them there],\u201d said Aliyu. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Giwa, more would come \u2013 [the abuse that happens there] is the biggest mistake the military has made.\u201d\n\nThe conversations aren\u2019t one-way, either. Aliyu\u2019s former comrades bait him, reminding him of the life he led in the Dawla \u2013 the territory ISWAP administers under shariah law and regards as independent from Nigeria.\n\nIn this zone, in the far north of Borno and Yobe States, beyond the reach of the military and aid agencies, rijal have almost total power over at least one million villagers they refer to as awam \u2013 or \u201ccommoners\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey say when you were in the lake [a region controlled by ISWAP], you were somebody important, now you have nothing,\u201d Aliyu explained, and you can feel the loss of prestige irks him.\n\nThe logo on his otherwise clean t-shirt is loose, and the seam in the crutch of his faded black trousers is coming apart. But there is still an air of entitlement about him.\n\nHe was mock scandalised by the price of a bottle of water in the quiet restaurant, where The New Humanitarian first interviewed him, and he feigned outrage that motorbike taxis were not allowed into the middle-class district.\n\n\u201cI will always fight injustice wherever I see it,\u201d Aliyu said grandly, seemingly the qaid \u2013 in his own mind at least \u2013 he once was.\n\nMothers and Sons\n\nThe publication noted that it\u2019s unclear why Aliyu chose to run. There was a suggestion by some close to jihadist networks that he and some of his men had rustled cattle in the Lake Chad region and he was about to be punished.\n\nISWAP considers stealing from Muslims a crime. Unlike the more predatory Boko Haram under Shekau, it has tended to think more about civilian hearts and minds.\n\nAliyu denied he was at fault. Instead, he described a falling out with ISWAP\u2019s then-commander of the army, Mustapha Kirimima, whose aggressive hardline stance persuaded others to also leave.\n\nKirimima is reportedly in detention after a leadership shuffle earlier this year that made Abu Musab al-Barnawi \u2013 the eldest surviving son of the founder of Boko Haram \u2013 the interim leader.\n\nAliyu is trying to rebuild his life. He\u2019s in school, learning to read and write English, and keen on it. He attends a regular mosque \u2013 nothing radical \u2013 and is close to his new wife.\n\n\u201cOne day, they [the community] will find out we are Boko Haram, but if we are together, we can bear [the stigma],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf all mothers could welcome their sons, those in the forests, tell them no harm will come to them, they will come home\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, intelligence agencies have begun investigation of the surrender of over 1,200 terrorists and their families.\n\nThe investigation, THISDAY learnt, seeks to ascertain whether the surrender was genuine or a ploy to activate and coordinate terror sleeper cells across the country.\n\nNorth-east communities and traditional institutions have protested the potential reintegration of the insurgents into their communities.\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno State and Shehu of Borno, HRH Abubakar El-Kanemi, had raised concerns that the communities where thousands of people were killed by the terrorists and houses destroyed might not be in the right frame of mind to accept the insurgents, who recently sought the forgiveness of Nigerians.\n\nA source told THISDAY that there were concerns and the need to be certain that the repentant insurgents had good intentions.\n\n\u201cThere is the need to be sure of what we have on our hands. Do we have people, who are eager to give up or is it a strategy to spread across the country and continue the spread of terror\u201d, a source said.\n\nAttempts to access the reaction of the military high command was unsuccessful.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Sukuk: FG Borrowed N350bn in Three Years for Road Projects, Says Jaiz Bank",
          "text": "\u2022Backs CBN\u2019s move against BDCs\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive, Jaiz Bank Plc, Mr. Hassan Usman, has disclosed that the federal government utilised Islamic financing instruments, particularly the Sukuk, to raise over N350 billion within the past three years to execute road projects across the country.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, a sister broadcast arm of THISDAY over the weekend, Usman also said that the bank has been able to expand credit to the real sector of the economy, financing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well as working with women, vulnerable groups and those at the bottom of the pyramid to deepen financial inclusion.\n\nAlso, commenting on the recent decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to work with commercial banks rather than Bureau De Change operators in administering foreign exchange to customers, the Jaiz Bank boss said the banks have the traditional mandate to engage in forex transaction.\n\nHe pointed out however, that the apex bank in a bid to bring forex services closer to customers decided to use the BDCs, a privilege which he said, had been abused by the latter.\n\nOn the growing appeal for ethical financing option, he said, \u201cThis mode of financing for public expenditure means you cannot divert the resources, you cannot use the monies raised except for that which you have intended. So it gives credence to the utilisation and also ensure that this resources are earmarked for specific developmental projects.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNow if you look the other side where you are looking at the SMEs, Islamic finance tends to be more risk bearing and sharing with the SMEs and so encouraging this type of financing or banking means that the SMEs sector can grow with the support of this type of financing which shares risks and reward of whatever business is done.\u201d\n\nUsman, while backing the CBN\u2019s decision to engage the deposit money banks to undertake foreign exchange transactions going forward, said, \u201cAs you know, traditionally, it\u2019s the banks\u2019 job to provide all of these anyway but in other to bring this very close to the customer that\u2019s why the central bank was using the Bureau De change.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, this process had been abused and it\u2019s becoming a very huge hole for leakages in the system. I think that the banks, if you watched over the last couple of years have been trying to be very responsible and very conscious of the need of the nation and banks have come to participate in every issue and every situation that requires our help under the leadership of the governor of the central bank and the bankers\u2019 committee.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cThey tried to do almost everything that is possible to support the community and the government to deliver whether it is social services or some national issues to intervene where necessary.\n\n\u201cAnd this is also a case where the bankers\u2019 committee has taken this assignment very seriously not only to ensure that foreign exchange is available to customers but also to strengthen the system so that those who are gaming this system would be checked out and be dealt with.\n\n\u201cAnd so that the nation will be better for it because few people should not be gaming our system and making policy strategies of the fiscal and monetary authorities impossible.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that Islamic financing tends to be more involving and therefore ensures extra disciple in the utilisation of resources to guarantee delivery.\n\nHe said the financing instrument also further creates the right environment for Public-Private Partnerships where the private sector using Islamic banking products could work with the government to develop long term infrastructure as the profit sharing arrangement allows that to happen.\n\nHe added that since 2012 when the bank started operations, it has been able to grow its activities around financing the real sector of the economy as well as financing and nurturing new companies and industries amidst the challenging business environment.\n\nHe said, \u201cRather than a loan, we give them equity and share in their profits and the downside, if it happens, we also are ready to do that by controlling the risk environment and ensuring that people do not take advantage of that product with the type of discipline through the group arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe Jaiz Bank MD attributed the company\u2019s recent positive financial performances to its commitment to customer base to create value and, \u201cshare that value between us with very high level of equity around it and that makes them to patronise the organisation the more.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ve also tried to consolidate and expand to cover many areas of the commercial centers in Nigeria in addition to the fact that with the introduction of the Sukuk, our treasury function has improved because if you know that for more than six years of our life as a bank, we didn\u2019t have instruments to invest our surplus liquidity into until the Sukuk came in 2017.\u201d\n\nHe said through a number of initiatives, the bank had been able to grow profits at over 50 per cent annually as well as the size of the organisation which had grown at over 30 per cent within the last three to four years.\n\nThe Managing Director further stated that the bank grew its balance sheet by about 40 per cent in 2020 while its risk assets/financing also increased by 54 per cent while customer deposits also grew by about 40 per cent.\n\nHe added that despite the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank experienced a relatively successful year adding that this positive trend had persisted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "APC Chairmanship Battle Hots Up",
          "text": "*Akume, Al-Makura, Shettima, Yari, Adamu, others join race\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAs the All Progressives Congress (APC) prepares for its national convention later in the year, following the nod received from the governors of the ruling party, many aspirants have intensified their lobby to succeed the Chairman of the National Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nProminent among the APC chairmanship aspirants are a two-term governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Abdulaziz Yari; two-term Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura; another two-term governor of the state, Senator Abdullahi Adamu; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; a former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and another former Governor of the state, Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\nA former governorship aspirant in Kwara State, Mr. Salihu Mustapha, is also in the race and is the youngest aspirant, while speculations are rife that a former Governor of Gombe State and senator representing Gombe Central senatorial zone, Senator Danjuma Goje, is also in the race to succeed Buni.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the Ondo State governorship election, which put a question mark on Buni\u2019s dual role as governor and chairman of the ruling party, coupled with multiple litigations challenging his position, APC governors had given the Buni-led committee a go-ahead to organise the party\u2019s local government and state congresses, as well as national convention.\n\nThe latest in the gale of litigations challenging Buni\u2019s chairmanship of the APC was filed last week by Mr. Samuel Irabor on behalf of 100 members of the party, urging the Federal High Court in Abuja to dissolve the Buni-led 13-member caretaker committee of the APC.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs also told the court that the chairmanship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC Constitution.\n\nIt is also the contention of the plaintiffs that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer Oath of Office to Buni as caretaker chairman of the party.\n\nHowever, despite all the suits challenging the legality of the Yobe State governor\u2019s appointment as the chairman of his party, the APC governors had thrown their weight behind the Buni-led committee to organise the national convention.\n\nThough the ruling party had on many occasions clarified that it had not zoned the presidency and other offices ahead of the 2023 general election, all the aspirants for the party\u2019s chairmanship position are from the North.\n\nThis has rekindled the hope for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the southern part of the country.\n\nYari, a two-time Governor of Zamfara State, had indicated his interest to run for the office of the National Chairman of the APC.\n\nHe had after the completion of his two-term in office as governor in 2019, decided to retire to the Senate Chamber of the National Assembly like most governors do by contesting a senatorial seat.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court judgment which nullified all the elections won by the APC in the state truncated his ambition to retire to the red chamber.\n\nYari is believed to be highly competent and experienced with wide contacts as a former governor and former Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nHowever, his alleged high-handedness in the running of affairs of the APC, while he held sway as the governor of Zamfara State, which ultimately led to the loss of the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic (PDP) is said to be working against his ambition to lead the ruling party.\n\nSimilarly, the emerging political supremacy battle in the state, where he has locked horns with the newly defected governor Bello Matawale is going to be a major setback in his bid to lead the party at the national level.\n\nAPC members have also cited Yari\u2019s alleged consistent intransigence to the resolutions of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee on the leadership of the party in Zamfara State as his albatross.\n\nAlso, his case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged mismanagement of public funds running into billions of Naira, has become a sort of a moral burden on his neck.\n\nAl-Makura is another political heavyweight in the race for the position of the National Chairman of APC.\n\nHe enjoys the advantage of being a former Governor of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) extraction and a serving Senator.\n\nSources within the ruling party said Al-Makura is one of the aspirants to watch due to the strong support he enjoys from the governor of his home state, Mr. Abdullahi Sule, who had publicly declared support for him.\n\nHowever, his recent invitation by the EFCC over alleged mismanagement of multi-billion naira while he held sway as the Governor of Nasarawa State is an obstacle that could ruin his ambition.\n\nParty sources said if the damning evidence presented against him by the petitioners from his home state is anything to go by, then the former governor may as well bid his ambition farewell as it is unlikely that the APC and especially President Muhammadu Buhari would accept anything short of a clean slate from the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nAnother former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, representing Nasarawa West senatorial district is also in the race.\n\nAdamu is also a very competent and experienced politician and first civilian governor of the state.\n\nA former minister and secretary of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Adamu is as influential as any politician could aspire to be, and has been on the corridors of power for decades.\n\nHowever, sources in the APC said his old age is counting against him.\n\nAdamu also has to deal with the opposition at the home front as the governor of the state, Sule has thrown his weight publicly behind Al-Makura, Adamu\u2019s fiercest political rival in the state.\n\nAnother aspirant for the office of the Chairman of APC, Sheriff is an experienced political heavyweight and fighter, who led the PDP during its crisis.\n\nSheriff was elected as a Senator in 1999 on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP).\n\nIn 2003, he defeated the sitting governor, Mala Kachalla, at the party primaries, and won the election on the platform of All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). It was the APP that changed its name to ANPP.\n\nSheriff was re-elected as governor in 2007.\n\nHe is a founding member of the APC but he defected to the PDP in 2014.\n\nHe later became the national chairman of the PDP after the party lost the 2015 elections. His leadership was however marred by crisis and the party became factionalised.\n\nThe Supreme Court later declared the other factional leader and former Governor of Kaduna State, Mr. Ahmed Makarfi, as the authentic chairman of the PDP. In April 2018, Sheriff returned to the APC.\n\nNo doubt, the former governor of Borno State is a crafty and dogged politician with a very deep pocket to prosecute any political ambition.\n\nHowever, committed APC chieftains are said to be uncomfortable with the alleged \u2018spoiler\u2019 role he played in the PDP and his inconsistency, which makes him switch political parties at will.\n\nHe was also alleged to have sponsored the terrorist group, Boko Haram Islamic sect, an allegation he had dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d.\n\nShettima is another two-term Governor of Borno State and former Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nThese positions he had held may count in his favour as he contests for the chairmanship of the ruling party.\n\nHis cordial relationship with the governor of his home state, Prof. Babagana Zulum, is also an added advantage to his efforts to realise his ambition to lead the APC.\n\nHowever, whatever achievements he recorded as Borno State governor were blighted by the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nMustapha is not only the youngest of the contenders but one of the two in the race who is neither an incumbent nor a former governor or Senator.\n\nNevertheless, the Kwara-born businessman brings to the table a robust experience in party administration that spanned decades.\n\nHe also has a vast political network within the progressive fold.\n\nHe is also a well-known long-term political ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, starting from his days in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to the days of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), where he served as a Deputy National Chairman under the Tony Momoh-led NWC of the party between 2011 and 2013.\n\nMustapha also has grassroots influence in his home state and a rich network of friends across the country.\n\nMustapha is said to be running a campaign that appeals to both the young and the old members of the party.\n\nCodenamed B.R.I.D.G.E.S, Mustapha\u2019s campaign seeks a return to the party\u2019s founding ideals of progressivism and internal democracy.\n\nHowever, he has never held a top political position like governor or member of the National Assembly and this may count against him.\n\nA former governor of Benue State under the platform of the PDP, Akume is also said to be in the race.\n\nAkume, a two-term governor was re-elected Senator for Benue North-West in the April 2011 elections, on the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nSince he lost the senatorial seat to Senator Emmanuel Yisa Order-Jev of the PDP in the 2019 general election, his political fortunes at the home front have nosedived considerably and this led to a total loss of control of the state by the APC.\n\nBut his experience as a two-term governor, and his current position as a serving minister in President Buhari\u2019s cabinet, will boost his chances.\n\nHowever, APC sources have described him as being \u2018docile\u2019 and \u2018laid back\u2019 in his campaign for the party\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nGoje is also said to be in the APC chairmanship race but his alleged ambition has remained in the realm of speculation.\n\nThe former Gombe State governor and Senator representing Gombe Central had after his victory in the 2019 general election, formally declared that he would not seek any political office again.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "With the rising cases of abductions in secondary and tertiary institutions across the country, the federal government and the authorities in the states are doing little or nothing to protect students from further attacks by marauding gunmen. Students have been left on their own to protect themselves while trying to get education. JOHNSON AGADA and DYEPKAZAH SHIBAYAN visited a number of schools in the north-central zone of the country and found out that some students and lecturers live in fear \u2014 without any effort on the part of the authorities to protect them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was horrifying when over 200 girls were abducted from a secondary school in Chibok, Borno, in 2014 by Boko Haram insurgents. This sparked so much outrage around the world and many called for their release using #BringBackOurGirls on social media and hoped that the incident will mark the end of such an occurrence.\n\nFour years later in 2018, 113 students were taken from Dapchi, Yobe state, by gunmen to the horror of many again.\n\nThe year 2020 marked the beginning of constant abductions of students in the country as seen in the cases of Mahuta and Kankara \u2013 just weeks apart \u2014 in Katsina state. From that point, the abduction of students seemingly became a norm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, many students are still in captivity despite millions of naira being spent as ransom to get them out of the claws of bandits.\n\nAlthough some students were freed after ransom was paid, others have not been so lucky. Some of them have been reportedly killed as is in the case of Greenfield University students in Kaduna state \u2014 leaving many to wonder what the real intentions of these bandits are.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies say they are doing their best to keep the situation under check but their efforts do not seem to stop the incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith hundreds of students abducted and millions of naira paid as ransom, there appears to be nothing sufficient on the ground to show the government\u2019s determination to keep students safe.\n\nMany students have been forced to stay at home over security concerns.\n\nBOKO HARAM IN NIGER BUT SCHOOLS NOT PROTECTED\n\nIn April 2021, Abubakar Bello, governor of Niger, said Boko Haram hoisted its flag in Kaure, Shiroro LGA of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBello said over 3,000 internally-displaced persons (IDPs) from Shiroro and Munya LGAs were taking refuge in Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) Primary School, Minna, as a result of the activities of the insurgents.\n\nBefore the incident, the state was the epicentre of kidnapping in the north-central after bandits abducted 27 students from Kagara and a number of of travellers in a another incident.\n\nWhen TheCable visited the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger state, weeks after the incursion of insurgents into the state, business was as usual.\n\nPeople, students and business owners walked into both campuses of the university without any security checks. The main campus which is home to a majority of the students of the institution is not fenced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA bit of a perimeter fence could be seen in front of the institution but not at the back.\n\nHostels, both male and female, are located at the back of the school and on the margins of a not-so-dense vegetation where about 13 hamlets \u2014 not so far from each other \u2014 could be seen.\n\nA 400-level student who identified himself as Samuel said he does not live on the campus because he does not feel safe there.\n\n\u201cI am more comfortable off campus than inside the school. The school opens up into the forest. Students were tensed following the news of Boko Haram in Shiroro LGA,\u201d Samuel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201dBehind the hostel environment at Gidan Kwano Campus, Federal University of Technology, Minna. Behind the campus are settlements and students began seeing flashlights so there has been tension.\n\n\u201cIt has been business as usual. There has not been an increase in security.\u201d\n\nNo officer was seen at a police post located not too far from the main gate of the institution.\n\n\u2018CAMPUS IS A HUNTING FIELD\u2019\n\nCorroborating Samuel\u2019s position, Patricia Kure, a 300-level student of FUT, said they have been left to protect themselves from harm.\n\nKure said bushes close to the hostels on the main campus have been used by locals around the school to hunt game, which makes many of them afraid because of gunshots.\n\n\u201cWe are fending for ourselves. If those guys [insurgents] are going to come into this school the [students] can\u2019t escape. The security is very poor. There is no security.\n\n\u201cThe rumored gunshots we usually hear is reportedly for game \u2014 there are wild animals here. That is around the Gidan Kwano hostel area.\u201d\n\nAt the Bosso campus of FUT Minna, the security personnel were not armed and there were no checks for those entering the school either on foot or in a vehicle.\n\nSTAFF QUARTERS DESERTED AFTER ATTACK IN PLATEAU\n\nJust like FUT, Minna, the Federal College of Land Resource, Kuru, Plateau state, is not completely fenced.\n\nAlthough when TheCable visited the institution, the school was not in session but TheCable observed that the staff quarters was deserted with just a few soldiers at the back of the school.\n\nIt was learnt that many members of staff abandoned their residences after a devastating attack on the institution in September 2020.\n\n\u201cBandits killed a security man and his colleague was fatally injured on 2nd of September, 2020. Since then the staff quarters has been empty,\u201d a lecturer who did not want to be named said.\n\nOne of the soldiers stationed at the back of the school said they have been owed allowances despite their effort in protecting the institution.\n\nIn April 2021, three students of the institution were abducted by gunmen but they were released after three days in captivity. The police claimed that no ransom was paid.\n\n\u2018WE ARE ROBBED FREQUENTLY\u2019\n\nAt the Federal University of Technology, Makurdi, Benue state, TheCable observed that there were no security precautions put in place to check criminals from going into the school despite high cases of robbery in the area.\n\nThere is also no presence of police officers despite a recent kidnapping incident at the institution.\n\nSuewese Ejembi, a student of the institution, said she does not feel safe at the school.\n\n\u201cThere are robbery incidents, like phone snatching at night, and burglary cases. There is the total absence of security personnel off campus environment and there is no police post,\u201d Ejeh said.\n\n\u201cThe security personnel guarding the school are not armed. I don\u2019t feel safe in the school environment at all, we are just on our own.\n\n\u201cWe only get to see soldiers at night going to villages at the back of the school when there are attacks in those villages.\u201d\n\nPOLICE POST NOT FUNCTIONAL\n\nJust like the University of Agriculture in Makurdi, the Federal Polytechnic, Nasarawa in Nasarawa state, does not have a functional police post.\n\nA student who identified himself as James said many students do not feel safe on campus.\n\n\u201cThere is only one police station at St Kizito and that is about one kilometre away. The police station near the market isn\u2019t operational. We have cases of robbery,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cWe do not feel safe. We get robbed all the time. We have a security man who is old and can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nTheCable observed that the polytechnic is not completely walled and parts of the school open to a dense vegetation at the back \u2014 where some herders graze their livestock.\n\nAt the University of Abuja main campus, TheCable observed that the school is not walled but plans are underway to put up a perimeter fence.\n\nFranka Bulus, a final year student, said there have been efforts by the institution\u2019s management to secure the school, adding that many students feel safe on campus.\n\n\u201cThe permanent site is not fenced all round because the school is very big but the vice-chancellor has started fencing,\u201d Bulus said.\n\n\u201cYes a new law has been implemented for all students to always wear their ID cards around their necks else they will be expelled and people are always vigilant.\u201d\n\nTheCable observed that students walked into campus without security checks.\n\nWhen TheCable visited the University of Jos, Plateau, students had been asked to stay at home over security concerns in the state.\n\nJust like the University in Abuja, the main campus opens up to a thick bush at the back. It was observed that there were no security checks on both campuses of the institution.\n\nSTUDENTS RISK ABDUCTION IN NORTH-CENTRAL\n\nAlthough there are no official figures of students in the country, over 80,000 students in the north-central zone risk abduction, TheCable learnt from some sources.\n\nSources in the University of Jos, the University of Agriculture, Makurdi, and FUT, Minna, put the figures of students \u2014 undergraduate and postgraduate \u2014 in these institutions at 33,000, 13,000 and 20,000 respectively.\n\nBen Goong, media director at the federal ministry of education, neither answered calls nor replied to a text message sent to him on what the federal government is doing to secure tertiary institutions across the country.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation. Published materials are not views of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "title": "Meet Julaya, a startup solving payment frictions for the World Bank in Ivory Coast",
          "text": "Grace Kouassi, an Ivorian construction retailer, goes through a lot of hassle when she has to pay employees their monthly salaries.\n\nHer challenges are not due to a lack of cash but stem from how best to disburse the funds. She has three options \u2013 use bank transfers, mobile money, or cash. In countries like Nigeria or South Africa, the first option, to an extent, is effective for business payments but not in Ivory Coast.\n\nCharges on real-time gross settlement (RTGS) interbank transfers can be as high as CFA17,000 ($30) and most times, the transfers take longer than expected \u2013 up to three days instead of a few hours \u2013 while also being prone to transaction issues.\n\nMany small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), like Kouassi\u2019s, grapple with costly and sluggish interbank transfers when paying employees or suppliers. They also can\u2019t use mobile money due to its limitations and are often forced to rely on inefficient and dangerous cash-based transactions.\n\nThese challenges are not limited to SMBs; they affect government institutions and even multilateral development organizations.\n\nEnter, Julaya.\n\nDigitising trade payments\n\nFounded in 2018, Julaya is a startup that provides businesses in Ivory Coast with mobile-based digital accounts to make money transfers.\n\nBefore launching Julaya, co-founders Mathias L\u00e9opoldie and Charles Talbot worked on the expansion of LemonWay \u2013 a marketplace payment solution \u2013 into Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nIt was during their time at the France-based fintech firm they were introduced to the world of mobile money in francophone Africa and realised how businesses in Ivory Coast could reach a huge unbanked population faster via mobile phones.\n\nIn a country with around 26 million people, only 20% own bank accounts. But thanks to mobile money, millions of Ivorians can access basic financial services today.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Ivory Coast is one of the largest mobile money markets in francophone West Africa and continental Africa. Up to 75% of the adult population own a mobile money account.\n\nJulaya\u2019s platform.\n\nTackling the fragmentation problem\n\nA 2015 decision by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to allow nonbanks operate mobile money set the stage for a transformation in Ivory Coast\u2019s financial inclusion story.\n\nMobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by all three of the country\u2019s mobile network operators (Orange, MTN, and MOOV) who share the market with two over-the-counter institutions, CelPaid and Qash Services.\n\nThere have been significant investments in digital finance products, building agent networks, and pushing for acceptance. Presently, Ivory Coast has the highest mobile money penetration rate in West Africa.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, mobile money transactions in the country rose from CFA4.5 trillion ($7.7 billion) to CFA6.3 trillion ($10.8 billion).\n\nBut like other markets in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is no interoperability between mobile money providers in the country. This means users can\u2019t send money to wallets from another provider.\n\nGiven the penetration of mobile money, some businesses make use of agents to initiate payments, with cash, to digital wallets. But using this method for payroll disbursements can be a hellish task.\n\nKouassi, for example, has 24 employees who have mobile money accounts from five different operators. Whenever she opts for this option, there are always accounting and reconciliation problems to deal with after.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nJulaya solves this pain point by helping businesses disburse money electronically to several mobile money and mobile banking wallets via a single platform, faster than wire transfers or cash transactions.\n\nThe startup works with telecom operators and other mobile money players, integrating their APIs into its platform and allowing businesses make easy transfers to digital wallets from different providers.\n\nBy reducing the reliance on cash, Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting processes and improve operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cAn understanding of these payment challenges in the market was essential to developing a solution people would use,\u201d L\u00e9opoldie told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity was to translate a payments ecosystem designed for B2C payments (mobile money) into a solution that could offer a better corporate end-user experience of mobile transacting.\u201d\n\nToday, Julaya has onboarded eight mobile money services through direct connections with telcos and aggregators.\n\nThough the platform is built for business payments, it focuses on lower-value transactions. This is because the foundation of its product is designed for small payments, hence, higher-value transactions are not always feasible.\n\nStill, the startup has been able to onboard a wide range of clients, from SMBs to large corporates and government institutions \u2013 including the World Bank, Ivory Coast\u2019s Ministry of Education, and pan-African e-commerce company, Jumia.\n\nAs of July, it processed over $2 million monthly for 50 customers.\n\nThe Julaya team.\n\nJulaya\u2019s expansion plans\n\nJulaya plans to deepen its market penetration in Ivory Coast, in the face of competition from the market-dominant telecom operators, other mobile money players, and banks. There are also plans to roll out the service across the francophone West Africa region, where seven countries, including Ivory Coast, share a single currency and central bank.\n\nThe expansion will be driven by a $2 million pre-Series A secured by the startup recently and announced late July. Julaya had previously raised $250,000 in 2018 and $550,000 in 2019, both of which were from angel investors.\n\nPresently, Julaya operates out of two offices; its R&D and IT teams in Paris and a regional office in Abidjan. Across both locations, it employs 16 people.\n\nFinding the right talent to join the team is one of the major problems the startup is facing, according to L\u00e9opoldie, in addition to unreliable APIs from telecoms and a lack of trust in digitised payments, which makes customer acquisition costs high.\n\nBut Julaya\u2019s ambitions remain undeterred, with its expansion on schedule to start with an entry into Senegal this year.\n\nSome of the new investment will also be deployed into product development \u2013 specifically the addition of new digital wallets to Julaya\u2019s disbursement offering and possibly integrating the platform with its customers\u2019 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Explained: Can the Nigerian government really spy on your WhatsApp messages?",
          "text": "Barely a month after blocking access to Twitter, the Nigerian government allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for a \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d.\n\nAn interception solution for WhatsApp would allow an external party (the government, in this case) to access, monitor, or block communications (calls and chats) carried out by users via the app.\n\nThe move is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigeria from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms. However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToronto-headquartered shared mobility startup, Plentywaka has announced a $1.2 million seed raise a month after completing the Techstars Toronto Accelerator program in July 2021.\n\nOn the back of this raise, the company also revealed that it had acquired Ghanaian mobility startup, Stabus as it looks to expand its African operations, starting with West Africa.\n\nThe round was led by Toronto-based VC, The Xchange. Other participants include China-based VC, SOSV; US-based VC, Shock Ventures; Nigeria-based Argentil Capital Ventures; and Nigeria-based ODBA & Co Ventures. Techstars Toronto also made a follow-on investment.\n\nRounding off the list are several angel investors from Canada, the US, and Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlentywaka was founded in 2019 by Onyeka Akumah, Johnny Ena, John Shaibu, and Afolabi Oluseyi. The company has two primary offerings, Travelwaka \u2014 for inter-state travel \u2014 and Dailywaka \u2014 for intra-state travel \u2014 via its app. It provides ride-sharing services to its users on-demand.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funding to scale its operations. This brings Plentywaka\u2019s total raise to $1.62 million.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on a call, Akumah expanding on this, said, \u201cOne of the major kickers was to get into Ghana, which we are already doing. It\u2019s to pretty much grow our numbers. By Monday (August 23, 2021), we would have reached about 480,000 rides, which puts us at about half a million completed rides.\n\n\u201cAlso, Dailywaka is growing really fast, but for Travelwaka, with the partners we\u2019ve got, we want to expand it to more cities. The future for us here at Plentywaka is where we would expand our services beyond Ghana into six African countries within the next two years.\u201d\n\nThe move to Ghana appears to have been in the works for quite a while. Acquiring Stabus is a part of Plentywaka\u2019s plans to become one of the largest shared mobility startups in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlentywaka and Stabus (now Plentywaka Ghana) team members. Source: Supplied\n\nAn easy decision to make, Akumah tells Techpoint, \u201cWe found an entrepreneur in Isidore who is a brilliant person who has been doing something similar to what we are doing, with similar visions, with similar goals.\u201d\n\nCo-founded in 2019 by Isidore Kpotufe, Stabus has moved over 100,000 people in Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital city. Its services include daily bus-stop to bus-stop transportation and providing staff bus solutions for multinationals like MTN Ghana and GB Foods.\n\nThe company\u2019s vision is similar to Plentywaka\u2019s, solving one of Africa\u2019s biggest transportation challenges, traffic congestion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Akumah, on September 16th, 2021, Stabus would launch as Plentywaka Ghana, with Kpotufe becoming Country Manager while retaining team members from the Ghanian startup.\n\nCurrently, Travelwaka operates in 21 cities in Nigeria, a result of several partnerships with bus operators in the country, such as the recently announced collaboration with interstate bus company, GUO Transport.\n\nAkumah says Plentywaka has currently onboarded 963 vehicles with about 100,000 unique users and a team just shy of 50 members \u2014 a factor he says has been integral to the company\u2019s success.\n\nWhen Plentywaka joined the Techstars Accelerator programme, the platform said the company would solve a problem that affects major cities, even in developed cities.\n\nAnd while Akumah says there might be a possibility of a Canada expansion in future, it\u2019s currently focused on moving into East and West African cities, despite being headquartered in Toronto.\n\nSpeaking on the raise, Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Techstars Toronto, said, \u201cWe are incredibly excited by our investment in Plentywaka. Techstars is a huge believer in the future of Africa and a proud supporter of African entrepreneurs. Onyeka is a two-time Techstars founder, which deepens this relationship further.\u201d\n\nTodd Finch, Founder and Managing Partner of The Xchange, had this to say, \u201cThe Xchange is on a mission to fuel purpose-driven founders with the capital and resources they need to realise the world-changing potential of their ideas.\n\n\u201cGiven Onyeka\u2019s proven track record, his team\u2019s undeniable thirst for making an impact, and Plentywaka\u2019s impressive growth, we knew this was an opportunity we wanted to invest in.\u201d\n\nPer the company\u2019s statement, in line with its expansion plans, it will be looking for the right kind of partners and investors to join the black and yellow movement \u2014 Plentywaka\u2019s colours \u2014 to provide the best-in-class transportation service connecting cities and communities with technology across Africa.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, the company is planning its Series A round, to ramp up its plans to scale operations.",

Founded in 2018 by Kim Hodgson (CEO) CashBackApp assists fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in building customer loyalty by allowing them to earn cash back on their everyday purchases through M-Pesa.\n\nInterestingly, it claims to have gained significant traction, with its user base increasing at a monthly compounded rate of 38% in the first half of 2021 to 45,000 downloads.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the startup has signed up major international FMCGs as customers, including CocaCola, Colgate, and Ajab, while its retailer network consists of eight large multi-chain retailers, including Khetias, Eastmatt, Mulleys, and Jamaa.\n\nMore plans? CashBackApp plans to reach more than one million shoppers by December 2021.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook finally made a good virtual reality app. Read.\n\nWhy the power of our collective voices will change the world.

          "title": "11 critical questions on the leaked NITDA bill; a tussle for more power?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year, the Nigerian tech industry has been the recipient of seemingly damaging policies, from the crypto ban to NIPOST\u2019s reversed regulations to the Lagos okada ban.\n\nA few days ago, rumours of an intended amendment to the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007 circulated on social media.\n\nIt finally gained traction when a link to the leaked bill was released, and several screenshots of supposedly alarming provisions began to float all over social media.\n\nWhat is in the leaked bill, and how different is it from the subsisting Act? Does NITDA have new powers? Who does this affect? We took a fine-tooth comb through its hairs and found some surprising information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is NITDA?\n\nNITDA is the agency tasked with creating a framework for the planning, research, development, standardisation, application, coordination, monitoring, evaluation and regulation of Information Technology practices in Nigeria.\n\nThe Agency is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Digital Economy. As part of its mandate, it provides regulations regarding data protection, registration of domination names, IT Clearance, among others.\n\nWhat powers does NITDA have?\n\nUnder the current Act, the Agency itself has no powers. On the other hand, NITDA\u2019s Board is clothed with five powers, none containing any hint of these new powers.\n\nWhat the Agency does have is a host of functions which increase from 14 to 24 in the leaked bill.\n\nIf this proposed bill is anything to go by, NITDA appears to be gearing up for a more active, albeit forceful reign.\n\nHas the bill been passed?\n\nNo, it has not. The National Assembly (NASS) has not received the bill as of yet.\n\nHowever, In March 2021, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the Agency\u2019s DG, \u201cpresented a proposal for the realignment of \u2018NITDA Act 2007\u2019 with the tenets and ideals of Digital Economy Policy of the current administration, and indeed, the 4th Industrial Revolution before the relevant committees of both chambers of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nWho leaked the NITDA bill?\n\nThere is currently no accurate information as to who leaked the bill. It began circulating on social media, and conversations sprung up in dismay, anger, and disappointment. So far, attention has been paid to the provisions in Sections 6, 13, 20, and 27 as they seem to question the importance of ease of doing business to the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Index 2020 \u2014 measures the ease of doing business through a comparative assessment of regulatory environments.\n\nWhat does the new bill contain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first glance at the leaked bill reveals several new sections, one of which \u2014 Section 6 \u2014is proposing new powers be given to the Agency.\n\nAmong these worrying provisions is a new subsection which gives the Agency the power to \u201center premises, inspect, seize, seal, detain and impose administrative sanctions on erring persons and companies who contravene any provision of the Act subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nNITDA will also have the power to \u201cfix licencing and authorisation charges, collect fees and penalties as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions under this Act.\u201d\n\nThis bill would also introduce a new regime of licences and penalties.\n\nSection 20 would give NITDA power to issue regulations regarding licences and authorisations for operators in the information technology and digital economy sector \u2014 which the Agency is to determine.\n\nThese licences are classified into three categories: Product Licence, Service Provider Licence, and Platform Provider Licence.\n\nWith the number of licence regimes which Nigerian startups currently have to subscribe to, is there a possibility that there would be duplicity?\n\nAway from licences, we come to penalties.\n\nWhat are these penalties, and who do they affect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from\n\nIf the leaked bill is to be believed, Section 13 says individuals found guilty of failing to comply with NITDA\u2019s rules would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) or face one-year imprisonment, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, corporate bodies, if found guilty, would be liable to a fine of not less than \u20a630 million ($72,832.21). The \u2018principal officers\u2019 of the companies might also be imprisoned for two years or more.\n\nReferencing its proposed search powers, individuals or corporations that contravene the provision would be fined not less than \u20a63 million ($7,283.82) and \u20a630 million ($72,832.21), respectively. Prison terms range from a year to two for individuals and members within a corporate body.\n\nSurprisingly, there seems to be an error on offences with no penalties under the Act. In a preceding subsection, the leaked bill proposes a fine not exceeding \u20a630,000,000 ($72,832.21).\n\nOn the same subject, in a directly succeeding paragraph, it then provides for fines not exceeding \u20a63,000,000 ($7,283.82) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,138.87) for first and subsequent offenders, respectively.\n\nWhat else is different in this bill?\n\nA good starting point is the penalties placed on offences. Under the current Act, first-time offenders are liable to at least one year imprisonment or a fine of \u20a6200,000 ($485.55), or both.\n\nFor subsequent offenders they are liable to at least two years imprisonment, a fine of \u20a6500,000 ($1,213.89), or both.\n\nThe leaked bill suggests an expansion of these penalties and no longer requires NITDA to collaborate with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to enforce its regulations.\n\nOther new provisions include a broadened section on the functions of the Minister of Information and Digital Economy, new sections on administrative redress processes, rulemaking processes, and the establishment of a Digital Infrastructure and Service Provision Company \u2014 Galaxy Backbone\n\nWhat is Galaxy Backbone?\n\nA look at the provision regarding the establishment of Galaxy Backbone reveals an interesting angle. One of the members of the Board is to be a representative of the Jigawa State Government.\n\nA look at Galaxy Backbone\u2019s website reveals no connection to the Jigawa State Government. It is an information technology and shared service provider wholly owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nAfter a more in-depth search, the name Galaxy Information Technology and Telecommunication (GITT) cropped up. The company, which provides a wide range of communication services, was founded by Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, former Governor of Jigawa State, in 2001.\n\nWhile the names are somewhat similar, there is seemingly no connection between the two companies.\n\nHowever, several tweets by different Twitter users suggest a relationship between the two companies.\n\nGalaxy Information Technology and Telecommunications Limited started as a Dutse-based ISP in 2001 and morphed into what is now Galaxy Backbone. The Federal Government and Jigawa State Government co-owned 51% while private stakeholders held 49%.\n\n\n\n*waltzes back to vacation mode* \u2014 'Gb\u00e9nga \u1e62\u1eb9\u0300san (@gbengasesan) August 16, 2021\n\nTech-wise, Jigawa state was ahead of its time. As far back as the early 2000s, Dutse, Hadejia and parts of Kazaure had metro Wifi.\n\n\n\nThey setup Galaxy Backbone, which OBJ was so impressed with that he told them they HAD to sell it to the FG (and in return, FG will host and use\u2026 \u2014 SuperSanusi (@supersanusi) August 17, 2021\n\nWhat is the National Information Technology Development Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Image: Current Act, 2nd Image: Leaked Bill\n\nA major sticking point has been the NITDA fund as contained in the leaked bill.\n\nThe fund is to be financed in four specific ways. The first is a levy of 1% of the profit before tax of companies and enterprises contained in the Third Schedule of the bill with an annual turnover of \u20a6100,000,000 ($242,777.37) and above, which is tax-deductible.\n\nOther avenues include gifts, endowments, and grants-in-aid.\n\nIntriguingly, this is unchanged from the current Act. Several questions arise. Is NITDA implementing it currently? Are there issues with the current execution strategy? How does it plan to implement this?\n\nThe expanded powers of the Agency in Section 6 and the provision of penalties \u2014 not currently contained in the NITDA Act \u2014 suggest an answer.\n\nOther provisions such as the need for a pre-action notice, tax exemptions, and limitations to suits, uses of the fund remain unchanged\n\nWhich companies will pay the levy?\n\nUnder the current Act, the companies are:\n\nGSM Service Providers and all Telecommunications companies;\n\nCyber Companies and Internet Provider;\n\nPensions Managers and pension-related companies\n\nBanks and other Financial Institution\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nAs contained in the leaked bill, these companies are\n\nmobile and fixed telecommunications companies,\n\ninformation technology, e-commerce companies,\n\ndigital platform operators and providers,\n\nforeign digital platforms targeting the Nigerian market,\n\npensions managers and pension-related companies,\n\nbanks, financial institutions and companies providing financial services using information technology tools,\n\ninsurance companies, and\n\nsuch other companies and enterprises as determined by regulations from time to time by the Agency.\n\nEssentially, startups or companies in the above list will be affected if this bill is passed into law.\n\nThe way forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese draconian rules, if this exact bill is eventually submitted and passed into law by the National Assembly, could spell hard times for the Nigerian startup scene.\n\nThis is coming at a time when the Nigerian Startup Bill \u2014 a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the Presidency to harness the potential of the digital economy through co-created regulations \u2014 is being prepared to be placed before NASS.\n\nAs contained on the website, \u201cThe Bill will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s laws and regulations are friendly, clear, planned and work for the tech ecosystem. This, we believe, will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for growth, attraction and protection of investment in tech startups.\u201d\n\nIs there a possibility that the Nigerian Startup Bill might be declared dead on arrival if the leaked NITDA bill is published?\n\nIn July 2021, Flutterwave announced the appointment of a Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. Chances are, we may see this trend continue, with startups and companies taking pre-emptive steps to engage the government.",

          "title": "New oil law holds out possibilities, opportunities for real estate investors",
          "text": "Possibilities and opportunities for investors in the Nigerian real estate sector are part of the many benefits the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) signed recently by President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to bring to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn addition to paving way for Nigeria to attract private capital into the operations of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which will be commercialised in the next six months, it is expected too that the new oil law will expand the corporation\u2019s ability to enter into new deals.\n\nThe law will help NNPC to finance its projects and bigger national ventures; it will also enable it to raise capital from financial institutions to fund projects and tackle funding shortfalls with joint ventures.\n\nFinancing projects or raising funds to fund projects means there will be an uptick in real estate activities, leading to the development of oil facilities. That would also mean fresh demand for both commercial and residential real estate, to serve as office space and residence for oil workers.\n\nBy the new law, it is seemingly possible that the commercial office market which, in the first half of this year, recorded its lowest transactions in five years may be well on its way to a rebound.\n\nThe slowdown in the residential and commercial real estate, particularly at the luxury and A-grade office space have been attributed to the challenges in the international oil market which led to many oil firms leaving the country with their staff who were major consumers of these real estate assets.\n\n\u201cThough I don\u2019t have all the details of the new law yet, one thing is sure. The new law will stimulate investment which means there will be an increase in business activities. While new oil firms are expected to come into the market, existing ones will be encouraged to expand the operation,\u201d Tokunbo Ajayi, MD/CEO, Propertygate Investment Company, said.\n\nAjayi explained that all these would translate to increased economic activities in which case people would be thinking of buying homes while new firms will be needing office space, shops or business premises. The result of all these would be increased demand for real estate.\n\nRead also: New oil law paves way for Nigeria to attract private capital\n\nHe pointed out however that all these would depend on how the NNPC commercialization is implemented. \u201cIt must give investors enough comfort for them to consider new investments,\u201d he said.\n\nFemi Akintunde sees the new law as the best thing to happen in the oil industry in 20 years, explaining that it holds a lot of possibilities for a country that derives 90 percent of its revenue from oil.\n\n\u201cThe unbundling or commercialization of the NNPC is the icing on the cake for the new law. But for all these to work out, the interests of the various stakeholders in the PIA have to be served. These include the government, IOCs, host communities, the public and environmental activists,\u201d Akintunde advised.\n\nHe affirmed that proper implementation of the NNPC commercialization would lead to an increase in economic activities, stressing that real estate would only benefit if there are economic activities that would increase people\u2019s disposable income.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there are three major problems that are slowing activities in the real estate sector. These are access to fund, low income and weak demand. If people\u2019s income improves, it will impact on demand for housing. Increased demand leads to an increase in the supply of housing products,\u201d he said.\n\nAkintunde hopes that the new law would lead to oil firms making investment decisions, adding that all the investments that had been in waiting due to lack of clarity in the oil industry law would now be revisited. He noted that Shell alone had over $30 billion investment plan but had to put it on hold.\n\nHe also hopes that more investment would be coming into the country and the service companies such as facilities managers, estate valuers, among others would benefit, leading to a boom in the real estate market.\n\n\u201cOffice space, residential and industrial real estate would be in demand. Expatriates will come and they will need luxury real estate in places like Lagos and Port Harcourt,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides industrial real estate which benefited from the Covid-19 lockdown and social distancing rules, both residential and commercial real estate have been struggling amid the crippling impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe office space market, particularly, has had its worst moment. In its first half (H1) 2021 office market viewpoint, Broll Properties says the market recorded less than 200 square metres in new leases.\n\nThe report adds that foot traffic at office buildings fell under 30 percent in the period, but hopes that the rate is expected to pick up as tenants such as Cisco and Google begin to roll out policies for staff resumption to the office.\n\n\u201cKey trends in the office market in the period include new leases signed remain subdued, its worst level in over five years; vacancy levels rise overall, however, the pace of increase is not uniform across different buildings,\u201d Bolaji Edu, Broll Nigeria CEO, disclosed.\n\nHe noted that both asking and achieved rents were falling as the nature of transaction activity was limited, making the market tenant-friendly. Eduadded that the market was yet to bottom out as more corporates continued to revaluate and aspire to optimise their operations in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 The National Union of Nigerian Associations in Italy (NUNAI) has described as false the allegations against the Italian government by Mr Osaze Ero, a former commissioner in Edo.\n\nThe union made the description in a statement signed by its Welfare Officer, Micheal Oputteh and made available to NAN on Saturday,\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ero, a one-time Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Diaspora Affairs in Edo, is accusing Italian officials of wrongful detention when in 2019 he embarked on a trip to Germany.\n\nHe had said, during a visit to Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman/CEO of NIDCOM that he was tried under a corrupt Italian Justice System and was racially abused just like many Nigerians.\n\nHowever, Oputteh, as the welfare officer of the Italy-based Nigerian union is denying the former commissioner\u2019s claims, saying that Nigerians were never targeted by the Italian government.\n\nHe said the Italian government had provided great working, living, and friendly environment for Nigerians legally living in Italy.\n\nOputteh noted that Italy would, just like any other country, arrest, try, and detain in prison anyone found guilty of flouting its laws by engaging in criminal activities.\n\nAccording to him, the more than 100,000 Nigerians living in Italy are neither being victimised nor unlawfully detained by Italian authorities.\n\n\u201cI listened to the interview granted by Osaze Osemwegio Ero, during his visit to Dabiri-Erewa.\n\n\u201cAnd as a Nigerian living in Italy and an elected official (Welfare Officer) of the National Union of Nigerian Associations in Italy, I am duty-bound to tell the truth so that the public will know what is happening in Italy.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Italian authorities have never targeted Nigerians for any harassment, nor are they engaged in racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cPrecisely, we have more than 100,000 Nigerians living legally in Italy.\n\n\u201cThese people are engaged in legitimate businesses and some have even integrated into the Italian society and married Italians while Italians also married Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSome have also acquired their citizenship. How come the same Italy gave Nigerians good abode in Italy. Why are the more than 100,000 thousand Nigerians not arrested and put in prisons?\n\n\u201cIt is also surprising that Mr Ero is accusing the Italian Judiciary of corruption and manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe same corrupt judiciary tried him and set him free for lack of enough evidence. It means the judiciary is very fair and transparent.\n\n\u201cEro should leave Nigerians in Italy in peace and should not use his political ambition to cause problems for Nigerians in Italy or between the governments of Nigeria and Italy.\n\n\u201cThe lives of Nigerians in Italy put together are greater than his political ambition. I personally know the extent to which I went in collaboration with the embassy when he was in detention, trying to secure a house for him.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that he is claiming he did not receive any assistance from the government of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOputteh who noted that Italy is a sovereign state wondered whether Ero\u2019s utterances and actions were intended to mislead Nigeria onto a diplomatic collision course with Italy.\n\nH advised the former Edo commissioner to seek redress through legal means if he felt so strongly about the way and manner he was treated by the Italian officials.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Ero is to approach his issue through legal means to seek redress rather than engaging in media propaganda.\n\n\u201cThe law is the law anywhere in the world. Nobody is above the law,\u201d Oputteh said.\n\n...",

God has specially favoured me to see one, two, three Olu of Warri and I don\u2019t want to see four,\u201d he prayed.\n\nObasanjo prayed for a peaceful and long reign of the Olu, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to see fourth Olu,\u201d having witnessed three crowned in my lifetime.\n\n\u201cCongratulations. May your reign be long, peaceful, bring unity and prosperity to Itsekiri. May your reign contribute to the development, unity and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\nThe former president further reassured Atuwatse III of his legitimacy from God and should diligently perform the task God has entrusted to him.\n\n\u201cThe position you occupy is given to you by God but with your people surrounding you. You\u2019ll be offending God not to perform the task He has given to you.\n\n\u201cAll our kings are as good as the Queen of England. In the British days, they\u2019ll say \u201cYour Highness.\u201d What\u2019s highness? They don\u2019t want anybody to share the title with them, we reject that. So, you\u2019re \u201cYour Majesty.\n\n\u201cBut the title carries a lot of responsibilities. Two things must guide you: one, don\u2019t shun the experience and advice of elders. It\u2019s useful. Experience is wisdom. Make use of the experience of people around you.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the title \u201cHis Majesty\u201d carries a lot of responsibilities, the three-time former Nigerian leader charge the the Olu of Warri to not despise the counsel and experience of elders, even as he strives for a closer relationship with God in all his affairs.\n\nObasanjo who was accompanied to the altar by Okowa and his deputy, Kingsley Otuaro, promised not to be far from the king, saying \u201cand if there\u2019s any reason to summon me, use your majestic power to do so.\u201d\n\nPresident Obasanjo, in concluding, declared that \u201cItsekiri land has got a new dawn and it will happen and continue to happen.\u201d\n\nDignitaries from all walks of life, home and abroad, including, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, former governors James Ibori, Emmanuel Uduaghan, Senator James Manager, presidents of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) and Nigeria Football Association (NBA), Olu Akpata and Amaju Pinnick, Speaker, Delta Assembly, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori as well as notable clerics were at the thanksgiving service.\n\nThey admonished the Olu to quickly effect the process of healing wounds and uniting the entire Itsekiri Nation.\n\nEarlier, Senator Okowa, who regretted and apologised for his absence at the Coronation ceremony of the Olu of Warri on Saturday, urged the Olu to extend the olive branch to any aggrieved Itsekiri.\n\n\u201cI wish it were possible to be at the two events yesterday. But my spirit was with you. I know you\u2019re a man of peace and God has chosen to ascend the throne this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware a lot of healing process is ongoing. It\u2019s time for healing; ensure the entirety of the kingdom comes together.\n\n\u201cWhether stubborn or not, extend the olive branch to them. You have a lot of work to do in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford any distraction at home so that the larger nation will have your presence in that nation-building.\n\n\u201cYour reign will truly bring peace and development. God has prepared you for this time. God\u2019s presence be with you,\u201d Okowa prayed.\n\nIn his message at the Thanksgiving Service, Guest Speaker, Apostle Tomi Arayomi, said God ordained the Atuwatse III for the throne.\n\nHe narrated how God mysteriously instructed him to come to Nigeria in 2018 to restore the \u201cstolen\u201d crown for the new king, said it was a divine arrangement for him to rule at this time, adding that God was willing to partner with people who were willing to partner with the spirit of God to develop nations.\n\nOgiame Atuwatse III was crowned as the 21st Olu of Warri on Saturday at Ode-Itsekiri, ancestral home of the Itsekiri, in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\n...",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: Who are the Taliban, the group that resisted America\u2019s military to retake Afghanistan?",
          "text": "A shocked world and a humiliated America have now come to terms with the Taliban\u2019s return to power in Afghanistan, two decades after they were toppled.\n\nThe handwriting was always on the wall. But few envisaged the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban to happen as fast as it did, and with as little resistance.\n\nEven when the commander of the US-led mission in Afghanistan, Austin Miller, a general, warned in June that the country could be on the path to a catastrophic civil war, which he said should be a \u201cconcern for the world,\u201d after America withdraws its forces, not many foresaw the Taliban sacking so swiftly the government that the world superpower had propped up in Kabul since 2001 when American forces had just as swiftly overrun the country.\n\nBut subsequent concentration of power in Kabul and the exclusion of important power brokers in rural Afghanistan availed Taliban fighters space and time to regroup.\n\nNo match for U.S. military might, they leveraged the local legitimacy they enjoyed to cling on till the foreign troops got tired and withdrew. Many Afghans are sympathetic to the Taliban because they delivered swift justice compared to the corrupt American-backed government in Kabul.\n\nFrom obscurity to relevance\n\nAfghanistan has a history of resistance to foreign occupation, including of the British Empire thrice, hence its moniker of \u201cgraveyard of empires.\u201d\n\nBy 1979, armed opposition was threatening to topple the Afghans communist regime which was backed by the Soviets who had invaded the country.\n\nBuoyed by America\u2019s backing, mujahedeen rebels resisted the Russian forces until the Soviets yielded in 1989.\n\nIn his memoirs, Robert Gates, an ex-CIA official and defence secretary under Presidents Bush and Obama, recalled that there was an agreement in a staff meeting in March 1979 for the U.S. to provide funds for the mujahedeen to buy weapons.\n\nReeking under the loss of men, money and might, the USSR pulled out its troops from Afghanistan. Two years later, the USSR disintegrated into 15 independent countries.\n\nEfforts by the Soviet-installed President, Mohammad Najibullah, to broker some deals were blocked by Washington which continued to arm the rebels.\n\nThe Soviet forces\u2019 withdrawal from Afghanistan sparked infighting among the rebels who then had arms in abundance in their hands .\n\nIn stepped the Taliban, meaning \u201cstudents\u201d in the Pashto language.\n\nBy September 1995, they overthrew President Burhanuddin Rabbani, one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahedeen that had resisted Soviet occupation.\n\nBy 1998, they were in charge of almost 90 per cent of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban regime quickly consolidated power by restoring peace and order, fighting corruption and lawlessness and introducing economic reforms, all within their own interpretation of Islamic laws.\n\nLargely of Pashtun stock, the group emerged from areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan, and were students of seminaries initially sponsored by Saudi Arabia to spread the theology of Sunni Islam.\n\nThey enforced a hardline interpretation of the Sharia law, the jurisprudence of Islam, sparking opposition from the West.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen the 9/11 attacks happened in which terrorists said to be Al-Qaeda fighters bombed high-profile targets in the U.S., triggering the largest manhunt in the world.\n\nAl-Qaeda shield\n\nSeeking to capture Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the September 11, 2001, attacks, whom it claimed the Taliban were harbouring, the U.S. and its Nato and regional allies invaded Afghanistan in October that year.\n\nBy December, the Taliban government had been toppled, forcing the group\u2019s then leader, Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, to be on the run.\n\nA major onslaught would ensue for two decades as the foreign troops sought to crush the Taliban whose members clung on to remote areas to sustain their relevance.\n\nTheir ouster paved the way for foreign powers to establish Western-type democratic government and constitution, and to train new Afghan forces.\n\nRecognition of rights, particularly of women, soared. Girls school enrollment increased from 9,000 in 1999 to 2.4 million in 2003. Currently, enrolment is around 3.5 million, and around a third of students at public and private universities are women.\n\nAllegedly backed by neighbouring Pakistan, however, the Taliban continued to regroup.\n\nIn 2018, the group entered a peace deal with the U.S., and by February 2020, both sides struck an agreement in Doha that committed the U.S. to withdrawal and the Taliban to stop attacks on U.S. forces.\n\nBackdoor funding apart, the group drew the majority of its funds from illegal drug sales. Ninety per cent of the world\u2019s opium population is from Afghanistan. According to the UN security council, the Taliban make up to $1.5 billion a year from opium trade.\n\nThe years of peace negotiation with the U.S. offered them time to reorganise. More than at any other time since their ouster, the group gained numerical strength with up to 85,000 full time fighters, according to recent Nato estimates.\n\nAs allied forces withdrew from Afghanistan, the Taliban did not wait to see them out. They seized vast swathes of the Afghan territory, installed the government they lost two decades ago, forcing the Afghan government to flee.\n\nHuman and material costs\n\nSince the war against the Taliban began in 2001, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and Brown University estimated that the U.S. and allied troops have lost 3,586 soldiers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThe same source estimated 75,971 Afghan security forces to have died or been injured. Civilian casualties which include workers, journalists and contractors were put at 78,314. Opposition fighters\u2019 loss, including the Taliban, stood at 84,191.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), nearly 111,000 civilians have been killed or injured since it began systematically recording civilian casualties in 2009.\n\nLast year, more than 400,000 people were displaced by the conflict. Around five million people have fled since 2012, making Afghanistan the third largest displaced population in the world, according to the UN\u2019s human rights agency.\n\nReconstruction activities in Afghanistan have gulped nearly $143.27 billion. More than half of that ($88.32 billion) went to training the Afghan security forces, the army and police force.\n\nGovernance and development also gulped about $36 billion while smaller amounts were also allocated for anti-drug efforts and for humanitarian aid.\n\nAn October 2020 report submitted to the U.S. Congress estimated that about $19 billion was lost to fraud, abuse and waste between May 2009 and December 2019.\n\nWhile Washington continues to double down on its costly withdrawal, uncertainty and fear pervade Afghanistan and the world\u2019s political atmosphere, marking, as the Economist put it, yet another failure of America in military planning, intelligence and nation building.",

Young generation, please listen to me: all these things you plug in your ear will block your way forward. It is designed by the devil to block your way forward.\n\n\u201cNo time to hear from God. Many have never heard anything from God. They even plug it in anywhere, on the streets: noise, noise, noise! Zero access to divine guidance. Noise in the morning, afternoon, night.\n\n\u201cThere is a situation in South Korea, I saw it in one publication. Now 10,000 churches were said to close down within 10 years, an average of 1,000 churches per year. Why? Children, young people will sit down in church (with earphones): don\u2019t hear nothing Sir. In fact, service will end, we were told and they won\u2019t know until they look around and see there is no one around. It is as terrible as that. The devil wants to destroy the faith of the future generation. Very soon, he wants to wipe away the Bible hard copy from your hand so you can be browsing nonsense even in church\u2026\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t do that here because CCU (Crowd Control Unit) is here, you plug something in your ears, while you are in church? Never. Go somewhere else. Never, you sit down tight, hear the Word or stay on the road. Life is about discipline. I started understanding the Word from the age of 16. I was responding accordingly.\u201d",

Israel Akanji said God would help free the 63 others still in captivity.\n\nThe parents\u2019 joy however knew no bound Sunday when they were reunited with their children, kidnapped from their boarding school in the early hours of July 5, 2021.\n\nBlueprint recalled that the bandits broke into the school located at Damishi along the Kaduna \u2013 Kachia highway, Chikun local government area of the state and whisked away 121 students.\n\nThe kidnappers released 28 of the students, Sunday, July 25 after receiving N50 million ransom and later released few others on health ground, while some escaped on their own leaving 78 students in captivity.\n\nThe bandits thereafter made fresh demand of N80 million ransom to release the remaining 78 students in captivity.\n\nAlthough Blueprint reliably gathered that ransom was paid for release of the 15 students, the amount could not be established as at the time of this report.\n\nHanding over the children to their parents at the Baptist secretariat along Ahmadu Bello way, Rev. Akanji said they expected the bandits to release all the remaining 78 students.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to God for the release of these 15 children. Although the number is smaller than what we expected, because we had 78 out there; they have given us 15, that means 63 to come, but in everything, God said we should give thanks and we are grateful for what He has done. And we are trusting that the same God will help us to receive the remaining 63.\n\n\u201cWe have great hope in God and we will keep praying and keep asking God for help. We do not know why they did not release all the children; we were really expecting all the children, but these are the ones we have. So, we are giving thanks to God and we are trusting God that others too will come,\u201d Akanji said.\n\nHe, however, declined to comment on the ransom paid.\n\nThe students were conveyed to the Baptist Secretariat in an 18-seater bus, few minutes after many of their parents were brought in two similar vehicles.\n\nThe parents could not hide their joy, as they sang praises and shed tears on sighting their children who had spent 46 days in the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nThough they had been refreshed before being officially handed over to their parents, the students were all looking traumatic and in need of treatment and care.",

          "text": "Muslim communities in the crisis ridden Jos North local government area of Plateau state Sunday rose from a stakeholders\u2019 meeting with a promise to give necessary cover to churches in their areas.\n\nThey said the decision became imperative as stakeholders had realised some politicians were using religion to achieve their selfish ends.\n\nThe meeting was an aftermath of the killing of some Muslim faithful of Ondo state origin returning from Bauchi state where they had gone to attend an Islamic function, but attacked in Jos by some miscreants.\n\nAlso last Friday, the state\u2019s deputy governor, Mr Sunny Tyoden, led a high-power delegation to Ondo state where they handed over 49 survivors of the attack, and also sought for forgiveness from the Ondo people.\n\nResolutions\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 after the peace parley at the conference hall of Jos Central Mosque, the meeting called for peace and resolved to support efforts at achieving a return to normalcy in the state.\n\nThe meeting was at the instance of Jasawa Community Development Association (JCDA), an umbrella body of Hausa and Fulani Muslims of Jos.\n\nAddressing journalists after the parley, JCDA National President Shehu Ibrahim Masallah said this became necessary following the recent killing of some 28 travellers around Gada-biyu-Rukuba Road.\n\nIn a nine-point communiqu\u00e9 read by its national secretary, Alhaji Aminu Mato, the meeting agreed to protect all churches in the area.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have resolved to protect all Churches within Muslim communities. It is our resolve that nobody should, should destroy, burn or vandalise any church within us. This is so because we have realized that some politicians are using this kind of opportunity to achieve their surreptitious objectives knowing full well that religion is very sensitive.\n\n\u201cThis will go a long way to preventing further occurrence of crisis in Jos and its environs. We have equally resolved that vigilante groups within our domains will work and assist the security agencies to ensure peace and harmony within Jos and its environs and agreed that anybody caught attacking innocent citizens or causing trouble will be handed over to the security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further urged the state government to be proactive before a crisis escalates in any community and ensure justice for the aggrieved.\n\n\u201cWe urge parents to ensure adequate and proper monitoring of their children and ward\u2019s. We all resolved that the issues of school dropouts amongst our youths and jobless amongst them will be looked into aim at reducing the menace of criminality.\n\n\u201cWe will liaise with the necessary agency of government to also ensure rehabilitation of those youths that engaged themselves into illicit drugs,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nIn attendance at the parley were religious and community leaders within and outside Jos, as well as other stakeholders.\n\nOgun evacuates students\n\nIn a related development, amidst the rising threat to lives and property in Plateau state, the Ogun state government has evacuated University of Jos (UNIJOS) students who are of the state origin.\n\nThe killing of scores of travellers, including four students with many injured in Jos by suspected hoodlums, forced UNIJOS management to suspend the ongoing second-semester examination for the 2019/2020 academic session.\n\nSpecial Assistant to the governor on students\u2019 affairs, Mr Azeez Adeyemi announced this while speaking to journalists in Abeokuta Sunday.\n\nAdeyemi said Governor Dapo Abiodun provided five buses and security escorts to ensure the safe return of the stranded students.\n\nHe said the evacuation was carried out in conjunction with relevant stakeholders including security agencies, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and the National Association of Ogun State Students (NAOSS).\n\n\u201cIn line with the policy of Governor Dapo Abiodun on the protection of lives and property of every Ogun State indigene, the Governor has ordered the immediate evacuation of all the indigenes of the State studying in the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis followed the crisis which erupted as a result of the killings of four students of the institution.\n\n\u201cWe have provided five buses and security escorts to bring our children back home safely.\n\n\u201cNo indigene of this State will be allowed to suffer or be abandoned irrespective of their political or religious affiliation. They are Ogun people and it is our duty to ensure their safety,\u201d Adeyemi said.\n\nAlso speaking, NAOSS President Oluwagbemileke Ogunrombi said the state officials had already evacuated about 80 students and some corps members who are indigenes of the state from the trouble areas.\n\n\u201cWe requested for two buses, but the state government magnanimously released five buses, not only buses but with a military escort. So, the students have been evacuated and taken to a safe haven.\n\n\u201cAs at last time, we spoke with the team, about 80 students have been evacuated. Then, they said some Corp members are also joining them,\u201d Ogunrombi said.\n\nASUU decries attacks\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Jos chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has condemned the attacks and killing of students and members of the university community during most civil unrests in Jos.\n\nUNIJOS ASUU Chairman Lazarus Maigoro said this in a statement Sunday in Jos.\n\nMaigoro described the recent attacks on students of university as \u201csad and unfortunate.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cASUU in University of Jos, with serious concern and sadness wishes to bring to the notice of the general public the recent developments in and around Jos and how it has impacted negatively on the University.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered untold damages in relation to loss of lives and property, in addition to the regular suspension of academic activities each time there is a security breach in Jos and as a union, we have tried to understand how the university community is always at the receiving end of each crisis in Jos.\n\n\u201cIn spite of all the provocations, we have continued to offer community service to all, irrespective of religion, culture and tribe; the university administration has over the years made overtures to host communities in terms of undergraduate admissions and staff employment, yet our students and staff are killed at the slightest provocation, however far the epicentre of the crisis from the institution.\n\n\u201cThe University is a citadel of learning which houses various categories of people regardless of ethnic and religious affiliations, as such, should be spared anytime there is breach of security in other parts of Jos.\n\nHe also expressed worry that the suspension of academic activities and closure of the school would pose a serious setback to the students\u2019 academic sojourn.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing examinations have been suspended and the students are asked to go home thereby abruptly destabilising the semester and the academic session in general.\n\n\u201cThis equally means longer stay in school for the students in the face of current harsh economic realities in the country.\n\n\u201dAs teachers, our hearts go out to these students, particularly families who lost their loved ones.\n\n\u201cThey are equally our children and no parent will want his child killed because he went to the University to acquire a degree.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU leader called on the government and security agencies to intensify efforts and end the circle of violence in the state, particularly in the rural areas.\n\nMaigoro further appealed to the government to deploy more security personnel to the university to ensure the safety of its staff and students.\n\nHe advised the government to compensate all those who suffered any loss during the recent attacks and ensure justice for the dead.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Acting Vice Chancellor of University, Gray Ejikeme, had confirmed the killing of a student of the university in the recent attacks in Jos, adding that investigations were ongoing to ascertain the real state of things.\n\nMr Ejikeme, however, promised to make available detailed information on the number of students killed and those injured during the recent attacks.

Iwuogo, New Life Evangelical Church, Bishop Stanford Nworgu, Praise Centre Cathedral and Rev. Dr. Victor Isiodu, Balm of Gilead Ministries.\n\nDr. Asinobi said, \u201cA typical proscription of OSU involved a traditional religious ritual where the DIALA community gathered at the village shrine, with the Chief Priest of the land presiding over the ritual. The OSU was tied, as the Chief Priest pronounced over his head, such curses that were supposed to come upon the land. A sacrifice was made on the community altar. And the OSU was dedicated to the deity that ruled over the shrine.\n\n\u201cIt was believed that the OSU would bear any evil burden that was supposed to come upon the land and the people; whether sickness, disease or death. By virtue of the ritual, the OSU was regarded as one that was cursed, abominable, and untouchable. Hence he was ostracized.\n\n\u201cThe UME was believed to have been cursed to die prematurely by the gods. Over the generations, it has been established however that the people tagged UME were simply individuals with a history of sickle cell in their family background.\n\n\u201cThe OHU was of the slave class made up mostly of people used as collateral for debts and individuals sold by their kinsmen. A lot of the OHU were captured in battles, whereas some were drawn from the OSU class.\u201d",

However, conflict becomes negative, destructive and costly to all when they become violent. It is our utmost conviction that peace is possible with a non-violent approach to dispute resolution. We, therefore, call on all parties to dispute across the country to deploy the use of dialogue and a non-violent approach to resolving their conflict.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all Nigerians to use the upcoming Peace Day celebration on 21 September 2021 to spread compassion, kindness, tolerance, hope, love, and peace for sustained recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and violent conflict.

          "title": "APC crisis: Will leadership hammer fall on 100 members who sue party?",
          "text": "ome aggrieved members numbering one hundred approached a federal high court sitting in Abuja to seek the dissolution of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Co\u00f1vention Planning Committee, CECPC, headed by Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe plaintiffs, through their lawyer, Barr. Samuel E. Irabor, asked the court to declare the 13-man caretaker committee illegal, and to nullify all activities so far presided over by it including the recently conducted ward congresses.\n\nThey contended that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs added that the headship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC constitution. It is also the contention of the plaintiffs that Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer oath of office to Mr Buni as caretaker chairman of the party. The plaintiffs argued that only the National Working Committee of the party could constitute a Caretaker Committee as provided under Article 13(4)(xvi) of the APC Constitution. Listed as co-defendant in the originating summon registered as Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, are the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and others.\n\nThe row over the status of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has for a while threatened the fragile peace within the ruling party. While disgruntled factions of the APC hold that there is a flaw in having Governor Mai Mala Buni remain as Chairman of the CECPC, others argue that there is no constitutional breach in having a serving governor lead the party at the moment. In a recent communique aimed at making clear its position on the controversy over the legality of the CECPC and that of its chairman, the APC stated that \u201con both issues, we will state the position and decision of the Supreme Court only. The decision here is the majority judgment of the Supreme Court which is now the Law. \u201cThe decision and judgment was read and concurred to by the justices who were in the majority. Any other statements in their various additional contributions by the justices complement the lead judgment. \u201cIt is therefore right to say that the issues and ratio in the lead judgment reflect the views of the majority. The minority judgment, although important as it is, is not the judgment of the court.\u201d The statement further notes that the Supreme Court in its judgment affirmed the legality of the CECPC, adding: \u201cthe court stated that the NEC under Article 13 (3) IV of the APC constitution has power to create, elect and appoint a committee and endow it with powers and functions. It drew a parallel with Article 33(3) of PDP constitution (2012) with similar powers granted to its National Convention which in turn appointed a National Caretaker in 2016, which the Supreme Court ruled legal in Sheriff VS PDP. \u201cOn the status of the Acting National Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Supreme Court held that he was appointed only in acting capacity, on temporary basis to carry out and fill in the seat of the National Chairman, pending the election of new officers. \u201cThe Apex Court also held that Mai Mala Buni\u2019s position as Acting Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is not contrary to the provision of Section 183 of the CFRN because the appointment, ad-hoc, is on a temporary basis which is not akin to Executive office or paid employment as envisaged by Section 183 of the CFRN.\u201d \ufffc The latest court suit came barely three weeks after a minority judgement of the Supreme court which questioned the eligibility of Mai Mala Buni, as the CECPC chairman triggered flurry of legal opinions, interpretations as well as implications of the judgement on the fortune of the ruling party in future elections.\n\nInterestingly, the plaintiffs action is in defiance of a directive issued by the National Executive Committee of the APC at its emergency meeting of December 8, 2020, in which it directed all members who have instituted one case or the other against the party in a law court to withdraw such and further warned others not to sue the party until all internal mechanism for conflict resolution are completely exhausted.\n\nThe APC leadership vowed to dish out maximum punishment to offenders in accordance with its constitutional provisions. Similarly, the national leadership of the party, in a statement issued on July 30, 2021, had threatened to wield the big stick on any of its members who takes the party to court without first exhausting all available internal mechanism of reconciliation to address their grievances.\n\nRecall that APC NEC had at its December 8 emergency meeting expelled former National Vice Chairman, South-South, Hilliard Eta, for challenging the dissolution of the immediate past National Working Committee, NWC, by the National Executive Committee, NEC, in the courts against party directives.\n\nChief Etta, and some other members of the dissolved National Working Committee, NWC, of the party, had approached a Federal High Court in Abuja, to ask for the nullification of the June 25, 2020 APC NEC meeting which dissolved the NWC. The questions being asked now is whether or not the 100 aggrieved members who defied the party\u2019s warning to institute a court suit would suffer a similar fate to Chief Hilliard Eta.\n\nAnswering questions from journalists in this regard on behalf of the party, APC chieftain, Chief Patrick Obahiagbon, alluded that that the party\u2019s constitution dictated that punishment for erring members can only be initiated from the ward, local government to the State before the national headquarters can sanction such members.\n\nObahiagbon said, \u201cThe APC has party Constitution and the party Constitution is quite clear on issues that has to do with the necessity of members of this political party to exhaust all domestic remedies. As to what the sanction would be, for any member of this party who has fallen short of respecting the party Constitution not only with regards to taking the CECPC to Court. The constitutional provision to the effect that disciplinary sanctions will have to start from the Ward of such members. Disciplinary actions will have to go to the local government, states before it comes to the National Secretariat.\n\n\u201cSo the CECPC will not by itself discipline any member of the political party that has not been (sanctioned) from Ward, local government, state and to National Secretariat. But all I can tell you is that when all such activities have passed through the democratic rigours and get to the National Secretariat, this CECPC under the able leadership of Governor Mai-Mala Buni, he will not shake in his responsibility, his constitutional onus probandi, will dispense justice to all manners of men without fear or favour and in a very transparent modus.\u201d\n\nThe only organ of the party that can unilaterally sanction erring members is the NEC which is presently unconstituted as it was dissolved at its last meeting.\n\nAs it stands, no one knows what will become the fate of these members or what the reaction of the party to the litigation would be.\n\nThe party, however, seem unperturbed or distracted by the development as it has directed that its local government congress go ahead as scheduled.\n\nIn a notice of guidelines and schedule of events released by the party last week, the APC fixed its local government congress for Saturday 4th September, 2021 while sales of forms has commenced with immediate effect.\n\nAccording to the notice signed by the CECPC Secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, Purchase of Forms for Ward, Local Government/Area Councils and State Congresses will hold between18th August to 28th August, 2021.",

          "text": "As permutations for the 2023 presidential race continues to gather momentum, posters with pictures of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje have flooded the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe posters were sponsored by a support ground called the \u201cOsinbajo-Ganduje Alliance\u201d.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cOsinbajo-Ganduje Alliance (OGA), For Better Nigeria OGA Na Master.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by Messrs Oluleke Mose and Bello Adamu Mohammed of the Osinbajo Ganduje Alliance support group says, \u201cVice President Osinbajo and Governor Ganduje have both offered the most plausible solutions to ending the security crisis occasioned by the farmers-herders crisis across the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if power rotates to the South, Osinbajo is best placed to unite, heal and inspire our great nation. We also firmly believe that Ganduje\u2019s antecedents as Governor of Kano make him the perfect Northern vice presidential candidate to Osinbajo; one who will advance and protect the interests of a Northern Nigeria plagued by poverty and insecurity.\u201d\n\nMost political pundits believe that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is quietly nursing a Presidential ambition, while Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, whose tenure ends in 2023, has publicly expressed his support for a Southern President.\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) i s most likely to zone its Presidential candidate to the South of Nigeria, after eight years of Buhari and based on a purported gentleman understanding reached between the founding members of APC in 2014.\n\nKano in North West Nigeria is renowned for its politics, and boasts of the largest voter turn-out figures in Nigeria. Lagos, Osinbajo\u2019s political alma mater, has arguably become the hub of political influence and activity in the South of Nigeria.\n\nAs concerns around Tinubu\u2019s health and age have grown, there is mounting opposition to Tinubu\u2019s ambition within the APC; and more politicians and pundits in the South are beginning to talk and play up the prospects of younger Turks within the APC like Prof. Osinbajo, Gov. Kayode Fayemi and the former governor of Lagos Babatunde Fashola (SAN).\n\nGov. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, a PhD holder in Public Administration who served then defeated his erstwhile political godfather Gov. Rabiu Kwankwaso, belongs to a moderate group in the APC and North that believes the next President of Nigeria should come from the South.\n\nPairing a sitting Vice President from the second largest voting zone in Nigeria with a governor from the largest voting zone in the country could be a political masterstroke for votes in 2023.\n\nHowever, as the APC appears to have conceded that power rotates to the south, and as consensus grows around Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy, it is anticipated that the contest for the Vice presidential slot amongst Northern APC politicians will start to assume center stage.\n\nDespite the fact that the campaign posters are very conspicuous in public places near the presidential villa, no official reactions have come from the Vice President\u2019s or Governor\u2019s offices.",

          "title": "Resident Doctors Still On Strike Due To Lack Of Trust \u2013 NMA",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA deep distrust of the Federal Government\u2019s ability to implement its promises is behind the prolonged strike of resident doctors across the country, the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe problem we face is that when agreements are signed, everybody goes to sleep,\u201d NMA President, Innocent Ujah, said during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cSo there is this distrust among workers. And this is not good for the country; because we expect that those who work for our President should be truthful, honest and should comply with the agreement.\u201d\n\nThere were indications that the three-week-old strike would soon be called off after the doctors, under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) met with Federal Government representatives in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nThe meeting was brokered, in part by the NMA, which is the parent body of all doctors in the country.\n\nBut the resident doctors refused to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) produced at the end of the meeting, citing the government\u2019s decision to institute a court action over the strike.\n\nThe resident doctors also said the government must reverse its \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 policy.\n\n\u2018Impoverished\u2019 Doctors\n\nMeanwhile, a NARD spokesperson, Julian Ojebo, has said the resident doctors will not resume unless their benefits have been paid.\n\nOjebo, while speaking on Sunrise Daily, said resident doctors have been left \u2018impoverished\u2019 by the government\u2019s inability to meet its demands.\n\n\u201cWe are not on strike for added allowances; we are not on strike for any other thing,\u201d Ojebo said. \u201cWe are on strike for our normal due salaries that you have not paid from January to July.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cWe are talking about salary shortfalls that you have not paid from 2014 to 2016. We are talking about monies you have not paid for our medical residency training program. These are the issues on the table, and these issues have not been resolved.\u201d\n\nHe noted that signing MoUs was an academic exercise that does nothing to address the doctors\u2019 demands.\n\n\u201cPayment of our benefits are the only actionable plans that can actually make us sign any memorandum of agreement of terms,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOther than these, I don\u2019t think we are being fair.\u201d\n\nA recurring problem\n\nThe resident doctors had earlier embarked on a strike in April.\n\nThe strike was suspended within ten days after the doctors met with Federal Government representatives and an agreement was signed for implementation.\n\nBut nothing was done to implement the agreement, NARD has said, prompting the resumption of the strike action.\n\n\u201cTwenty-one days of strike action in this country is unacceptable,\u201d the NMA chief Ujah said on Monday. \u201cBut the problem is that some people are not doing their work.\n\n\u201cThis strike is avoidable. In April, we were able to convince our colleagues to suspend the action, and nothing happened anymore.\n\n\u201cThey gave a period of notice to government, again nothing happened.\n\n\u201cThe issue is about distrust. So government has to implement at least some of the demands.\n\n\u201cIf the government does its own bit, there is no reason why resident doctors should not go back to work. They are not happy that when issues are raised, implementation becomes a problem.\u201d",

          "text": "The Taliban warned on Monday there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d if the United States and its allies extend the presence of troops in Afghanistan beyond next week, as chaos continued to overwhelm Kabul airport.\n\nThe rapid fall of the country to the hardliners last weekend shocked Western nations, coming just two weeks before an August 31 deadline for all troops to fully withdraw from the country.\n\nInstead, thousands of soldiers have poured back in to manage the frantic airlifting of foreigners and Afghans \u2014 many who fear reprisals for working with Western nations \u2014 out of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIf the US or UK were to seek additional time to continue evacuations \u2014 the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,\u201d Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Sky News on Monday.\n\nStaying beyond the agreed deadline would be \u201cextending occupation\u201d, he added.\n\nThe rush to leave Kabul has sparked harrowing scenes and killed at least eight people, some crushed to death while at least one person died after falling from a moving plane.\n\nOne Afghan was killed and three others were injured in a dawn firefight on Monday that according to the German military erupted between Afghan guards and unknown assailants.\n\nGerman and American troops \u201cparticipated in further exchange of fire\u201d, the German army said in a statement.\n\nThe Taliban, infamous for an ultra-strict interpretation of sharia law during their initial 1996-2001 rule, have repeatedly vowed a softer version this time.\n\n\u2013 Impossible to meet deadline \u2013\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s victory ended two decades of war, as they took advantage of US President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to exit the country and end America\u2019s longest war.\n\nBiden has insisted he wants to end the US military presence and the airlifts by August 31.\n\nBut with the European Union and Britain saying it would be impossible to get everyone out by then, Biden is under pressure to extend the deadline.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Sunday, Biden said talks were under way to explore the possibility of extending the deadline.\n\nHe also acknowledged the tragic scenes at the airport, which have also included babies and children being passed to soldiers over razor-wire fences and men clinging to the outside of departing planes.\n\nBut he said they were part of the cost of departure.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss and heartbreaking images you see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Peace and calm\u2019 \u2013\n\nBiden spoke after the Taliban, who have been holding talks with elders and politicians to set up a government, slammed the evacuation.\n\n\u201cAmerica, with all its power and facilities\u2026 has failed to bring order to the airport,\u201d Taliban official Amir Khan Mutaqi said.\n\n\u201cThere is peace and calm all over the country, but there is chaos only at Kabul airport.\u201d\n\nIn the streets of the capital, the Taliban have indeed enforced a calm of a kind, with their armed forces patrolling the streets and manning checkpoints.\n\nVisually, they have also been looking to stamp their authority, ensuring the tri-coloured national flag is replaced with their white banner.\n\nAt a roadside in Kabul at the weekend, young men sold Taliban flags, which bear in black text the Muslim proclamation of faith and the regime\u2019s formal name: \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to spread the flag of the Islamic Emirate throughout Afghanistan,\u201d said seller Ahmad Shakib, who studies economics at university.\n\n\u2013 Resistance \u2013\n\nOutside of Kabul, there have been flickers of resistance against the Taliban.\n\nSome ex-government troops have gathered in the Panjshir Valley, north of the capital \u2014 long known as an anti-Taliban bastion.\n\nThe Taliban said Monday their fighters had surrounded resistance forces holed up in the valley, but were looking to negotiate rather than take the fight to them.\n\nTaliban fighters \u201care stationed near Panjshir\u201d, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted, saying they had the area surrounded on three sides.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Emirate is trying to resolve this issue peacefully,\u201d he added.\n\nThe announcement follows scattered reports of clashes overnight, with pro-Taliban social media accounts claiming gunmen were massing, and Afghanistan\u2019s former vice president Amrullah Saleh saying resistance forces were holding strong.\n\nOne of the leaders of the movement in Panjshir, named the National Resistance Front, is the son of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\nThe NRF is prepared for a \u201clong-term conflict\u201d but is also still seeking to negotiate with the Taliban about an inclusive government, its spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary told AFP in an interview on the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe conditions for a peace deal with the Taliban are decentralisation, a system that ensures social justice, equality, rights, and freedom for all,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Kenya\u2019s food import bill has increased to Sh103.34 billion ($940.20million), in six months, between January and June 2021.\n\nAccording to the import data gathered by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), the imported food, \u2013 including live farm animals for slaughter and breeding\u2014 and beverages hit a record high with pressure on household budgets that have already been damaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe figure shows Sh12.35 billion, or 13.57 percent, more than the Sh91 billion that was spent on food imports in a similar period last year, according to the data collated by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).\n\nThe expenditure on food imports in the half-year period is even higher than the Sh96.41 billion that was spent in the first half of 2017 when a biting drought hurt crop and fodder production hit \u2014triggering a national crisis that forced the Treasury to allow subsidies and waiver of import duties to smooth purchase of key food items such as maize, rice and milk powder from abroad.\n\nAnalysts attributed the latest rally in the food import bill to enhanced shipments of items such as grain and cereals to cover for production shortfalls locally on the back of late planting in the March-April-May main crop season and a weakened local currency against the US dollar, which meant importers paid more.\n\nData shows there has been enhanced importation of Kenya\u2019s major foods such as maize, unmilled wheat, and wheat flour and rice this year\u2014 contributing to the bigger import bill. For example, maize imports from Uganda and Tanzania in the first five months of the year jumped nearly two-fold to cross 1.38 million 90-kilogramme bags from 495,813 bags last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s data.\n\nWheat imports in the January-May 2021 period also increased 12.30 percent to 9.1 million 90-kg bags from 8.1 million bags last year, while rice volumes bumped 92.71 percent to 2.4 million 90-kg bags from nearly 1.25 million bags.\n\nA similar trend was witnessed in beans imports, which climbed to 287,031 bags in the review period from 215,014 bags, a 33.49 percent growth, the ministry\u2019s data shows.\n\nSeveral parts of the country have witnessed below average rainfall, with some areas suffering famine for much of this year.\n\nAuthorities have warned the country\u2019s food security situation could worsen in the North-Eastern region in the coming months should the upcoming short rainfall season (from October) record below-average performance.\n\n\u201cWe are already transitioning from the alert to alarm phase, and should the upcoming October rains also fail, then Kenya will be facing a very grave emergency indeed,\u201d Dr Stephen Jackson, the UN Resident Coordinator in Kenya, told a meeting to discuss the drought situation in Nairobi last week.\n\nThe impact of the expensive food imports is already being felt among Kenyan households amid rising inflation.\n\nFood inflation for July, for example, stood at 8.8 percent, the highest since May 2020 at the height of Covid shutdowns and travel restrictions, pushed by prices of cooking oil and vegetables, according to Central Bank of Kenya analysis.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

We leave here with a bad taste because we should have got more than a point after our brilliant first-half performance.\u201d\n\nSubstitute Vinicius Jr. put Real back on level terms after 70 minutes, outracing the Levante defence to a Casemiro through ball and calmly slotting past Levante keeper Aitor Fernandez to set up a tense finish to the match.\n\nHowever, Levante retook the lead soon after when Rober netted their third from a set piece with the hosts seeing a potential fourth goal glance off the far post without finding the back of the net.\n\nThe see-saw battle continued when Vinicius netted from a neat chip to make it 3-3 right before Aitor was shown straight red for a rash challenge on an onrushing Vinicius, who would have scored if not for the keeper\u2019s intervention.\n\nBut Vinicius again came to Real\u2019s rescue, levelling in the 85th minute with an audacious shot in off the post from a tight angle.\n\nThe Brazilian also netted in last week\u2019s 4-1 win at Alaves and is joint-top scorer with Atletico Madrid\u2019s Angel Correa on three goals from two games after adding some ice-cool finishing to his already impressive skill set.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t just been work on finishing, I\u2019ve been working on every aspect of my game to put in a performance like that,\u201d said Vinicius.\n\n\u201cWe are working a lot on escaping from our markers and Casemiro gave me a great pass for the first goal.

According to Sky Italy, Ronaldo requested to not start the match.\n\nBut after coming on, the 36-year-old forward thought he had headed his side to victory right at the death, only for VAR to rule Ronaldo to be offside.\n\nIn Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s first game in charge after returning for a second spell at the club, goals by Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado gave Juve a comfortable half time lead.\n\nA soft penalty conceded by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny six minutes after the break gifted Udinese a route back into the match before an even more calamitous error by the Pole let Gerard Deulofeu in to level in the 83rd minute.\n\nRonaldo, who came on for Alvaro Morata in the second half, then celebrated meeting Federico Chiesa\u2019s cross perfectly, only to see Juve\u2019s joy curtailed by VAR after a lengthy review.\n\nRonaldo had sat out of Juve\u2019s final preseason friendly in midweek, with the club saying the Portuguese was not fully fit.\n\nHe had been expected to start against Udinese but was left on the bench, with Juve vice-president Nedved saying before the game that fitness concerns had again kept him out and any talk that he had asked to miss the match to remain fit for a move away from the club was just speculation.\n\n\u201cRonaldo is feeling well; I had talked to him before the game, telling him he would start on the bench,\u201d Allegri told DAZN. \u201cHe made himself available, he did well when he entered the pitch.\u201d\n\nOn the pitch, Juve did not need last season\u2019s top goalscorer in Serie A, as Dybala put a frustrating campaign last term behind him with an instinctive finish early on before Cuadrado finished brilliantly to make it 2-0 inside 23 minutes.\n\nBut the visitors then conceded a soft penalty, which was converted by former Juve forward Roberto Pereyra, as the hosts came back into the contest.\n\nSzczesny then was far too casual on the ball, trying to flick it past Stefano Okaka, who made the block, and Deulofeu was on hand to sweep the ball into an empty net to stun the visitors.\n\nThe goal was initially ruled out for a foul on Szczesny, but VAR intervened to overturn the decision.\n\nThe video assistant referee\u2019s night was far from over. The cross from Chiesa, one of Italy\u2019s standout performers in their Euro 2020 success this summer, was perfect, while the leap from Ronaldo unstoppable.\n\nThe veteran looked to have snatched yet another victory for his side, but it was not meant to be as Juve, many experts\u2019 tip for the title this season, got off to a disappointing start.",
