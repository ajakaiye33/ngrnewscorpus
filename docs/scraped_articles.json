          "text": "Twenty years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, New York City, United States, the country is yet to fully heal from the wounds, according to reports\n\nIn commemoration and honour of the victims of this attack and the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Centre, American President, Joe Biden and his Vice, Kamala Harris, and other former presidents, including George Bush, held a memorial service at Shanksville, where the third plan had crashed when 40 passengers fought and overtook the plane from the hijackers.\n\nThe annual reading of names was concluded and President Biden laid a wreath at the Flight 93 National Memorial and silently reflected in front of the wall where the names of some 40 victims were posted, ABC News reported.\n\nAfter the memorial walk to greet the family members of the victims who were in attendance, Harris spoke at the memorial service, reflecting on the heroism of the passengers who fought the hijackers.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on Flight 93 told us then, and it still tells us so much about the courage of those on board who gave everything they possibly could, about the resolve of the first responders who risked everything and about the resilience of the American people.\n\n\u201cIn a time of outright terror, we turned toward each other. In the face of a stranger, we saw a neighbor and a friend. That time reminded us the significance and the strength of our unity as Americans, and that it is possible in America,\u201d she said.\n\nA former president, George W. Bush, in his part, warns Americans against domestic terrorism.\n\n\u201cHere, the intended targets became the instruments of rescue, and many who are now alive owe a vast, unconscious debt to the defiance displayed in the skies above this field.\n\n\u201cThey are children of the same foul spirit and it\u2019s our continuing duty to confront them.\n\n\u201cNothing that has followed, nothing, can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments. To you and the honored dead, our country is forever grateful,\u201d Bush said.\n\nThea Trinadad, who lost her father in the attacks and has signed up to read the victims\u2019 names at the ceremony at Ground Zero in New York said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard because you hoped that this would just be a different time and a different world. But sometimes history starts to repeat itself and not in the best of ways.\u201d\n\nIn a video released on Friday night, Biden mourned what he termed \u2018the ongoing losses\u2019 of 9/11 stressing that \u201cat our most vulnerable \u2026 unity is our greatest strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren have grown up without parents, and parents have suffered without children,\u201d Biden added.\n\nJust as memories of 9/11 are firmly embedded in the minds of most Americans old enough to recall the attacks, their historical importance far surpasses other events in people\u2019s lifetimes. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Striking doctors under the aegis of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors have dared the Federal Government to go ahead and arrest them all.\n\nThey gave the challenge while reacting to the threat by the National Industrial Court in Abuja which reportedly ruled that the doctors could be committed into prison if they fail to call off their ongoing strike.\n\nThe Vice President, NARD, Adejo Arome, in an interview with Sunday PUNCH on Friday said members of the association were not scared of the threat of arrest.\n\nHe urged the government to expand its prison since all members of the association will be arrested.\n\nHe also said since the last time Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo met with them through zoom, there has been no other meeting with the association.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince the last zoom meeting we had with the Vice President, there has not been any subsequent meeting.\n\n\u201cAs for the court notice, no one really cares. Let them expand their prison and arrest us all.\n\n\u201cIt has reached the point that no one cares about whatever happens. Let them meet our demands.\n\n\u201cWe will not go back to work unless our demands are met. This (court notice) won\u2019t make us change our mind.\u201d\n\nMembers of NARD had commenced nationwide industrial action on August 2.\n\nThe association declared the strike action on July 30 at its National Executive Council meeting with the theme \u2018The Nigerian doctor, an endangered species: grappling with a pandemic, poor workplace infrastructure and security threats.\u2019\n\nAnnouncing the action after the meeting held in Umuahia, Abia State, the National President, NARD, Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, had cited the failure of the Federal Government to implement the agreements it entered into with the union 113 days after it suspended the previous strike.\n\nThe Federal Government approached the National Industrial Court, Abuja which on August 23 ordered the striking resident doctors to suspend the action while delivering ruling on the government\u2019s ex parte application.\n\nJustice John Targema then adjourned the case to September 15.\n\nBut the resident doctors vowed to continue the strike until their demands are met, notwithstanding the court ruling.\n\nThe court has since written to the doctors, threatening to commit them to prison if they continue to disobey its ruling.\n\nThe court document, a copy of which is in the possession of our correspondent, was titled \u201cNotice of consequences of disobedience of court order\u201d and dated September 3, 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd this honourable court, having delivered its rulings, it is hereby ordered as described above. Further take notice that the enrolment order of the court is attached herewith. You will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison,\u201d the court read in part.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The National Assembly should have less than 100 members, including Abuja,\u201d the varsity don\u2019t said in his lecture.\n\nHowever, Gbajabiamila absolutely disagreed with the Vice-Chancellor, describing his perception as wrong.\n\nGbajabiamila who was represented as the Chairman of the occasion by Hon. Ibrahim Isiaka of Ifo/Ewekoro constituency, mentioned that the money budgeted for the National Assembly was two per cent of the total budget.\n\n\u201cNo one till today has actually sat down to go into research and define the meaning of legislators.\n\n\u201cThe money being spent on the national assembly is less than two per cent of the total budget of this country; but nobody, has ever looked at what is happening to the remaining 98 per cent. And when you say National Assembly, you are not talking about legislators, who are the lawmakers only. You are also talking about the National Assembly Commission, you are talking about everything, all encompassing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Speaker regretted that no one had ever sat down to go into research and define what the National Assembly actually means.\n\nHe charged Nigerians to change the perception that Nigeria runs the most expensive National Assembly in the world.",

          "text": "Twenty people have reportedly died of cholera, while 190 others were infected of the disease following the recent flood in Gololo town in Gamawa Local Government Area of Bauchi State.\n\nThough the Bauchi State Government denied the figure, saying that there was no death recorded in the community, while only five persons were infected of the disease.\n\nThe chairman of the Gololo Community Service, Honourable Abba Alhaji Gololo, revealed this to journalists, saying that cholera outbreak in the town was as a result of stagnant flood water in different parts of the community.\n\nThe chairman informed that since he was born, he had never witnessed such calamity, adding that from available record at the Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in the town, 20 people had died, while 190 others were infected.\n\nAccording to Gololo, who doubles as Sarkin Hausawan Gololo, \u201cSince the faithful day that water flooded his village, cholera outbreak has struck the town. Up till today it has not stopped.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you from the records in our Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC), a total of 190 people were infected with 20 deaths recorded already.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have 10 patients on admission at the PHC. We have reported the issue to authorities because the problems have been overwhelming.\n\n\u201cI am 50 years old. Throughout my life, I have never seen a calamity that befalls Gololo like the recent flood because here I am standing beside a mini stream which has accumulated flooded water and it is not a river.\n\n\u201cFor the past two weeks we have not witnessed rainfall but the water is still standing in the area.\u201d\n\nHe then appealed to the state government to assist in constructing drainages in the town to enable free flow of water whenever it rains in the town.\n\n\u201cWhat we are appealing to the state government and other well-meaning people from the state and beyond is to assist the people of Gololo with construction of drainage because drainage and culverts are the most pressing needs in Gololo to prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cCreate a passage for the water to pass because the water is coming from the bush when a river in a very far distance flooded to come into the town. We need food and other relief materials.\n\n\u201cWe believe that providing permanent solutions against such disaster is construction of drainage in Gololo,\u201d he said.\n\nAbba Gololo revealed that some people, including the state deputy governor, Senator Baba Tela, both member representing the area in the House of Representatives and state House of Assembly, the Chief of Staff, Government House, Bauchi, gave the community some financial supports.\n\n\u201cWe received some financial supports from some people, especially our member in the State House of Assembly, member of the House Representatives, the deputy governor of Bauchi, Chief of Staff Government House which we used for five days to save Gololo from extinction by flood.\n\n\u201cWe used the money to buy food for the youths who worked in different locations and everyday we gave each person N1,000 stipend. The community service committee has to borrow over N400, 000, apart from the over N1million donations to support the blockade exercise,\u201d Sarkin Hausawan Gololo said.\n\nHowever, in a swift reaction to the cholera outbreak in the town, the Executive Chairman, Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency (BSPHCDA), Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, denied that anyone died of the disease in Gololo.\n\nMohammed told DAILY POST in a telephone chat that only five persons were infected with the cholera in the community and they were currently receiving treatment in the health centre in the town, declaring that no one died of the disease in the town.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like 20 deaths and 190 infections recorded in the town. It is a mere rumour. Only five persons were infected and they are currently being treatment now,\u201d Dr Mohammed told DAILY POST.",

Dr. Sunday Ibrahim received and recorded them in turns as they trickled in under the watchful eyes of the APC, PDP agents, Security Officers from the Nigeria Police Command, The Department of Security Services, The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and journalists\u201d.\n\nHe said, the Returning Officer after deligently collating the various results consequently declared Comrade Yunana Markus Barde as the winner and returned him as duly elected Chairman last Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have the duly signed Kaduna State SIECOM Local Government Summary Result Sheets from the wards and the declaration of results of the election of the office of chairman as well as copies of results from the various wards of the local government area.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, want to use this opportunity to assert that contrary to falsehoods by SIECOM that the SEPTMBER 4TH Local Government Elections were inconclusive, that the said local elections were duly conducted, collected and collated and the results announced and winners declared by the duly appointed returning officer. There is no dispute as to who the winner of that election is.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reject her desire to unilaterally impose her whims and caprices on the esteemed Local Government electorates who have exercised their democratic franchise.\u201d",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum and a group in the South West, South-West Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG) have carpeted Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi over what they called his sympathy for bandits.\n\nThe South-West group also warned bandits and other criminal elements to steer clear of the region, or face the wrath of the group.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the Convener of the group and the Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams and the secretary, Alhaji Owolabi Amusat, the group said there are strong indications that bandits have perfected plans to strike in the South-West.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, bandits have variously attacked the North East, North West and North Central, leaving disturbing scenes of terror, killings and destruction that are capable of destroying the sanctity of Nigeria,\u201d it observed.\n\n\u201cOn this note, the South-West Security Stakeholders Group considered it necessary to beef up the security operations in our region, and we charge the police and other security architectures across the region to remain vigilant in ensuring that the region is safe. Any attempt to invade the region will be resisted by our group.\u201d\n\nThe group dismissed Sheikh Gumi\u2019s visit to Igboho town, adding that it was an attempt to mock and undermine the efforts of the Yoruba activist and freedom fighter. \u201cSheikh Gumi is a Nigerian, he has a right to visit any part of the country,\u201d it noted. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be to the extent of being deliberately attacking Igboho\u2019s ideology in his hometown. Such attempt is provocative, and can lead to crisis. That was why it elicited various reactions. Gumi\u2019s ideas are always at variance with the present realities in the country and it is better for him to desist from fanning the embers of discord in the country and the South-West in particular.\n\n\u201cSSSG is driven by the calls to ensure effective security across the South-West. We are also keen on regionalism where each region will control the security architecture of their respective space. If Nigeria didn\u2019t return to regionalism based on the true Federalism that we have in the past, there may be crisis and nobody should blame those agitating for self-determination.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, has criticised Gumi for his call for amnesty for the bandits and, for his attempt to compare them with Niger Delta militants.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Islamic cleric had urged the Federal Government to grant the bandits amnesty like it did to the militants that operated in the oil rich Niger Delta region. He also said that use of military force alone cannot subdue them, and warned of the danger of Nigeria turning becoming another Afghanistan.\n\nBut in an interview with Saturday Sun, Dr. Pogu condemned Gumi for his views while stating his reason that no mercy should be shown to them by Nigerian Armed Forces. \u201cWhen these bandits were killing innocent Nigerians, did they show mercy? The answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe olive branch was shown to them severally, with negotiations. Some of the governors in the North-West tried to discuss with them and nothing happened. They felt they were stronger than government. So, what the government is doing now is to tell the bandits that they were not stronger in anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe time for that amnesty that Sheikh Gumi was asking for has passed and elapsed. Let the military do the needful, so that they would be rooted out. Anybody who doesn\u2019t want to fight should surrender and face the natural justice of the law of Nigeria. If people start killing others, then anybody can start killing and plead for amnesty later; this will encourage others to go and be killing people. If they are decimated, others will learn a lesson and will not pick up arms against the people or against the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to subscribe to what Gumi is saying. I don\u2019t agree with him. It is unfortunate that he has sympathy for them. I don\u2019t have any sympathy for a terrorist. They come and murder and terrorise innocent citizens. They come with guns and kill the people. So, I\u2019m not in support of amnesty for them.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

Lord Richards, said the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan raised the prospect of \u201canother 9/11\u201d as ungoverned spaces opened up which the terrorists were able to exploit.\n\n\u201cI think we are (closer to another 9/11).

He stated further that in as much as the state government and the state legislature had enacted a law with respect to VAT, the courts were bound to obey such law.\n\nHe said the state government and the House of Assembly had duly enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax No. 4, 2021, which makes it legitimate right of the state to collect VAT.\n\nThe judge maintained that the law remained valid until it had been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nPam said granting the prayers of the FIRS would amount to committing murder and noted that the prayers could not stand.\n\nSanwo-Olu signs Lagos VAT law\n\nIn a related development, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday signed into law the State VAT Bill as passed by the House of Assembly.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by Gbenga Omotoso, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, \u201cthe Governor signed the bill for a law to impose and charge VAT on certain goods and services at about 11. 45 am today, after returning from an official trip to Abuja.

          "text": "Some friends and colleagues of Major Christopher Datong, who has spent 17 days in the captivity of the bandits who attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State, are making frantic efforts to rescue him, including raising a ransom, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Datong\u2019s military friends are keeping their ransom efforts as anonymous as possible in order not to incur punishments from the military authorities which are still bent on an obviously failed option of search-and-rescue.\n\n\n\nA top military source, however, confided in SaharaReporters that a ransom was being prepared among his friends in the Nigerian Army to be paid to the bandits through some religious negotiators.\n\nSaharaReporters had on August 25 reported that the bandits after abducting Datong got across to the military authorities to demand a ransom of N200million to free him.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that troops of the Nigerian Army and military aircraft searching for Major Datong, were having a tough time.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get Datong out first by all means. I mean; all means. Chris\u2019 friends are not quiet. A lot is going on underground. But you know the nature of the abduction is embarrassing. It involves a military officer; it involves a military establishment. Some of his friends want to pay money to get him out.\n\n\u201cThe names and details with the money are secret. The family members are not involved so as not to implicate any officer. But efforts are on,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, Abuja, in an initial release by Maj Gen Benjamin Sawyer, the Director, Defence Information, had stated that a board of enquiry was looking at the breach of security at the NDA.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity, to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice,\u201d he had said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Datong is still alive, according to a family source.\n\nA family member of the officer had told SaharaReporters on Wednesday that contrary to reports, he had not been killed and he was still alive.\n\nOn September 2, the military high command had during a briefing refused to give details of the condition of the Major.\n\nWhen asked on the whereabouts of the kidnapped Major at a press briefing at the Defence headquarters, Abuja, on Thursday, Brig Gen. Benard Onyeuko, acting director of Defence Media Operations, said the military would keep Nigerians posted.\n\n\u201cThat has been over-flogged; we all know the actions taken so far. We will wait for the outcome of the panel set up and the board of enquiry; we will keep you posted on that,\u201d he had said.",

          "text": "Some friends and colleagues of Major Christopher Datong, who has spent 17 days in the captivity of the bandits who attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State, are making frantic efforts to rescue him, including raising a ransom, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Datong\u2019s military friends are keeping their ransom efforts as anonymous as possible in order not to incur punishments from the military authorities which are still bent on an obviously failed option of search-and-rescue.\n\n\n\nA top military source, however, confided in SaharaReporters that a ransom was being prepared among his friends in the Nigerian Army to be paid to the bandits through some religious negotiators.\n\nSaharaReporters had on August 25 reported that the bandits after abducting Datong got across to the military authorities to demand a ransom of N200million to free him.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that troops of the Nigerian Army and military aircraft searching for Major Datong, were having a tough time.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get Datong out first by all means. I mean; all means. Chris\u2019 friends are not quiet. A lot is going on underground. But you know the nature of the abduction is embarrassing. It involves a military officer; it involves a military establishment. Some of his friends want to pay money to get him out.\n\n\u201cThe names and details with the money are secret. The family members are not involved so as not to implicate any officer. But efforts are on,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, Abuja, in an initial release by Maj Gen Benjamin Sawyer, the Director, Defence Information, had stated that a board of enquiry was looking at the breach of security at the NDA.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity, to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice,\u201d he had said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Datong is still alive, according to a family source.\n\nA family member of the officer had told SaharaReporters on Wednesday that contrary to reports, he had not been killed and he was still alive.\n\nOn September 2, the military high command had during a briefing refused to give details of the condition of the Major.\n\nWhen asked on the whereabouts of the kidnapped Major at a press briefing at the Defence headquarters, Abuja, on Thursday, Brig Gen. Benard Onyeuko, acting director of Defence Media Operations, said the military would keep Nigerians posted.\n\n\u201cThat has been over-flogged; we all know the actions taken so far. We will wait for the outcome of the panel set up and the board of enquiry; we will keep you posted on that,\u201d he had said.",

          "text": "Murtala Rufa\u2019i, a lecturer at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, says according to a 10-year research he conducted on banditry in Zamfara, people make money from transporting arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his report titled, \u201dI am a Bandit\u2019: A Decade of Research on Armed Banditry in Zamfara State\u2019, Rufa\u2019i said studies have shown that there are over 60,000 weapons in circulation in the north-west.\n\nHe said weapons like anti-aircraft guns, rocket propelled grenade tubes, general purpose machine guns, AK-47, AK-49, G3 magazines, among others, were found across different bandits\u2019 camps in the state.\n\nAccording to Rufa\u2019i, he conducted interviews with bandits and also visited some areas across the state, adding that the gunmen generate income through arms trading, while a significant percentage of such funds are spent on drugs, women, betting, phones and other goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost arguments on the source of weapons revolve around the porous border thesis and the inability of the security to man the over 1,950 official borders,\u201d the report, which was delivered at a seminar on September 9, reads.\n\n\u201cThere is absolute shortage of manpower and officers want to be posted to lucrative borders. The armed smugglers mostly used these minor entries for the supply of arms into the country.\u201d\n\nHe said some officers at border posts are alleged to have facilitated the movement of arms into the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, this could be part of the reason Muhammed Babandede, former comptroller-general of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), issued an order in 2020 that more officers be deployed to the borders.\n\n\u201cThus, the wider assumption is that arms supply in Zamfara is majorly from the Nigeria-Niger borders located around Zamfara, Sokoto and Katsina axis,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cThis is a plausible assumption as there are some border communities within these states with substantial number of individual gunrunners, whose main role is to simply move arms across the borders.\n\n\u201cSome of these illicit traffickers are well-known in their communities, while others remain unknown. Calamity could befall any community that expose these suppliers to security agencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince the Nigerian security operatives have complained of grossly inadequate personnel, in addition to proving incapable of defending the people from the rural war-lords, the best thing is to observe \u2018conspiracy of silence\u2019 for peace to reign in the villages.\n\n\u201cThere is also the use of women and children as couriers of arms along the border. It is very difficult to get a woman arm courier, but if you have any, they are the safest and easiest ways of cross-border arms movement.\n\n\u201cDepending on the distance and terrain, an AK47 rifle is transported into a nearby village from the border at the rate of N20,000, while a bag containing 100 rounds of ammunition at the cost of N5,000.\n\n\u201cThus, transporting the ammunition is much easier due to its size and could be divided into different portions, what the locals called Geron Hajiya.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said some of the gunmen have dislodged multiple agents who supply arms, and have become either importers or local transporters of arms.\n\nRufa\u2019i quoted an informant who spent five years as a bandit around Dan-Sadau area, as saying: \u201cI have wasted five years for nothing. Had it been I knew, I could have been a gunrunner earlier. There is more money, peace and pride to be in the arm supplying chain\u201d.\n\nOver the years, gunmen have attacked communities in Zamfara, despite the state\u2019s decision to grant amnesty to bandits.\n\nHowever, Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, on Friday, announced that his administration will no longer offer amnesty to bandits since they have \u201crefused to embrace peace\u201d.",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "NNPC N287bn Profit: Atedo Peterside Got it wrong \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLike doubting Thomas, Founder of IBTC Stanbic Bank, Atedo Peterside, in a tweet Sunday, 29 August called out the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to clarify a spurious allegation that it dipped its fingers in the federation account in order to announce a profit of N287bn.\n\nHe was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s public presentation of NNPC\u2019s audit report which posted a profit ofN287bn for the very first time in 44 years of the existence of the corporation. But a couple of questions for Atade Peterside and his ilk: is it possible for an entity, signatories of a corporation to dip their hands into the federation account? Does this make any sense? Obviously, their allegation is a white lie from the pit of hell that should be spurned by well meaning Nigerians.\n\nThe 2020 Audited Financial Statement of the NNPC is on its website for all to see as the current managers believe there is nothing to hide. The highlights of the 2020 AFS revealed that while the corporation\u2019s financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7% compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4% within the same period. The group working capital remained below the line at N4.56trillion in 2020 as against N.44trillion in 2019, a decrease that could be attributed to the decline in the production of crude oil due to global impact of Covid-19. It is important to emphasise that this is the third consecutive year, the NNPC under the watch of Mele Kyari is publishing its Audited Financial Statement. Should such a fellow be condemned or praised?\n\nNigerians can readily recall that President Muhammadu Buhari promised to turn around the fortunes of the then ailing national oil corporation and reposition it for profitability. This was the chief reason why he appointed Mallam Mele Kyari as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC in the first place. The strategy for the current handlers was clear: curb wastes, fight corruption, ensure transparency and accountability in line with the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Open Government Partnership (OGP), both multi-stakeholder global initiatives, to which Nigeria is signatory, but more importantly, in keeping with his administration\u2019s electoral promises to Nigerians.\n\nWhen in 2019 Financial Audit Statement, the NNPC age-long losses were reduced from N803bn to N1.7bn, it was obvious that the corporation was heading somewhere pursuant to government\u2019s agenda to turn around the fortunes of the NNPC. It was clear that if the right measures and controls were sustained, the corporation will eventually break the age-long jinx and so many watchers of events at the nation\u2019s oil corporation weren\u2019t too surprised when it eventually declared a net profit of N287billion in year 2020.\n\nThis, in my view, calls for celebration of persons who made it happen because, for the first time in its 44-year history, the bugaboo of NNPC having to make profits has been broken. It is common knowledge that the corporation under previous administrations and GMDs was a cesspool of corruption and notorious for national economic hemorrhage and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs). But all that is now history and people like Atedo Peterside are stupefied with the reality. They marvel in disbelief that something good is coming out of Nazareth. Peterside and his co-travelers can bear witness to the fact that there was no publication of annual financial statements until 2018 when Malam Kyari released the very first Audited Financial Statement of account of the NNPC. But the question to ask at this point is: where was Atedo Peterside and his breed all those years? He was never known, seen or heard to have asked any sort of question or comment he just made. Was Peterside not alive then? Has he suddenly woken up from slumber or just suddenly arrived from the moon to join the fray in making such unfounded allegation?\n\nNigerians are now home to the delivery of promised transparency and accountability by the current NNPC management. Acrimonious and distractive elements like Atedo Peterside do not need to make spurious, baseless and untenable allegations against the leadership of the NNPC. Apparently, Mele Kyari and his management team, working with the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari, have ensured that the NNPC did not only take steps to end the era of posting losses, but have gone ahead over time to post profit as revealed in the 2020 audit. Methinks they should be commended and not vilified by meddlesome interlopers.\n\nThe argument of Atedo Peterside that the NNPC ought not to post profit in year 2020 that had the covid-19 challenge falls flat on its face because, Atedo\u2019s Peterside\u2019s IBTC Stanbik Bank also posted profit same year of covid-19 devastation. Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc reported a profit after tax (PAT) of N83.211 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, showing an increase of 109 per cent compared to N75.035 billion in 2019.So where lies the argument that the NNPC shouldn\u2019t have posted profit in the year of economic crisis occasioned by covid-19. Why did they not post heavy losses to substantiate the point that no profit can be made in 2020, year of pandemic? It is common knowledge that covid was a global problem- while some oragnisations made profits, others suffered losses. That is business life for you and nobody should deride the other just to score cheap political or sectional point.\n\nIt is instructive to emphasise that Nigerians should not play ethnic or political cards when it comes to national economic issues. Better still, Atedo Peterside can throw his hat into the Nigerian political ring for the 2023 presidency or Governorship of his state so that he would have a first-hand experience in the political crucibles of this nation and for him to properly play politics in the real practical sense of the word instead of hiding under a business name to do so.\n\nNigerians are glad that, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari who was the target of the media onslaught against the corporation since the release of the 2020 audit report equally came out on TVC News to clarify that the 2020 profit was very low and a very small number. In his words: \u201cThis is potentially a trillion-naira company and of course with all expectation and all resources available to us, we should not be declaring losses at any time.\u201d Impliedly, the 2021 audit will post more profit than the 2020 FAS and the trend will not only continue, but have come to stay to perpetually shame Atade Peterside and his sort.\n\nWhen we use public space, sometimes, we forget that history lay ambush with a note pad. For the avoidance of doubt, Mele Kyari has been part of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) long before he became the GMD of the NNPC and I have personally met him in a number of NEITI meetings where he liberally canvassed the need for transparency and accountability in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry. It was therefore not surprising when appointed GMD he has given tacit support to implementation and abided by the general principles of the EITI in all his undertakings.\n\nUnder his watch, the NNPC joined a group of over 65 extractives companies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), commodity traders, financial institutions and industry partners committed to observing the EITI\u2019s supporting company expectations.\n\nThe NNPC we know before the coming on board of Mele Kyari and his management team operated as an opaque institution. This was pointed by NEITI in the very first forensic audit report which covered 1999-2004. As a matter of fact, since its inception in 2004, the NEITI has conducted eight independent audits in the oil and gas sector (1999\u20132004, 2005, 2006-2008, 2009-2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015) and one in the solid minerals sector (2015). All the reports have always been accompanied with recommendations based on findings relating to violations of stipulated laws and regulations on revenue or tax remittances by companies or receipts by government and its agencies.\n\nRegrettably, as a close stakeholder, majority of these recommendations have always been observed in breach by the companies and the various government agencies, as there are no legal authority to NEITI to enforce compliance or issue sanctions for ignoring them.\n\nConcerned about the recurring disregard to the recommendations in the NEITI audit reports, Mele Kyari, one of the earliest supporters of NEITI in the NNPC and his current management team chose to do things differently by working to bring an end to the era of opacity in the NNPC. Come on, this should be applauded by Nigerians and lovers of democracy anywhere in the world.\n\nTo demonstrate his commitment to taking NNPC to a profit-making corporation, Mele Kyari launched the Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) programme. The programme ensures elimination of discretions, automation of processes and documents, sustained stakeholders communications, evolvement of a culture of openness and disclosure as well as sharing of knowledge and data with deliberate creation of spaces for feedback and implementation of open contracting processes all geared towards transparency in the NNPC.\n\nIn the area of Accountability, TAPE ensures strict adherence to NNPC\u2019s business ethics, policies and procedures, ensure reliability in financial reporting as well as need to ensure the non-betrayal of the trust of over 200million Nigerians.\n\nTo ensure performance excellence, the Mele Kyari-led management set clear objectives and targets, capacity building and empowerment of staff and creation of value addition to NNPC bottom line, while making operational effectiveness and efficiency the new mantra of the corporation. This never happened in the history of the NNPC.\n\nMuch more, the Oil and Gas industry is now governed by a Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) with couple of sections dedicated to transparency and accountability in line with the current management\u2019s New Way of Working. These are novel and deft moves that the oil industry needed over the years but was deprived by forces of darkness in power that never wished the nation any good.\n\nIt was not therefore not any surprise to industry watchers that the NNPC steadily moved from drastic reduction in losses to posting profit in 2020. Our collective prayer is that this streak should endure so that the fortunes of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry can continue to flourish before the phase-out of the use of fossil fuel in Nigeria.\n\n______________________\n\nMr. Leo Atakpu, a Civil Society activist writes from Benin City, Edo State.\n\n...",
          "summary": "It is important to emphasise that this is the third consecutive year, the NNPC under the watch of Mele Kyari is publishing its Audited Financial Statement.\nNigerians can readily recall that President Muhammadu Buhari promised to turn around the fortunes of the then ailing national oil corporation and reposition it for profitability.\nThis was the chief reason why he appointed Mallam Mele Kyari as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC in the first place.\nThe NNPC we know before the coming on board of Mele Kyari and his management team operated as an opaque institution.\nTo demonstrate his commitment to taking NNPC to a profit-making corporation, Mele Kyari launched the Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) programme.",

Today, Thursday 9th September, 2021, a Caretaker Committee of the Council was inaugurated to pilot the affairs of the Council pending when it would be able to bring all parties together for a proper election to usher in a substantive State Working Committee for the Council.\n\nCarrying out the function of the inauguration, a 3- Man Committee made up of the National Trustee of Zone F, Comrade John Angese, Edo Council Chairman, Comrade Roland Osakue and Delta Council Secretary, Comrade Patrick Ochei effected the orders of the National Secretariat by duly constituting the Caretaker Committee with Comrade Amaechi Okonkwo of the Federated Correspondents\u2019 Chapel as Chairman and Comrade Justice Ihunwo of the Rivers State Television Chapel as the Secretary respectively.\n\nIt was a tug of war as the outgone Chairman and Secretary, Stanley Job and Ike Wigodo unleashed thugs from their camp on the delegated officers, whereby Edo Council Chairman was punched severally in an attempt to screen the SEC members who had filed out for inauguration.\n\nHowever, with the assistance of the Police and DSS officers mobilized to provide security based on the urging of Radio Rivers Chapel Chairman (the Chapel of Comrade Stanley Job), we were able to leave the NUJ Press Centre to Radio Rivers where the inauguration took place.\n\nBriefing the newsmen after the inauguration, the leader of the three man delegation, John Angese said there can never be a vacuum in any leadership position of NUJ, adding that the tenure of Stanley Job\u2019s Exco had expired since June and he should constitutionally vacate office rather than putting up a show to remain in office.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has charged the newly recruited personnel into the state\u2019s civil and public service to be dedicated and committed in the discharge of their duties, contributing significantly to the realization of the government\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda.\n\nObaseki gave the charge while delivering closing remarks at the closing ceremony for the on-boarding programme for the new workers employed into the Edo State Civil and Public Service, at the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Centre, in Benin City.\n\nThe programme, which lasted for four weeks, was for the on-boarding of the first batch of over 300 new recruits into the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nObaseki noted: \u201cToday, we are completing the on-boarding session for the first set of newly appointed public and civil servants. The 300 of you are the first set because of the limitations of resources. We also want to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in the training.\u201d\n\nThe governor disclosed that the vision of his administration is to ensure that 2,000 persons are employed into the service before the end of his tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe focus and plan of my administration is to recruit 2,000 into the Edo State Civil and Public Service before the end of my term as Governor of Edo State on November 12th, 2024. This will be a major transformation of the civil and public service in the State.\n\n\u201cThe public service is broken both at the state and federal levels, and not providing the services required for the people of this nation. This is why things are not going the way they should. We embarked on rebuilding the service to make things work in Edo State and Nigeria. For things to work the way they should, the civil service should function properly.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who assured the new workers of his administration\u2019s support, stated: \u201cWhatever we have built in this administration will continue by the time we leave office on November 12th, 2024. Until we settle the civil and public service as the engine room of government, government will not work.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou are all hired by your efforts and merit as no one had a hand in your employment. I urge you to be fearless in carrying out your responsibilities in your various offices. You owe your employment to nobody as nobody brought you in here; but God made it possible, and the need to deliver services to Edo people.\n\n\u201cYou must be fearless in carrying out your duties and responsibilities. No one can wake up and sack you. Just continue to do the right thing and deliver service to Edo people. The governor didn\u2019t give you the job, nor was it anyone that influenced your recruitment in the service, but your personal efforts and the help of God.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cI am one of those who believe that the remuneration and compensation paid to the public and civil servants are not enough. It is something we need to work on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the end of my tenure, we will break away from the federal remuneration structure and look for a way to pay realistic wages to public and civil servants. If you are hiring the best into the service, as we are doing today, we must compete with other sectors. To do this, good wages must be paid to keep the best in the service.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa said, \u201cthe employment process is based on merit, as no one influenced the employment of those that were employed. The new employees are the best and I see quality in them. The state will benefit from these people.\u201d\n\n...",

The witness said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nDays after the Lekki incident, Mr Fashola, while visiting the scene of the shooting, said he found a \u2018hidden camera\u2019 at the tollgate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

As the online relationships continued, the overseas co-conspirators requested increasingly larger sums of money, with the claimed purpose that the funds were needed to complete business projects or for them to return to the United States.\n\nThe victims were directed by the overseas co-conspirators to send funds to certain bank accounts, with assurance that the money would purportedly be allocated as needed.\n\nOther Nigerians connected with the case had been handed various prison terms.\n\nJohn Ogundele, 32, of New York, New York, was sentenced to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nPaul Usoro, 25, a Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, six of which were to be served in home confinement.\n\nJoshua Ditep, 26, a Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman, was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment, five of which were to be served in home confinement.\n\nTobiloba Kehinde, 29, a Nigerian citizen residing in Norman, was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, four of which were to be served in home confinement.\n\nChibuzo Obiefuna, 28, of Long Beach, California, and Jamiu Adedeji, 25, a Nigerian citizen residing in Norman, were each sentenced to time served.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Clinton J. Johnson for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and Special Agent in Charge Melissa Godbold of the FBI-Oklahoma City Field Office made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Oklahoma City Field Office conducted the investigation with assistance from the FBI\u2019s San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York Field Offices.\n\nTrial Attorneys Babasijibomi Moore of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Nassar of the Northern District of Oklahoma prosecuted the case.",

          "text": "Mr Gumi claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to deploy military against violent criminals thwarted his efforts to obtain amnesty for bandits and killer herders.\n\nA composite of Buhari, Bandits and Gumi used to illustrate this story\n\nIslamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi on Friday called for the establishment of a federal ministry to address the grievances of bandits and killer Fulani herders terrorising the country.\n\nMr Gumi, a self-appointed intermediary in the ongoing crises of banditry and killer herdsmen, said in a Facebook post on Friday that bandits should be rehabilitated like Niger Delta militants, adding that declaring war against bandits would be futile.\n\n\u201cSome said we have tried amnesty but it didn\u2019t work. You didn\u2019t try amnesty but tried amnesia. Amnesty without rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation is no amnesty,\u201d Mr Gumi said. \u201cAsk the former Niger Delta Militants who killed security men in the past what an amnesty is. What stops us from having a federal ministry of Nomadic Affairs where their grievances and complaints will be addressed?\u201d\n\nPresident Umar Yar\u2019Adua implemented an amnesty policy that saw the rehabilitation of thousands of Niger Delta militants who had waged a decade-long war on oil facilities across the region. The militants lamented economic deprivation and environmental degradation that assailed the oil-rich region, drawing both sympathy and condemnation from different segments of the society.\n\nThe militants accepted political and economic solutions, including the creation of a Niger Delta ministry, proposed by the Yar\u2019Adua administration and relinquished their arms and ammunition, marking an end of hostilities that saw the destruction of oil installations and deadly attacks on local and expatriate oil workers.\n\nMr Gumi\u2019s statement came days after Katsina Governor Aminu Masari openly admitted that Fulanis are the bandits and herders responsible for the widespread killing and abduction across the country.\n\nMr Gumi said his efforts to get amnesty for bandits and killer herdsmen have been sabotaged by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to deploy troops against violent criminals.\n\n\u201cSome disingenuous people say: peace and negotiations with herdsmen bandits have failed, and your mission has failed! I said my mission has not failed but it was sabotaged or discouraged by the same influential people that benefit from the chaos or like us to destroy ourselves and leave the herdsmen in perpetual ignorance,\u201d Mr Gumi said.\n\nIn the Facebook post, Mr Gumi also slammed presidential spokesman Femi Adesina for mocking him as a bandit lover for his open support alliance with the bandits, who have been responsible for widespread killing, destruction and mass abduction of citizens, including schoolchildren.\n\n\u201cYou bootlicker that called me a bandit-lover! I am not one, but my country-lover, my region-lover, my state-lover, and my people-lover, and humanity-lover,\u201d Mr Gumi said to Mr Adesina without naming him.\n\nIt was unclear whether or not Mr Buhari was weighing amnesty for bandits as a sustainable solution to the acute insecurity that threatens to define his legacy. A State House spokesman did not return a request for comment on Saturday morning.\n\nRead Mr Gumi\u2019s full statement below;\n\nWAR HAS NEVER BEEN A SOLUTION ANYWHERE ANYTIME\n\nYou bootlicker that called me a bandit-lover! I am not one, but my country-lover, my region-lover, my state-lover, and my people-lover, and humanity-lover.\n\nI am a qualified Medical Doctor who knows what it takes to precisely excise a brain tumour without destroying the delicate surrounding brain tissues. I was a commissioned military officer who knows what the military is for and what is the capability of our military. I am an intellectual with a Ph.D. from Abroad. I am an Islamic scholar who knows the immorality of killing innocent lives. So, silence for me in this ocean of oblivion is not an option.\n\nOnly a fool would allow his dwelling to be a theatre of war. Unfortunately, how many fools are there. Killing rats in your rat-infested sitting room with an iron rod will only end up destroying your gadgets and furniture probably without killing any. We should not mask out poor governance with artillery power.\n\nSome disingenuous people say: peace and negotiations with herdsmen bandits have failed, and your mission has failed!\n\nI said my mission has not failed but it was sabotaged or discouraged by the same influential people that benefit from the chaos or like us to destroy ourselves and leave the herdsmen in perpetual ignorance.\n\nSome said we have tried amnesty but it didn\u2019t work. You didn\u2019t try amnesty but tried amnesia. Amnesty without rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation is no amnesty. Ask the former Niger Delta Militants who killed security men in the past what an amnesty is. What stops us from having a federal ministry of Nomadic Affairs where their grievances and complaints will be addressed?\n\nAll the bandit leaders we saw complained of how some repentant ones were picked and extra-judicially killed after the surrender of their weapons. Without their trust of the very unjust system all Nigerians complain of, which they took arms to fight, peace and negotiations with them will not work. This brings our role of mediation. They know as religious men we will not deceive them, and they came out in troops to meet us. To our astonishment, it is the same unjust system that turns round to betray our peace mission. Some of the press for giving a negative narrative, whom I also term criminals-in-purpose, some of the politicians who I see as urban-bandits who out of their share mismanagement of our meagre resources and misplacement of priority cause the death and infirmity of more people than the bandits affect.\n\nOf recent, how many Nigerians die of cholera -a water-born disease- because of lack of simple clean water to drink, or typhoid, malaria, and malnutrition? A nation with a maternal mortality rate of almost 500000/annum because of the lack of adequate maternal health facilities and qualified staff. A country where its highly-priced medical personnel is looking for a window to escape the inferno. Such a country, please!\n\nBy the way, what you may not hear, is that the bandits over the years have developed escape routes from aerial bombardments. They told us: you can only kill our women and children with your attacks!\n\nJust yesterday, two contingents of banditry victims came to me that their loved ones were abducted by bandits in Kaduna suburbs \u2013 Rigachukun and Keke. An escapee engineer in the later said, when he overheard and understood that they were strangers in the area as they were calling the locals to lead them, that gave him the courage to slip through densely grown maize plantations to escape. The point is that, if Zamfara is on fire for them, definitely it goes without saying that they will migrate to other areas. So, is the whole of Nigeria going to be under lock-up in incommunicado?\n\nAs for the economic impact of the areas now under siege, it\u2019s just a matter of time, you\u2019ll hear them crying out. Already yesterday a man from Tsafe came begging because of economic stagnation, one would have thought that Gusau the capital is closer than Kaduna to beg.\n\nAs for those cynics that have no value to add in the dilemma except vituperation, and abuses, we know that is the substance they are made up of. No qualms whatsoever! you don\u2019t expect fragrance from faeces.\n\nSo, what is the solution?\n\nGood Intelligence! Good proficient policing, engagement of the local herdsmen in policing, rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation of all victims of banditry. The good honest judiciary protects people\u2019s rights. Money and time well spent on these will surely kill the disease and heal the nation of this delinquency, crimes, and bad governance.\n\nOh Allah! on Your Mercy we depend. GUMI.",

It will be on 17th September, Court Room No 4, Federal High Court Abuja, behind the Federal Ministry of Justice. Time: 10am.\u201d\n\nThe court hearing comes six months after a letter written by the Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABDON) requested that those who are being detained by the Department of State Services be admitted on bail, pending the conclusion of the investigation.\n\nThe source who spoke to SaharaReporters said the court first sat on the 18th of August but the DSS refused to come to court with the defendants.\n\nHe said the lawyers of the operators requested that his clients appear in court during the next sitting which was on September 2.\n\nHowever, the hearing could not hold due to the ailing health of the presiding judge. The defendants, it was gathered, were not brought to the court.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe association of bureau de change operators hired a barrister for their members. They went for a court sitting and the barrister wanted the DSS to bring his clients for the next sitting.\n\n\u201cThe judge asked the DSS to bring the clients. But even during the second court sitting, the operators were absent. The DSS asked the judge to give them extra days but he said no that they already had enough time to carry out an investigation.\n\n\u201cThe hearing was scheduled for September 2 again but the DSS did not come to the court with the operators and the judge was not feeling well so it was rescheduled again.\u201d\n\nIn March, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the Nigerian government arrested the Bureau De Change operators who were facilitating the transfer of money to Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nHe had said some Nigerians transferring money to the sect from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were working with the BDC operators.\n\n\u201cBureaus de change are facilitating money to terrorists. We have already worked with the UAE. Convictions have been achieved of Nigerians who are transferring money to Boko Haram terrorists and this also happens domestically. And I tell you that by the time we finish this investigation, the shocking details will surprise many Nigerians,\u201d Shehu had said.\n\nDozens of persons have been arrested by security agents in an ongoing nationwide crackdown on suspected financiers and collaborators of Boko Haram.\n\nThose arrested are being kept in military and DSS facilities in Abuja and other places.\n\nMultiple sources said the closely guarded operation is being coordinated by Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), in collaboration with the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).",

          "text": "Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, claimed on Saturday that the National Assembly spends less than 2% of the national budget, and wondered why no one is questioning the other 98%.\n\nGbajabiamila said this as his reaction to a statement credited to the Vice-Chancellor of Ahman Pategi University, Patigi, Kwara state, Professor Mahfouz Adedimeji, who opined that Nigeria runs the most expensive National Assembly in the world.\n\nThe university boss and the Speaker both spoke at the 10th annual symposium of the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria, B-Zone, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nProf. Adedimeji, who was the guest lecturer at the occasion touched on the theme, \u2018Saving a nation on the precipice: between re-federation and secessionalism.\u2019\n\nAdedimeji had emphasised the need to rejig the operations of the legislature in Nigeria, stating that the nation\u2019s parliament is the most expensive in the world.\n\n\u201cWith due respect to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nigeria spends the highest amount of money on the legislators in the world and the National Assembly consumes more money than any other parliament in the world.\n\n\u201cA unicameral legislature with two representatives from each state is sufficient. The National Assembly should have less than 100 members, including Abuja,\u201d the varsity don\u2019t said in his lecture.\n\nHowever, Gbajabiamila absolutely disagreed with the Vice-Chancellor, describing his perception as wrong.\n\nGbajabiamila who was represented as the Chairman of the occasion by Hon. Ibrahim Isiaka of Ifo/Ewekoro constituency, mentioned that the money budgeted for the National Assembly was two per cent of the total budget.\n\n\u201cNo one till today has actually sat down to go into research and define the meaning of legislators.\n\n\u201cThe money being spent on the national assembly is less than two per cent of the total budget of this country; but nobody, has ever looked at what is happening to the remaining 98 per cent. And when you say National Assembly, you are not talking about legislators, who are the lawmakers only. You are also talking about the National Assembly Commission, you are talking about everything, all encompassing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Speaker regretted that no one had ever sat down to go into research and define what the National Assembly actually means.\n\nHe charged Nigerians to change the perception that Nigeria runs the most expensive National Assembly in the world.",

The hospital was sealed and thoroughly combed, but the baby could not be found,\u201d he said.\n\nHe revealed that the suspects were arrested following an intelligence report.\n\n\u201cIntelligence report led to the arrest of one Maryam Sadiq, 22, and her husband, one Abubakar Sadiq, 50 years, both of Rijiyar Zaki quarters, Kano. The baby was recovered from them in their home.\n\n\u201cDuring preliminary investigations, Maryam confessed to have taken the baby from the hospital.

          "text": "Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Katsina Chapter has distanced itself from the recent unguarded outburst credited to its National Scribe, Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe Chairman of the Katsina State, Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye, condemned the unguided utterances about Governor Masari by their National Secretary, would necessitate the National Chairman and executive members to visit Katsina to seek for Governor\u2019s forgiveness over the derogatory remarks.\n\nAt a press briefing held at the NUJ Secretariat on Friday, the state chairman condemned the unguarded derogatory statement of the National Secretary, saying it does not in any way reflect the view of the association at both the national and state chapter.\n\n\u201cWe request to have your indulgence this morning to make some issues clear as far as the relationship between Miyetti Allah Hore and the Katsina Government is concerned.\n\n\u201cOne of us, the national secretary of Miyetti Allah, cattle Hore, Alhassan Saleh, made some negative utterances against His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, which were found so heavy to the entire Fulani race across the landscape of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe National Secretariat of Miyetti Allah Hore has already distanced itself from those negative utterances made by Alhassan Saleh, and we felt it is imperative for us as the state chapter of the Miyetti Allah Hore to align ourselves with the National Secretariat of our noble union and distance ourselves equally.\n\n\u201cAs such, we felt it will be important for us to make ourselves clear on those utterances. He made the utterances on his own,, and he is standing alone as far as we are concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has shown some signs of remorse when he was contacted by the national chairman,\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, please forgive and forget those utterances because we are law-abiding citizens of this country. Miyetti Allah cattle Hore is a registered and law-abiding association.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of Miyetti Allah Hore is coming to Katsina personally with his Executives to plead with His Excellency to forgive and forget those negative utterances for us to continue to forge ahead, to continue to make some progress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot complete this press briefing without noticing some contribution made by His Excellency. Already you are aware that there\u2019s a standing committee for the relationship between herders and farmers in Katsina State, which is making a very comprehensive and very successful negotiation with the farmers where we have some cattle routes being encroached, and already they have been demarcated by the standing committee with the support of Katsina State Government.\n\nIn a nutshell, we are here to say that the utterances made by our national secretary are not good.\n\nAt least by the age of His Excellency and the position he is occupying, he deserves some respect so that the successes we have been recording, from the inception of this administration will continue to thrive.\n\nRecalled Alhassan Saleh recently granted an interview to Sahara Reporters to elicit his reactions on a recent interview Governor Masari granted to Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today\u2019 programme where the Governor stated that many of the bandits terrorizing the North are from Fulani extraction involved in cattle rearing,\n\nIn his response, Saleh painted the Katsina Governor in derogatory terms for daring to label the Fulani as being primarily responsible for banditry in the North.\n\nThe National Secretary, while urging Nigerians to ignore Masari\u2019s statement, throwing caution into the air, described Governor Masari as a confused drunkard.\n\n\u201cDid you take that drunkard serious? My governor, do you take him seriously? Can\u2019t you see that he is already tired? Records should come from security operatives, not confused human beings.\n\n\u201cAll of them talking, they are stealing security votes, they should find solutions, create ranches for these herders and accommodate them.\n\n\u201cWhich people do you find along the Sahel Sahara desert? They are many tribes, is it by a physique that you now identify a Fulani man? The bandits are criminals, why should you attach a tribe to it? That\u2019s why we are not happy. You don\u2019t need to attach a tribe because it will affect an innocent person.\n\n\u201cForget that man, that man is the worst Governor Katsina has had; we are just praying for his time to lapse.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Katsina State chapter Chairman of Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye said that the National Secretary has since regretted his actions.",

          "text": "Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu has said the comprehensive approach to resolving current Nigeria\u2019s challenges is through confronting adult illiteracy and paying attention to out of school children.\n\nDisclosing this at the 2021 International Literacy Day, ILD, held in Abuja on Tuesday, Adamu said the Nigerian government is determined to confront the adult literacy programmes with the same zeal it is handling out of school children.\n\nHe said developing, sustaining and enhancing literacy skills is a lifelong and community-wide endeavour, requiring a strong commitment from the society as a whole.\n\nThe Minister said Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 calls on countries to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u2019. Specifically, SDG Target 4.6 requires that by 2030, member states should ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, it is estimated that over 6.9 million children are out of school.\n\nThis is in addition to the estimated 38% of non literate adult Population. Investing in Education of the parents will have ripple effect on the reduction of out of school Children.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that non-literate parents are more likely to breed out of school children, thereby compounding the phenomenon facing our nation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile flagging off the national activities to commemorate the 2021\n\nInternational Literacy Day, Adamu urged all stakeholders, including the journalists, to make a difference by complementing government\u2019s efforts in the fight against illiteracy in our various schedules, homes, families and immediate communities.\n\nAdamu commended Director General of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation,UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay and her staff for their continued support in coordinating wide-ranging technical and financial assistance of the UN system, donor countries and the private sector, in country-level implementation of initiatives and programmes aimed at reducing the scourge of illiteracy worldwide.\n\nAlso, speaking the UNESCO Representative, Mammadou Lamine Sow said the COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst disturbance to education and training systems in a century, with the longest school closures affecting more than 1.6 billion learners at its peak time.\n\nHe quoted the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) by November 2020, which said the average child had lost 54 percent of a year\u2019s contact time, which could be interpreted as the loss of over a year\u2019s learning if the time of forgetting what was previously acquired is counted.\n\nHe said \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the fragility of many youth and adult literacy programmes, systems and policies as represented by the abrupt suspension of numerous programmes. Consequently, we need to reflect on what action can be taken to achieve SDG 4, target 6 by \u201censuring that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy\u201d by 2030.\u201d\n\nSow said the current shift to digital teaching and learning has further widened the inequalities to the detriment of the non-formal education sub-sector.\n\nThis shift, according to him, has also highlighted the persistent digital divide in terms of connectivity, infrastructure, and the ability to engage with technology.",

          "title": "Lekki Shooting: Integrity Of Scene Had Been Compromised Before Forensic Analysis, Says Expert",
          "text": "The forensic team that presented its report to the Lagos State Judicial Panel on Friday said the integrity of the scene of the Lekki Toll Gate shooting had been compromised long before forensic investigations.\n\nManaging Director of Sentinel Forensics Limited, Mr Joseph Funsho-Ako, explained that the compromise was because the team visited the toll gate, 87 days after the October 20, 2020 incident.\n\nHe added that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) had even carried out a clean-up of the area before the visit by the forensic team.\n\nREAD ALSO: No More Amnesty For Bandits In Zamfara, Says Matawalle\n\nFunsho-Ako spoke about the incident in a testimony when he appeared on Saturday before the Lagos Judicial Panel on restitution for victims of SARS-related abuses and other matters.\n\nHe later answered questions under cross-examination from the counsel to the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Bernard Onigah.\n\nIn the process, he explained that based on the information that the area had been cleaned up earlier, his firm called LAWMA, requesting information that could help with its forensic investigations, but they did not get any response.\n\nOn the ballistic evidence, he affirmed that the live ammunition presented by the Nigerian Army was of the same calibre as the cartridge casing submitted by the panel.\n\nBut the witness stressed the need for further analysis, to determine whether the expended live ammunition casings were fired by the army.\n\nAs at the time of this report, the forensic expert was being cross-examined by different lawyers at the panel.\n\nSaturday\u2019s session is the 123rd sitting of the panel following the hearing of the petitions of various victims of police abuse, during which some were awarded varying sums as compensation.\n\nThe focus at the latest proceeding was the long-awaited forensic report for the Lekki Tollgate Shooting which sparked widespread condemnation within and outside the country.\n\nSentinel Forensics Limited was engaged by the Lagos State government on December 29, 2020, to conduct a forensic review of the unfortunate incident that occurred about two months earlier.\n\nThe firm\u2019s mandate required it to conduct a crime scene investigation at the toll plaza, submit a detailed report on the investigation, and examine the CCTV footage of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC), among other things.\n\nIt was also asked to give a digital forensic expert opinion on the recording of incidents on the day of the shooting, provide an expert opinion on any evidence recovered during the scene visit by panel members, as well as submit a detailed comprehensive forensic report on the subject.\n\nArmy Not Indicted\n\nMeanwhile, Funsho-Ako has refuted what he described as \u201cfalse publications\u201d on the testimony his firm gave before the panel on Friday.\n\nHe faulted the reports suggesting that his team\u2019s findings indicted the Nigerian Army in the shooting of peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in October 2020.\n\n\u201cThis biased and unbalanced reporting is false and fake news,\u201d said the witness. \u201cOur forensic specialist commented on record that following an extensive scene investigation at the Lekki Toll Plaza (TP1) by our team of specialists, about 87 days after the incident, there was an absence of any physical evidence supporting the allegations of discharge of live ammunition by Nigerian Army personnel.\n\n\u201cThis scene investigation was conducted days after Sentinel Forensics Limited was engaged by the judicial panel of inquiry.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the ballistic evidence presented to the specialists for forensic examination by the panel, they found that two cartridge casings (expended/fired) of 7.62 x 39mm ammunition was tendered by the judicial panel as evidence recovered at the scene, while one unit of live (unexpended/not fired) ammunition and one unit of cartridge case (expended/fired round) 7.62 x 39mm ammunition was tendered by the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe Nigerian Army was also said to have tendered a unit of blank (unexpended/not fired) 7.62 x 51mm ammunition and a unit of blank (expended/fired round) 7.62 x 51mm ammunition.\n\nThe witness had told the panel on Friday, among other things, that the live ammunition tendered as exhibit by the Nigerian Army was of the same type of cartridge and calibre as the ammunition casings tendered by the judicial panel which was 7.62 x 39mm.\n\nHe added that the blank ammunition tendered was of a different cartridge type 7.62mm x 51mm.\n\nThe firm had also released a statement and its representative stressed this position on Saturday, at the resumed hearing, saying their job was not to ascribe guilt or innocence on anyone, but only to provide clarification to help the panel reach its decision on the matter.\n\nIn her reaction, the chairperson of the judicial panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, asked the media to be professional and responsible in its reportage of the public hearing.",

The overseas co-conspirators told victims that they were U.S. residents working or traveling abroad.\n\n\u201cAs the online relationships continued, the overseas co-conspirators requested increasingly larger sums of money, with the claimed purpose that the funds were needed to complete business projects or for them to return to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe victims were directed by the overseas co-conspirators to send funds to certain bank accounts, with an assurance that the money would purportedly be allocated as needed.\u201d\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Clinton J. Johnson for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and Special Agent in Charge Melissa Godbold of the FBI-Oklahoma City Field Office made the announcement.\n\nFBI\u2019s Field Office in Oklahoma City conducted the investigation with assistance from the agency\u2019s San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York Field Offices.\n\nTrial Attorneys Babasijibomi Moore of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Nassar of the Northern District of Oklahoma prosecuted the case.\n\n\u201cThis case is part of an ongoing national effort by the Department of Justice to address online fraud schemes, including those based out of Nigeria, that target U.S. citizens and residents,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "At least 20 people have been killed in fighting between militias and Myanmar\u2019s security forces, according to witnesses and Myanmar media, in the worst violence since opponents of the military government called this week for a \u201cpeople\u2019s defensive war\u201d.\n\nThe latest violence comes as activists and anti-military forces urged the international community on Saturday to take action, saying the lack of any \u201cmeaningful outside intervention\u201d has led to the armed resistance.\n\n\u201cThe young people of Myanmar [have] no choice but to fight back with what they have,\u201d the Civil Disobedience Movement said in a statement early on Saturday, as it called on the United Nations and representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d with the opposition National Unity Government (NUG).\n\nAhead of a UN General Assembly meeting to decide who represents Myanmar as a special envoy, opposition forces are also launching a campaign this weekend to press for the recognition of the NUG as the legitimate government representative.\n\nThe NUG, formed to resist the army\u2019s February 1 takeover, had earlier called for a revolt against the military rule, in an apparent effort to coordinate groups fighting the army and convince soldiers and state officials to switch sides.\n\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the overthrow of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government, which ended a decade of tentative democracy and sparked nationwide anger, strikes and protests, and saw the emergence of militia groups that have attacked security forces.\n\nAccording to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors the human rights situation in Myanmar, at least 1,058 people have already been killed since the uprising against the military began. More than 6,300 others are currently in detention.\n\nMore arrests were reported on Saturday morning across the country, including in the country\u2019s largest city of Yangon and in Sagaing Region.\n\nFighting since Thursday between the military and defence volunteers allied with the unity government in Myin Thar village resulted in casualties among local militias and villagers as troops used heavy artillery, according to media and a witness.\n\n\u201cThey fired artillery, they burned down houses in our village,\u201d said a resident, 42, who added that three children as well as his 17-year-old son, a member of the militia, were among 20 people killed.\n\n\u201cI lost all I have \u2026 I will not forgive them until the end of the world,\u201d he told Reuters news agency by phone, adding he struggled to recognise his son\u2019s body.\n\nSocial media posts on Friday and Saturday also paid tribute to the people killed, including young men who appeared to be minors.\n\nBBC Burmese said on Friday that 10 people were killed in Myin Thar in the Magway Region of central Myanmar, while the Irrawaddy news website reported 17 casualties, among them minors.\n\nMilitary spokesman Zaw Min Tun confirmed fighting took place in Magway, according to Irrawaddy. The spokesman did not answer Reuters calls seeking comment.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours urged restraint from all sides following Tuesday\u2019s call for nationwide retaliation by the shadow government.\n\nSome analysts have warned the move could backfire and complicate the opposition\u2019s efforts to win international support. But the opposition said the lack of international support has prompted activists and other people to take the matter into their hands.\n\nIrrawaddy also reported the killing of three soldiers in the biggest city, Yangon, on Thursday.\n\nClashes erupted on Thursday and continued late on Friday in Thantlang in Chin State, bordering India, news reports also said.\n\nRadio Free Asia and Mizzima news service said the military conducted air raids. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe NUG\u2019s defence minister did not respond to a request for confirmation of the incidents on Thursday and Friday.\n\nReuters could not verify the reports of clashes, which state-run MRTV made no mention of in its nightly news bulletin.\n\nThe military tightly controls information and state media outlets have been selective in reporting unrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, about a dozen military-owned communications towers were destroyed. The same day, a shadow government working to reverse the coup called for a \u201cpeople\u2019s defensive war against the junta\u201d.",

          "text": "World number one Novak Djokovic won a gruelling five-setter against Alexander Zverev to set up a US Open final against Daniil Medvedev and keep his bid for a calendar Grand Slam on track.\n\nRussian second seed Medvedev had earlier kept alive his hopes of a first major title with a 6-4 7-5 6-2 win over Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.\n\nDjokovic then recovered from falling a set behind to win 4-6 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-2.\n\nHe now has the chance to win a record 21st men\u2019s Grand Slam singles title.\n\nVictory over Medvedev on Sunday at Flushing Meadows would move Djokovic clear of the 20 majors won by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.\n\nHistory-chasing Djokovic would also become the first man to win all four majors in the same year since Rod Laver in 1969.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one match left, all in, let\u2019s do it. I\u2019m going to put my heart and my soul and my body and my head into that one,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cI am going to treat the next match like it is the last match in my career.\u201d\n\nIn fourth seed Zverev, Djokovic came up against a player who six weeks ago ended his hopes of another slice of history, the \u2018Golden Slam\u2019, by beating him at the Olympics.\n\nThe 34-year-old must have feared a repeat when he double-faulted to hand Zverev the chance to serve for the opening set. His opponent obliged despite double-faulting himself on his first set point.\n\nEarly in the second the roles were reversed, Zverev missing a straightforward forehand and following up with a double fault as Djokovic broke and then cantered through the set to level.\n\nZverev was frustrated at not being able to convert a break in the opening game of the third and again missed a chance at 2-2, only to later present Djokovic with three set points.\n\nHe saved two, the second in a remarkable 53-shot rally, but Djokovic smashed away the third at the net to take the lead and celebrated by rousing the crowd with his arms aloft.\n\nZverev again engineered break points at 1-1 in the fourth set and this time zipped a forehand winner beyond his opponent as he held on to that advantage to force a decider.\n\nIt was Djokovic who found the breakthrough in Zverev\u2019s opening service game in the fifth set and the Serb\u2019s enduring class showed through as he raced into a 5-0 lead.\n\nZverev, who at 24 is 10 years Djokovic\u2019s junior, got on the board and then clawed back one break to keep the semi-final alive, much to the New York crowd\u2019s delight.\n\nThe three-time US Open champion hit straight back to bring up match point on Zverev\u2019s serve and sealed his place in the final when his opponent found the net after three hours and 33 minutes of tennis.\n\n\u201cThank you, the atmosphere was amazing \u2013 the best atmosphere of the tournament so far,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cThese are the moments we live for, the unique opportunities we dream of every day when we wake up and are trying to find the motivation to go out and do the same things over again.\u201d\n\nThis absorbing match boasted a 53-shot rally and was watched in the Arthur Ashe Stadium by Rod Laver \u2013 the man whose achievement Djokovic will try to emulate on Sunday.\n\nNot always at his best from the baseline, Djokovic qualified for a record-equalling 31st Grand Slam final with exceptional serving and trademark mental resilience.\n\nHe then promised to play Sunday\u2019s final as if it were the final match of his career.\n\nThe world number one has spent five and a half hours longer on court than Medvedev thus far. A hot and humid climax is forecast for Sunday, and with the pressure of chasing history, the 28th and final hurdle could yet be the hardest to clear.\n\nMedvedev will contest his third Grand Slam final on Sunday, having lost the 2019 final at Flushing Meadows to Rafael Nadal and the Australian Open final to Djokovic in February.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who has won titles on the hard courts in Marseille and Toronto this year, conceded his only set of the tournament during his four-set win over Dutch qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in the previous round, during a largely trouble-free run to the final.\n\nMedvedev ominously broke to love in the seventh game of the opening set against Auger-Aliassime, choosing his moment to apply pressure and put his 21-year-old opponent on the back foot.\n\nThe second set proved far trickier for the Russian, as Auger-Aliassime \u2013 contesting his first Grand Slam semi-final \u2013 clinched a second break-point opportunity before holding serve to lead 5-2.\n\nThe set \u2013 and a chance for the Canadian to level the match \u2013 unravelled from there.\n\nTwice unable to convert at set point, Auger-Aliassime was punished by Medvedev, who broke back and rattled through four successive games to abruptly end his opponent\u2019s momentum and take a two-set lead.\n\nAfter an opening hold of serve in the third set, the 12th seed\u2019s challenge capitulated as the world number two claimed another double break to cruise into a 5-1 advantage before wrapping up another commanding victory on serve.",

          "text": "Emma Raducanu will seek to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in 44 years when she takes on fellow teenager Leylah Fernandez in an unlikely US Open final between two players who have lit up New York.\n\nA final between the world numbers 150 and 73 was never predicted, nor should it even be as thrilling a prospect as it is, but this US Open \u2013 and these two players \u2013 have defied expectations at every turn.\n\nRaducanu\u2019s story is the stuff of dreams \u2013 ranked too low to make the main draw, the 18-year-old had to come through three rounds of qualifying and has become the first qualifier to reach a major final.\n\nAnd she did all that without dropping a set.\n\nFernandez, 19, has brushed aside a series of leading players \u2013 taking out defending champion Naomi Osaka, fifth seed Elina Svitolina, world number two Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber.\n\nTheir different paths and contrasting styles \u2013 but similarly fearless approach \u2013 have set up the first Grand Slam final between teenagers since the 1999 US Open when Serena Williams beat Martina Hingis.\n\nA maiden major beckons for one of them but regardless of whose name is etched onto the trophy, they have both shown there is a bright future for tennis at a time when fans were wondering who might fill the void when the sport\u2019s biggest names eventually retire.\n\nRaducanu\u2019s exploits have drawn praise from royalty, politicians and rock stars, as well as pundits and fans.\n\nIf she finally ends the country\u2019s wait for a first female Grand Slam singles champion since Virginia Wade\u2019s 1977 Wimbledon triumph, someone might have to invent some new superlatives as they have all been used to describe her already.\n\nWhat has been impressive is that not only is she 18, but she has clinically beaten much more experienced players such as Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and 17th seed Maria Sakkari with a fearless game that shows great variety, as well as the intelligence to change tactics on the spot.\n\nAnd then there is that smile.\n\nSo relaxed has she appeared at times that she has managed to beam between points, and the mega-watt grin that has lit up the Arthur Ashe Stadium after converting match points has won over local fans as well as those back home.\n\nShe has already achieved so much in just three months, reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon on her Grand Slam debut, rising from 338 in the rankings to just outside the top 30 when they are next published on Monday, and she will also become British number one.\n\n\u201cWhen you see that kind of talent, that won\u2019t be denied,\u201d 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Martina Navratilova said.\n\n\u201cShe is almost like the finished product, when she is just getting started.\u201d\n\nBritish fans will be relieved the final is at a much more palatable time of 21:00 BST, with many having set their alarms for the middle of the night when she played her semi-final.\n\n\u201cThe whole country will be cheering you on in the final,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted.\n\nOf course Fernandez, who is just two months older than Raducanu and turned 19 this week, has been living her own dream at Flushing Meadows.\n\nShe, too, has been showered with congratulations, and among the messages from the prime minister and top sports people, there was this bit of advice from Canadian ice hockey captain Marie-Philip Poulin: \u201cMake sure to have that maple syrup before the final!\u201d\n\nFernandez\u2019s matches have been stickier affairs than Raducanu\u2019s, with four of her six matches going to three sets and featuring five tie-breaks. The Briton, by contrast, has not dropped a set or faced even a tie-break.\n\nBut Fernandez\u2019s opponents have been bigger names and her demeanour on court is also different to Raducanu\u2019s.\n\nThe left-handed Canadian loves fist-pumping and revving the crowd up to get behind her, while Raducanu cuts a serene figure.\n\nThe pair, who were both born in Canada to immigrant parents, have grown up playing in the juniors together, facing each other in the second round of junior Wimbledon in 2018.\n\nRaducanu won that match 6-2 6-4. But so much has changed for both players since then that it cannot possibly be a gauge of what Saturday will bring.\n\nSuch is the attention that this match-up is attracting, Novak Djokovic\u2019s quest for a record 21st men\u2019s major and a calendar Grand Slam has been slightly overshadowed.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all just super hungry to make a difference in the tennis world,\u201d said Fernandez. \u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about and joked around that we\u2019re going to be in the WTA Tour and we\u2019re going to be on the big stage together.\n\n\u201cWe want to make a difference. We want to make an impact in tennis.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the result in the final, they have certainly done that already.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday met with leaders of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) at the State House, Abuja, over the 40-day-old industrial action embarked upon by resident doctors in the country, and pleaded with them to return to work, saying the timing of the strike was wrong.\n\nAside from asking the health workers to return to their duty posts, the president urged others contemplating strikes to opt for settlement of issues through negotiation, \u201cno matter how long it takes.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cThe lives of citizens that could be lost or damaged when doctors withdraw services, are precious enough to worth opting for peaceful resolution of differences.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile hailing the intervention of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) to resolve issues surrounding the strike, the President also called on the resident doctors to see reason and return to work.\n\nThe President assured that all outstanding benefits owed medical doctors would be cleared, after verification, adding that embarking on industrial action at a critical health period for the country and citizens was not a good option.\n\nHe said: \u201cProtecting our citizens is not to be left to government alone, but taken as a collective responsibility, in which especially medical professionals play a critical role. Let me speak directly to the striking doctors. Embarking on industrial action at this time when Nigerians need you most is not the best action to take, no matter the grievances.\n\n\u201cThis Administration has a good track record of paying all debts owed to government workers, pensioners and contractors and we have even revisited debts left by past administrations, once due verification is done. Debts genuinely owed health workers will be settled.\n\n\u201cI learnt that some of the 12-point demands in the ongoing strike were already addressed. Though, the review of a new Hazard Allowance has not been fully negotiated because of the sharp and deep division within the ranks of the striking doctors.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari said the outstanding issue of an Establishment circular issued by the Head of Service, removing House Officers and NYSC doctors from scheme of service had an addendum circular from National Salaries and Wages Commission to clarify that they will continue to earn the wages attached to them on their present wage structure.\n\n\u201cI request that the agreement reached in the meetings of 20th and 21st August captured in the MOU which I have seen be religiously implemented,\u201d he added.\n\nTo further improve the health sector, the President said budgetary allocations had been increased and a Health Sector Reform Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Vice President, had been commissioned to identify and address weaknesses in the Health System and align with global best practices that raise public confidence.\n\n\u201cWe are also supporting initiatives to expand health insurance coverage and bring more resources to health financing. We have many more challenges ahead and much more to do, for our large population.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, it is important to remind you that, as senior medical personnel and representatives of one of the most respected professional groups in the world, your responsibility for the health and wellbeing of Nigerians is clear.\n\n\u201cIt does not end only with the welfare of your members, but continues with a sense of responsibility for the entire country and its sociopolitical health and national stability.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s source of revenue over many years was dwindling, with a rising population.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe global economy has been seriously affected by the pandemic, and despite recent pleasing news of more than five per cent economic growth of Nigeria in the last quarter, we are still having fiscal challenges to deal with, like most other countries.\n\n\u201cThe source of revenue that Nigeria has depended on for so long experienced global decline, our population is rising fast and the tension arising from both is fueling agitation among our youth. Organisations like the NMA could play a very useful moderating role in society.\u201d\n\nThe President lauded the positive role the Nigeria Medical Association had been playing, as the apex professional medical association in Nigeria, especially with regard to the ongoing industrial action.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is a befitting role for the NMA, as a mature organisation, led by responsible members with long experience.\n\n\u201cI am proud also to learn of various feats that have been achieved in our hospitals, like the separation of conjoined twins and also the valiant efforts of our health personnel in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, much of which has earned us recognition at home and abroad, and the recent appointment of one of your colleagues as Assistant Director General of the World Health Organisation. We again warmly congratulate Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu for his elevation.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said the NMA had been playing a critical role in the development of the health sector, particularly in tackling pandemics, participating in policy formulation and population health.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the NMA President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, thanked the President for appointment of members into strategic positions in government, assent to the Medical Residency Act and immunisation coverage.\n\nAccording to him, the association \u201cis concerned by the industrial action\u201d embarked upon by doctors, and had been doing its best to alleviate the suffering of patients across the country, while appealing for an urgent resolution.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for providing takeoff grant for the Federal University of Health Sciences in Otukpo, Benue State, Azare, Bauchi State and Ila Orangun, Osun State while also suggesting an appropriate funding module for the new institutions.\n\nHe assured the President of the continuous support of members of the association to improve health in the country.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora.",

Bush, the nation\u2019s leader on 9/11, is due at the Pennsylvania memorial and his successor, Barack Obama, at ground zero. The only other post-9/11 U.S. president, Donald Trump, is planning to be in New York, in addition to providing commentary at a boxing match in Florida in the evening.\n\nOther observances \u2014 from a wreath-laying in Portland, Maine, to a fire engine parade in Guam \u2014 are planned across a country now full of 9/11 plaques, statues and commemorative gardens.\n\nUsing hijacked planes as missiles, the assailants inflicted the deadliest terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, taking nearly 3,000 lives, toppling the twin towers and ushering in an age of fear.\n\nSecurity was redefined, with changes to airport checkpoints, police practices and the government\u2019s surveillance powers. In the years that followed, virtually any sizeable explosion, crash or act of violence seemed to raise a dire question: \u201cIs it terrorism?\u201d Some ideological violence and plots did follow, though federal officials and the public have lately become increasingly concerned with threats from domestic extremists after years of focusing on international terror groups in the wake of 9/11.\n\nNew York faced questions early on about whether it could ever recover from the blow to its financial hub and restore a feeling of safety among the crowds and skyscrapers. New Yorkers ultimately rebuilt a more populous and prosperous city but had to reckon with the tactics of an empowered post-9/11 police department and a widened gap between haves and have-nots.\n\nA \u201cwar on terror\u201d led to invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the longest U.S. war ended last month with a hasty, massive airlift punctuated by a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 American service members and was attributed to a branch of the Islamic State extremist group. The U.S. is now concerned that al-Qaida, the terror network behind 9/11, may regroup in Afghanistan.\n\nTwo decades after helping to triage and treat injured colleagues at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, retired Army Col. Malcolm Bruce Westcott is saddened and frustrated by the continued threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI always felt that my generation, my military cohort, would take care of it \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t pass it on to anybody else,\u201d said Westcott, of Greensboro, Georgia. \u201cAnd we passed it on.\u201d\n\nFor Angelique Tung, who was at the trade center for a business meeting on 9/11 and escaped down 77 flights of stairs, the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan stirred empathy for troops who served there. Some now wonder whether their efforts and sacrifices made a difference, which makes Tung think of a question she has asked herself since surviving Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cI hope that, after 20 years, other people are asking that question: What good can come from this?\u201d said Tung, of Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nSept. 11 propelled a surge of shared grief and common purpose, but it soon gave way.\n\nMuslim Americans endured suspicion, surveillance and hate crimes. The quest to understand the catastrophic toll of the terror attacks prompted changes in building design and emergency communications, but it also spurred conspiracy theories that seeded a culture of skepticism. Schisms and resentments grew over immigration, the balance between tolerance and vigilance, the meaning of patriotism, the proper way to honor the dead, and the scope of a promise to \u201cnever forget.\u201d\n\nTrinidad was 10 when she overheard her dad, Michael, saying goodbye to her mother by phone from the burning trade center. She remembers the pain but also the fellowship of the days that followed, when all of New York \u201cfelt like it was family.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when I feel like the world is so divided, I just wish that we can go back to that,\u201d said Trinidad, of Orlando, Florida. \u201cI feel like it would have been such a different world if we had just been able to hang on to that feeling.\u201d",
