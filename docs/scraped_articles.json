          "title": "Why babies should be allowed to suck for decent minutes before switching to another breast \u2014Paediatrician",
          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nA Consultant Paediatrician, Dr. Abdurrazzaq Alege, has urged nursing mothers to ensure babies spend a minimum of 15 minutes sucking one breast before being switched to the other breast.\n\nAccording to him, doing this will help to ensure the baby gets the necessary nutrients needed for optimal growth and development.\n\nHe explained that while some children get satisfied after 15 minutes of feeding, the mother should offer the second breast and not assume the baby is satisfied until the infant refuses the breast.\n\nThe paediatrician further explained that \u201cThe essence of having to stay that long on the breast is to allow the child to get the necessary nutrients, otherwise, if you put the child to breastfeed for less than five minutes, basically what the child will get is just water to quench thirst.\n\n\u201cThe child may not grow because he is not taking what is necessary for optimal development.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview, the paediatrician who works at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina, Nephrology Division, explained that breast milk is divided into two parts, the foremilk and hindmilk.\n\nHe noted that when a child is being breastfed, the first thing that comes out is the foremilk which contains just water, adding that the hindmilk which contains the nutrients that the child needs come later.\n\n\u201c70 per cent of the breast milk is water. We always tell new mothers that when engaging in exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months; the child is not expected to take a single drop of water because we know that 70 per cent of the breastmilk is water. So even if you think the child is thirsty, give breast milk.\n\n\u201cHowever, It is the hindmilk that comes later that contains the nutrients the child will use like, proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins. The major content is protein because it is the one that is necessary to build the body of the baby.\n\n\u201cWhat the child needs at that stage is bodybuilding to grow,\u201d the expert noted.\n\nHe noted that nursing mothers also benefit from spending longer time feeding the child.\n\n\u201cThe first benefit is is what we call bonding. When the child is breastfeeding, the child will be looking at the mother\u2019s face. It allows and encourages compassion. It helps to build an emotional attachment between the mother and the child.\n\nHe explained that the bonding time can also help in detecting jaundice.\n\n\u201cIf you try to open the eyes of a newborn, it is usually difficult.\n\n\u201cPart of the problems with newborns is jaundice. It starts in the eyes. The white parts start to get yellow and when we want to check, it is usually difficult because when you try to open the eye, the child will forcefully close it.\n\n\u201cBut the first person to tell about jaundice is usually the mother because anytime the child is breastfeeding, he is looking at the mother\u2019s face so in a way, it helps in detecting jaundice.\u201d\n\nThe paediatrician explained further that another benefit of long breastfeeding is that it allows good contraction of the womb, in the first few weeks for the newly delivered mothers.\n\n\u201cGood breastfeeding and long breastfeeding, especially exclusive breastfeeding, allow the womb to get back to shape,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA mother that is giving water and other things to the baby will not give so much time to breastfeeding and this will not allow her uterus, the womb to contract well and get back to shape.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, breastfeeding mothers will feel uterine contraction each time the child is feeding, adding that some of them will feel like they are in labour when the uterus is contracting and trying to get back to normal.\n\n\u201cSo proper breastfeeding allows a good return to the pre-pregnancy abdominal state, which is the size of the abdomen before pregnancy,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, \u201cBreastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival.\u201d\n\nThe WHO, however, noted that nearly two out of three infants are not exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months \u2014 a rate that has not improved in two decades.\n\n\u201cBreast milk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies that help protect against many common childhood illnesses.\n\n\u201cBreast milk provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child\u2019s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one third during the second year of life.\n\n\u201cBreastfed children perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese and less prone to diabetes later in life.\n\n\u201cWomen who breastfeed also have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers,\u201d the global health agency said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

We also call on Nigerian Christians in diaspora to join us using our embassies all over the world.\n\n\u201cThe occasion can also be used to pray for Deborah\u2019s family and friends, peace for the country, victory for the Church and godly political leaders in the coming general election.\u201d",

The wife of the shop owner and his children as well as some buyers present at the time of the accident were said to have escaped unhurt.\n\nConfirming the accident, a member of the JTF at the roadblock, who pleaded anonymity, said that Inspector Yusuf was travelling to Dengi in Plateau State with five others, adding that the policeman was driving at high speed.\n\n\u201cYes, a police officer who works with the Jigawa State command had an accident here. The officer was travelling to Dengi in Plateau State with five others. He was on high speed really. He seems not to be aware of the roadblock here and it was raining here too.\n\n\u201cThe police officer and others in the car were very lucky to have escaped from the incident. In fact, the accident was very fatal. Their narrow escape is from God,\u201d the military officer said.\n\nHe, however, said no life was lost in the solo accident, adding that the victims only sustained varying degrees of injuries.\n\n\u201cThere was no loss of life except the occupants of the vehicle sustained injuries but were quickly rushed to Boi Primary Health Care for medical attention.\n\n\u201cThe accident destroyed a provision shop owned by Manigat Silas, a resident of the area whose wife and her children including some buyers too were not hurt,\u201d the military personnel said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in charge of Bogoro LGA, Mr Babale, while reacting to the accident advised motorists to always avoid overspeeding and also abide by other traffic rules and regulations.\n\nAccording to him, this would ensure that when an accident eventually occurs, the fatality rate would be minimal.\n\nBabale further urged residents to avoid doing business and erecting shops close to highways with a view to avoiding fatalities in cases of road accidents.",

          "text": "Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has begged Lagos Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for support towards becoming the presidential candidate of his party.\n\nThe PDP presidential aspirant made the appeal in Lagos during a consultation parley with the party leaders, executive, delegates and members of the opposition party.\n\nHe said he has what it takes to lead the country but needed all the votes of the chapter\u2019s delegates to emerge the winner of his party\u2019s presidential primary slated for May 28 and 29, 2022.\n\nThe aspirant, who was accompanied by Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke among other party chieftains promised to give everyone fair representation if he emerges the winner of the primary.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have come to Lagos state as somebody who is committed and sincere, to beg you for your votes during our forthcoming presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cYou all know that I have been a constant party member having joined since 1998. I am not like some that are not stable has brought misfortune to our party.\n\n\u201cOur party was not in the opposition before. We were the ruling party. But, some who are now canvassing for your votes mismanaged our party and that made us to lose in 2015.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give power to those who will use the opportunity to form another party.\n\n\u201cEven if I don\u2019t win the ticket, I will support whoever emerges. It is not about man-know-man, it is about who can win election for the PDP. Simple!\n\n\u201cIt is not about story, but who has the capacity to face the APC. I have the capacity to win election for the PDP.\n\n\u201cI will not run away. I will face APC squarely. They tried it in Rivers and they failed.\n\n\u201cIf you give me this ticket on May 28 and 29, my people, go and sleep with your two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cI have been tested on different fronts and the evidence is there.\n\n\u201cI am running to be president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But to do this, we must secure the country, her citizens and her property.\n\nI am ready to ensure protection of lives and property, first, he assured.\n\n\u201cWe need a firm, focused and forthright leader, who will stand up to these challenges. And it is only a strong person like me and not a lily-livered person, who can\u2019t stand the government.\n\n\u201cSome people will come and tell you theory. Some people will say they left so much money in government coffers when there were problems. Why leaving much money in the coffers, when you were elected to solve problems?\n\n\u201cThe energy in me is too much and I want to serve Nigeria. I am strong. My job is to stay and work and let Nigeria be better. I have the intellect to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Governor who boosted to know the ruling party too well, pleaded:\u201dLet me tell you that I depend on the Southwest to become the presidential candidate of our party. If this zone gives me its vote, I have won the election already.\n\nHe urged the state chapter to give honour to the party leaders and avoid division within.\n\n\u201cLeadership is not only the national working committee. There are other leaders and workers in the party.\n\nI believe from today, I won\u2019t hear any problem in the party in the state.\n\n\u201cLet us give honour to whom honour is due. The working committee coming should from time to time engage the leader, Chief Bode George, who has paid his dues. Do your part and we will support you and you\u2019ll win next election in the state.\n\n\u201cMy presidency will not be a dump presidency, it will be lively and most engaging\u201d.",

You must have peace for investors to come in, for people to set up industries. So the basic thing in my first six months as president of Nigeria is to end banditry.\n\n\u201cAll those bandits, let them wait for me. I will pursue them. It is my job. I will provide to security agencies whatever they require.\u201d\n\nWike in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said the country yearned for a strong, courageous and fearless leader like him to resolve the ongoing security.\n\nThe Governor told the delegates that he was the only presidential aspirant that had never defected from the PDP since its formation in 1998 to another political party.\n\nHe urged the delegates to be circumspect as some of those vying for the PDP presidential ticket were among those, who aligned with the APC to defeat the party in 2015.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, we are suffering. We are in opposition. Who are those who plotted against us? Who are those who masterminded for us to lose the 2015 election?\n\n\u201cToday, we are crying that we are in opposition, today we are fighting how to take back power. Who are those people who took the power that PDP had and gave it to APC. You know them.\u201d\n\nWike said he remained committed to the ideals of PDP and would never leave the party for another political party under any circumstances.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhether I win the ticket or not, I will never leave PDP. I will support PDP, I will make sure PDP wins the election. I am not those when anything happens they run away from the party. I will not leave this party because everything I am today, it is PDP that has given it to me. So I owe PDP a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said he was not seeking the office of the president for personal aggrandisement insisting that he was willing to work for emergence of a new egalitarian, united and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria has never been divided the way the country is divided today. Our founding fathers never made mistakes that there should be a country called Nigeria. God never made mistake that there should be a country called Nigeria\u201d, he said.\n\nWike maintained that he remained the only person that could defeat the APC in the 2023 general election if given the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nHe said previous attempts by the APC to rig elections in Rivers State failed and would continue to fail if he emerged the PDP presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cEverywhere, Wike has taken over. Go to the north it\u2019s Wike; go to the east, it\u2019s Wike, go to the west, it\u2019s Wike, go to the south, it\u2019s Wike. Ogun state is Wike.

I truly appreciate the precious and valuable support at the difficult time. It will help me and my fellow Chinese strengthen confidence in defeating the disease. I would like to assure my Nigerian friends that China will be able to win the battle.\n\nAs the highly contagious and latent Omicron variant is sweeping the world, multiple Chinese regions have been overshadowed by the current COVID-19 resurgence. But China has been rising to the challenge.\n\nThrough a resolute and full implementation of the dynamic zero-COVID approach, and with the whole-hearted support of the Chinese people, Shenzhen in southern China resumed normal work and production in late March as the resurgence subsides, while community transmission has been cut in Jilin Province since mid-April. Racing against time, Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing, and has grasped the basic picture of hidden transmission in society. Data shows the epidemic situation is steadily improving and under effective control in Shanghai. Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen from a peak of 27,000 to 3,000 at the time of writing , and nearly two-thirds of the infections have recovered in the city. Over 70 percent of Shanghai\u2019s 1,800-plus major enterprises have resumed work and production, and the resumption rate of the first batch of more than 660 key industrial enterprises in the city has exceeded 90 percent.\n\nChina\u2019s anti-epidemic experience has demonstrated that its dynamic zero-COVID policy is not only the best option but also the bottom line that must be maintained for the country\u2019s current epidemic prevention and control work.\n\nYet, the country\u2019s effective anti-pandemic efforts such as temporary lockdowns, brief closures of factories and stores, and suspension of offline classes in schools, have been repeatedly questioned by a number of Western media outlets as being excessively strict. While it is undeniably true that halting normal production can be costly, it is also true that the virus kills.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has claimed over 6 million lives. In sharp contrast, the death toll was about 5,000 on the Chinese mainland.\n\nBy pursuing the dynamic zero-COVID approach, China has managed to safeguard people\u2019s lives and well-being and has minimized the epidemic\u2019s impact on economic and social development to the largest extent.\n\nThe stringent anti-epidemic measures inevitably lead to short-term economic pains, but dynamic zero-COVID is overall a counter-epidemic policy that ensures economic development.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, China\u2019s GDP increased by 4.8 percent year on year. Against the backdrop of global inflation, domestic prices remain steady. The value of goods trade in the period rose 10.7 percent. China\u2019s major industrial firms saw their profits up 8.5 percent year on year.\n\nAs a result, it is not difficult to conclude that China\u2019s dynamic zero-COVID policy complements and bolsters the normal operation of the economy and society. The policy has woven a strong safety net for the 1.4 billion Chinese people.\n\nHumanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional g hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, China has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.\n\nFrom eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, China is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.\n\n*Chu Maoming is China\u2019s ConsulGeneral in Lagos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*President flays killing, orders thorough, impartial probe of incident\n\n*Victim\u2019s Whatsapp voice note shows alleged blasphemy is false\n\n* Atiku in facebook post, disowns Tweet condemning killing\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) and the British government have condemned the murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, by some fanatical students of the same school for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a Whatsapp post.\n\n\n\nThey are also demanding for the arrest and prosecution of all those responsible for the murder of Deborah, who was attacked and killed by the mob of fanatics that burnt her corpse at the school\u2019s premises last Thursday.\n\nLikewise, President Muhammadu Buhari strongly flayed the resort to self-help by the mob in Sokoto, resulting in violence, destruction and killing of Deborah.\n\n\n\nThe General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, in a statement yesterday said: \u201cThe vampires must be brought to book. The unlawful and dastardly action of the perpetrators must not only be condemned by all right-thinking people but the security operatives must fish them out, prosecute them as it is expected of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the failure of the security agencies and the government to rise up to such criminalities in the past that gave birth to terrorists and bandits. And as long as the State fails to bring these beasts and criminals amidst us to book so also the society will continue to be their killing fields.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the swift reaction of His Eminence, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III who not only condemned the criminal and religious intolerant action but also called on the security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also call on all teachers and preachers of religious intolerance, extremism, and terrorism to repent before the wrath of God descends on them if the State failed to bring them to book. They are agents of death amidst us.\n\n\u201cWe recall the provocative and demeaning advertisement of the Sterling Bank where the bank compared the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to \u201cAgege bread\u201d, up till now, nobody was attacked and even the CAN leadership has accepted the apology tendered by its Managing Director, Abubakar Suleiman.\n\n\n\n\u201cKilling for any God in the name of blasphemy is ungodly, satanic, foolish, reprehensible, and totally unacceptable. This is not a Stone Age and Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Nigeria remains a non-religious State where no religion is supreme to the other.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and commend the restraint of the Christian students of the College who refused to embrace self-help and reprisal attacks on those who murdered their colleague. It is our prayer that those vampires in religious garments will not push the country to a religious war.\n\n\u201cThis is why both the government and the security agencies must stop treating them with kid gloves. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders in a statement by its Chairman, Ejoga Inalegwu, in Kaduna yesterday, called on the government to immediately apprehend and make an example of those who perpetrated the dastardly act.\n\nThe Christian group noted that anything short of apprehending and prosecuting those involved in the heinous act was unacceptable.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, the act was purely a murder in the robe of religion.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe death of Debora Yakubu (Samuel) is one too many by mobs wearing a cloak of religion in the North. In a country where there is a law, nobody, group or individuals has a right to take another\u2019s life whatsoever, outside the due process of law.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the government to make a public example and make a new statement by quickly bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis should not be the usual rhetoric of condemnations and then the case is swept under the carpet with publicised arrests, no prosecution or jaundiced prosecution and letting off the hook, when the outcries die down.\n\n\u201cOne day it is the videoed execution of Christians in the North because of a said killing of a terrorist in Syria, and next what should have been an internal WhatsApp class platform chat results in mob action murder, wearing the robe of religion in our dear North.\u201d\n\nBuhari Flays Killing\n\nThe President, in a reaction to the incident via a release issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the news of the killing of Deborah by fellow students was a matter of concern and demanded an impartial, extensive probe into all that happened before and during the incident.\n\n\n\nHe noted that Muslims all over the world demand respect for the Holy Prophets, including Isah (Alaihissalaam, Jesus Christ) and Muhammad (SAW) but where transgressions occur, as alleged to be the case in this instance, the law does not allow anyone to take matters into their hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders preach that it is not for the believer to judge the actions of another person. The constituted authority must be allowed to deal with such matters when they arise.\n\n\u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,\u201d said the President.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari also directed the Ministries of Information and Culture, Police Affairs and that of Communications and Digital Economy to work with GSM providers and Tech companies to help contain the spread of false and inflammatory information through social media.\n\nHe extended the nation\u2019s condolences to the family of the deceased student and called for tampered comments by the media and calm among the general population while investigation is ongoing to find out the remote and immediate causes of the incident.\n\nBritish Government\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing has condemned the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a tweet yesterday, Laing said the authorities must ensure that the perpetrators of the act are brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI condemn the murder of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, and urge the police and relevant authorities to ensure the perpetrators of this horrific act are made to face justice in line with the law,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTambuwal Meets Sokoto Ulama, Kukah\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has met with a broad spectrum of Muslim leaders in the state to deliberate on the way to maintain peace and harmony amongst its citizens\n\nA statement by his media office said Tambuwal met with Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Mathew Kukah, among others.\n\nThe statement said that the governor had to cut short his various official engagements in Abuja, to rush to Sokoto in view of the importance of the various consultations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Whatsapp Voice Note Shows Alleged Blasphemy is False\n\nThe purported reason Deborah was killed and her body burnt by the mob has been found to be false.\n\nDeborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there.\n\n\n\nShe spoke in Hausa. According to a Twitter user who did the translation, Deborah was quoted to have said: \u201cHoly Ghost Fire, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me, you should know what to be sending to this group, it\u2019s not that the group was created to be sending nonsense, the group was created for posting things like, test, assignment e.t.c. not the nonsense you are posting, no be only prophet, you are coming to play on me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe nonsense she apparently referred to were the religious posts.\n\nHer comments were said to have irked some of her colleagues who felt she disrespected Prophet Mohammed, and threatened to deal with her. When the tension was high, the school authorities took her to the security room to give her some protection. However, the enraged students overpowered the security officers, dragged Deborah out, and beat her until she died before setting her corpse on fire.\n\n\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim also condemned, in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Anyim decried the killing of Deborah as cruel, illegal, callous and inhuman.\n\nAnyim said: \u201cThere is no place in a modern Democracy such as Nigeria for jungle justice and killing of human beings illegally. We cannot afford now to add religious intolerance to the plethora of problems bedevilling our country.\u201d\n\nAtiku Distances Self from Deborah Tweet\n\nPresidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, has distanced himself from a tweet condemning the lynching of Deborah.\n\nAtiku, who is running for President on the platform of the PDP, had taken to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the mob action, saying, \u201cThere cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice-President, however, came under threats from some Muslim northerners who threatened not to vote for him if he emerges as the Presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\n\n\nHowever, Atiku later deleted the tweet amid the threats.\n\nOn Facebook yesterday, the former Vice President in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message. He also stated that any message on social media that did not come with the initials \u201cA. A.\u201d were not his.\n\n\u201cThis evening I received information that a post was made that doesn\u2019t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,\u201d he wrote in Hausa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Ngige backs out as Amaechi, Malami, Akpabio, Onu, Sylva, Ogah, Tallen, Alasoadura, Nwajiuba bow out\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has promised to quickly replace nine members of his cabinet that resigned to contest various elective offices in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this to State House Correspondents shortly after the President held a valedictory meeting with the retiring ministers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe ministers that resigned were: Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice; Godswill Akpabio (Niger Delta Affairs); Rotimi Amaechi (Transportation); Ogbonnaya Onu (Science, Technology and Innovation); Pauline Tallen (Women Affairs); Timipre Sylva (State, Petroleum Resources); Uche Ogar (State, Mines and Steel Development), and Tayo Alasoadura (State, Niger Delta Affairs).\n\n\n\nThough the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige was at the valedictory meeting, he issued a formal statement after the event to say that he had not resigned because he had pulled out of the Presidential race and notified the President.\n\nLai Mohammed at the press briefing announced that Buhari said he would immediately fill the vacancies created by the exodus of the nine ministers.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe ministers will be replaced very soon without delay, he (The President) said so. I don\u2019t know about reshuffling. He said the vacancies would be replaced very soon.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that on Wednesday, Mr. President directed and I informed you that all ministers and other political appointees aspiring to contest for elective offices in 2023 general elections, should resign their current appointments.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis morning, there was a valedictory service for 10 members of the Federal Council who have indicated their desire to aspire for higher offices. Nine of them were present and the 10th was absent with an apology.\n\n\u201cMr. President used the occasion to thank the outgoing members of cabinet for their sacrifices and services. Mr. President also in addition to wishing them success in their endeavour, also expressed the confidence that given the expertise, the experience and what they must have garnered during their years in office, they, like other aspirants, were fully equipped to run the affairs of the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. President also admonished the remaining members of the Cabinet that the journey is still far. And that they should all redouble their efforts, be more diligent and be more committed to the success of the administration. At the end of which the outgoing ministers had a group photograph with Mr. President and also with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if all the ministers had tendered their resignations, he said, \u201cWell. Mr. President said some have and others are in the process of doing so. But he thanked everybody for their compliance.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Ministers can return to their positions if they abruptly change their minds Mohammed noted, \u201cOnly Mr. President can say that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m just sticking to the speech of Mr. President and so I don\u2019t want to speculate what can happen and what cannot happen. But Mr. President\u2019s speech was very clear. He thanked the outgoing ministers for their sacrifice and contribution.\u201d\n\nThe Valedictory Session\n\nAt the valedictory session held at the State House, Abuja, the President assessed the nine outgoing members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and declared that many of them were eminently qualified to succeed him in May, 2023.\n\n\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI am happy to note that a significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. This shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\n\u201dI have no doubt that if the next President emerges from among former members of this cabinet, like any other aspirant, ample competence and outstanding service delivery would be on display. This will be part of our legacies to Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari, who commended the departing public officers for serving the nation sacrificially, \u201dwith dignity and honour\u201d, had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election should resign their current appointments.\n\nHe said: \u201dI note that some have complied while others are in the process of doing so. I would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.\n\n\n\n\u201dI also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members. I wish you success in the upcoming elections and in your future endeavours.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the ministers that looking back as the head of the team over the years, he had fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions and presidential retreats.\n\n\n\nNoting that the departure of some cabinet members had undoubtedly created a vacuum that should be filled, the President said appointments would be made without delay so that the business of governance will not suffer.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Godswill Akpabio, expressed gratitude to the President for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation building.\n\n\u201cAs we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, and administrative sagacity to Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Niger Delta Minister told the President that from his interactions with colleagues, leaving the cabinet was like the story of the Spanish play of \u201csadness and joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cSadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country.\n\n\u201cMay one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on ground. We have seen and know your vision. We know where you want the country to be.\u201d\n\nNwajiuba, who had earlier tendered his resignation, was not present at the valedictory session.\n\n\n\nNgige Backs Out\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige has formally pulled out of the 2023 presidential race.\n\nIn a statement signed by Ngige, he said: \u201cHaving also consulted widely with my family, constituents, supporters and well-wishers, it is my pleasure to announce the withdrawal of my interest and earlier decision to contest the office of the President in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, I will not be participating in any of the internal party processes of the said election, starting with the primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cI took this momentous decision firstly in the overall interest of the nation, in order to enable me concentrate on my job, and assist the President and the government weather the difficult last lap, in the life of the administration and secondly for other family reasons.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have since communicated this decision to the President and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\nNgige also said his constituents, political associates and well-wishers across the country are by this statement informed of his latest decision, which also has the blessing and support of the overwhelming majority, hence supersedes any other interest, personal or otherwise.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some religious extremists in Borno State have threatened to kill a young woman, identified as Naomi Goni, after claiming that she allegedly insulted Prophet Muhammad (SAW) on Facebook.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that championing the threat is one Abdulmajid Tanko Izge who claimed to be the President of a group, Borno Youth Support.\n\n\n\nHe vowed that the death penalty was the punishment that would be meted out to Naomi.\n\nThe threat by the Borno extremists comes while the country has yet to resolve the gruesome murder of a 200-level Shehu Shagari College of Education student in Sokoto State, Deborah Samuel, last Thursday by a Muslim mob which comprised of her classmates.\n\n\n\nThe incident has continued to attract nationwide condemnation and the police have arrested two suspects \u2013 although a protest by some Muslim youths over the arrest on Saturday turned violent in the state and forced Governor Aminu Tambuwal to impose a 24-hour curfew.\n\nIn the Borno episode, SaharaReporters learnt that the police had taken Naomi Goni into custody over the death threats by the Jihadists.\n\nWriting partly in Hausa, Tanko Izge said, \u201cA message to Government of Borno State. Akwai wata yarinya me suna Naomi Goni wanda tayi batanci ga manzo Allah wanda hakan a musulunci kisa ne hukunci Ko da soho ne koda musulmi ne ya kafurta. Dan haka muna kira ga gwamnatin Borno tayi gaggawan daukan mataki inhar ba haka ba kuma mu musulmai baza muyi bacci ba kuma zamu dauka da kanmu (There is a girl named Naomi Goni who insulted the Messenger of Allah (saw) and in Islam it is a death sentence even if it is a Muslim. We therefore call on the Borno State Government to take immediate action or else we Muslims will not sleep and we will take action).\u201d\n\nHe made the post on his Facebook as seen by SaharaReporters.\n\nHe added, \u201cNaomi you must face the consequences. We will continue raising our voice until action is taken. #Findnaomigoni.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Gaskiya Tura yakai Bango A gari Irin Borno wata Ta Zage ma aiki Amma gwamnati Bawani feed Back. Zuciyana yana Tapasa I will surely come for protest.! (In fact, the government has not yet commented on the situation. My heart is pounding I will surely come for protest).\u201d\n\nA check on Facebook also showed some northerners calling for her death.\n\n\u201cThe punishment for blasphemy is death! in most religions including Christianity. Respect people\u2019s religion. It\u2019s simple,\u201d one Farouq Umar Farouq wrote.\n\nAnother Facebook user identified as Ja'afar M A Baggo said, \u201cAllah tsinewa duk wanda yasa hannu a wajen bata kariya ko wace iri ce. Allah ya rugurgusa duk wanda ke da niya/burin kare wannan la'ananniyar bakar arniyar. Don Allah ku kashe ta mutanen Maiduguri. (God condemns anyone who engages in anything of this kind. May God destroy anyone who intends to protect this damn evil lady. Please the people of Maiduguri should kill her.)\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a security source said Naomi had been taken into custody by the police.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s currently under detention and denied making the post; she said her account was hacked after she gave birth last year. I don\u2019t think she will be released soon so she won\u2019t be killed. I heard some people are also planning to attack her father\u2019s house here in Maiduguri.\u201d",

It is very important,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, we have found ourselves in a similar situation because the APC government has been a one-sided government and therefore, there is disunity, because of disunity now we are facing insecurity all over the country.\n\n\u201cThat was why in my declaration speech, I said number one item for me is to make sure I unify this country.\n\n\u201cI will give a sense of belonging to each and every part of this country; I\u2019ll give a sense of belonging to every ethnic group; I\u2019ll give a sense of belonging to every religious group. After unifying the country, then we tackle the insecurity.\n\n\u201cUnless we restore law and order and peace, we cannot do anything. After restoring security generally, we will now go to the economy. We have the experience. We took Nigeria from the bottom to the highest economy in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow APC has taken us down to the bottom, top to bottom. That is why I just can\u2019t understand how somebody can vote for APC in this country because we have suffered and we are suffering.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the delegates and stakeholders to rally around the PDP to ensure the party is united as the 2023 elections draw near.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPDP must unite to win this time. It does not matter the outcome of the convention.

Not because we have not instituted institutions during PDP to make sure there is enough funding for these institutions.\n\n\u201cBut because they are stealing the money. I will make sure nobody steals public money, I swear.\n\n\u201cAfter dealing with education, we can now look at restructuring the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPC RUNNING \u2018ONE-SIDED GOVERNMENT\u2019\n\nAtiku said the APC has taken the country \u201cfrom top to bottom\u201d, and the people keep suffering.\n\nHe accused the ruling party of being a one-sided government, saying this has caused disunity in the country.\n\n\u201cCan you govern without uniting people and bringing peace? It is very important,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, we have found ourselves in a similar situation because the APC government has been a one-sided government and therefore, there is disunity, because of disunity now we are facing insecurity all over the country.\n\n\u201cThat was why in my declaration speech, I said number one item for me is to make sure I unify this country.\n\n\u201cI will give a sense of belonging to each and every part of this country; I\u2019ll give a sense of belonging to every ethnic group; I\u2019ll give a sense of belonging to every religious group. After unifying the country, then we tackle the insecurity.\n\n\u201cUnless we restore law and order and peace, we cannot do anything. After restoring security generally, we will now go to the economy. We have the experience. We took Nigeria from the bottom to the highest economy in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow APC has taken us down to the bottom, top to bottom. That is why I just can\u2019t understand how somebody can vote for APC in this country because we have suffered and we are suffering.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the delegates and stakeholders to rally around the PDP to ensure the party is united as the 2023 elections draw near.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPDP must unite to win this time. It does not matter the outcome of the convention. Let us unite and win,\u201d Atiku said.\n\n\u201cWe have been in opposition for eight years, we cannot afford to be in opposition for another eight years.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN. Given that 71 million Nigerians have their NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVNs \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of free transactions, the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacked by Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, and more, the company also announces a partnership with the Central African Republic to become its official crypto partner and advisor to the President\n\nMARA, a Pan-African crypto exchange, launched today and announced $23 million in funding from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, TQ Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, Huobi Ventures, Day One Ventures, Infinite Capital, DAO Jones (investment DAO backed by Mike Shinoda, Steve Aoki and Disclosure), and nearly 100 other crypto investors, and angels including Amit Bhatia and Hamad Alhoimaizi.\n\nIn addition, MARA has also announced a partnership with the Central African Republic, which just passed a bill legalizing Bitcoin as legal tender. As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy. MARA\u2019s executive team includes former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, NVIDIA, Founders Bank, Rappi, and more. The company raised a total of $23M from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, TQ Ventures, Day One Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, KuCoin Ventures, Huobi Ventures and nearly 100 other\n\ncrypto investors and angels.

          "title": "SEC bypasses public to issue crypto regulation in Nigeria",
          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday released a new regulation for the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria.\n\nWhile it is the first of its kind in Africa, the SEC regulation is coming without an exposure draft. Usually, important guidelines like the New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms, and Custody of Digital Assets as the regulation is titled, are preceded by an exposure draft.\n\nAn exposure draft is an early version of a document that has been released to the public for comments. Following a sufficient period of time for public comments to be received and further consideration by the originator of the document, a final version is released.\n\nSources told BusinessDay that the SEC had invited some stakeholders to deliberate on the regulations. However, while the market was expecting an exposure draft to be made public first, the SEC has now issued final regulations.\n\nBusinessDay learned that the SEC had a draft that was shared with a few stakeholders including select crypto exchanges for comments. However, it did not make the draft public before releasing the final regulations on Friday.\n\nExperts also ask whether banks can now deal with crypto-related businesses given that some of the requirements can only be accomplished through banks. For banks to deal with crypto-related entities will only be possible if the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) gives them the go-ahead, which will mean the restrictions placed on the market have been lifted.\n\nThe regulation for example requires that applicants pay N100,000 for the filing or application fee, N300,000 for the processing fee, N30 million for the registration fee, and N100,000 for sponsored individuals fee. These fees are to be paid in a bank account operated by the SEC.\n\nFollowing the restrictions placed by the CBN, bank accounts owned by crypto-related banks were closed on the directive of the apex bank. The CBN had gone as far as ordering banks to monitor transactions of individuals it considered crypto-exposed and close such accounts.\n\n\u201cHow would we pay for the SEC registration fees?\u201d asked an executive of one of the crypto exchanges.\n\nAlthough the CBN appears not to be bulging from the ban it placed in February 2021, BusinessDay recently reported that the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) was putting together a piece of regulation for virtual assets service providers.\n\nAccording to sources who spoke to BusinessDay, In February 2022, stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain and crypto industry were invited by an NFIU-led Virtual Assets Workstream over a National Assessment Risk (NRA).\n\nThe NFIU, an autonomous unit domiciled within the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is the central national agency responsible for the receipt of disclosures from reporting organisations, the analysis of these disclosures, and the production of intelligence for dissemination to competent authorities.\n\nThe draft proposals follow the threat of sanction by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) if Nigeria fails to improve its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT) regulations before October 2022.\n\nIt is also possible that the SEC may have accelerated the release of the regulation in response to the FATF threat.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria\u2019s 10.7 million users boost fintech ambition\n\nNonetheless, Owen Odia, Country Manager for Nigeria at Luno, one of the global cryptocurrency exchanges in Nigeria, sees the SEC regulation as a positive step for the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria. According to her, the new regulations could mark a major breakthrough in not only delivering much-needed clarity and protection for crypto customers but also for businesses.\n\n\u201cSince launching in Nigeria in 2015, we\u2019ve always prided ourselves on consistently adopting an open and proactive approach towards regulation and with the SEC\u2019s new framework, our hope is that our current and potential users will have even greater confidence to trust us with their funds as we strengthen our push to raise the standards of our industry,\u201d Odia said.\n\nLuno currently has over 3 million customers in Nigeria and secures an average of more than 4,000 downloads of its app per day in the country alone. The company said it is registered with the NFIU and adheres to stringent Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering processes in all of its 40 operating countries.\n\n\u201cWe are well-aware that regulators such as the SEC share this same mission; however, we are also conscious that this is by no means an easy task for them. They have to get to grips with a new technology that very few are yet to understand but it is for this reason why they should continue to collaborate with industry players over the coming months and years.\u201d",

Olubukola Saraki in the state.\n\nThe governor hosted Saraki, who is a presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the Government House on Saturday, in Benin City.\n\nSaraki is to meet with PDP delegates in the state after the courtesy call on the governor.\n\nThe former Senate said Nigeria must be rescued and fixed, noting: \u201cWe know there is a problem in this country. We know that the country needs to be rescued and fixed. We can\u2019t just vote for any kind of leader. We don\u2019t have the luxury of just voting anybody come 2023 because the situation we find ourselves in is severe.\n\n\u201cThe country needs leaders that understand the issues. PDP is the only party today that can give direction for this nation. We have a lot of aspirants at this time that want to be president of this country. Some are more qualified than others.\u201d\n\nSaraki assured that if he is elected as president of Nigeria, he will focus on the housing sector, ensuring the provision of affordable housing units for low-income earners.\n\n\u201cWe would focus on providing housing units for low-income earners. The housing sector will stimulate the economy, create jobs for the youths and improve lives for the people.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to have vocational training for about one million people and stop importing workers in the housing sector. We need to create jobs for the people here in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nSaraki extolled the leadership qualities of Governor Obaseki, noting that he has brought a lot of energy to the party and also the right kind of attitude needed to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cWe must commend him on the registration drive of the party despite the litigation. He has put in more effort and has given us direction in moving the party forward.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of leader we need for the PDP going forward. The governor is a key stakeholder in this party and the country. He understands the issues; he knows what he is talking about. What he thinks is important to aspirants like us. I had a good private discussion with him.

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Three other employees of the store, part of a regional chain, were wounded but are expected to survive, authorities said.\n\nStephen Belongia, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Buffalo field office, said the attack would be investigated both as a hate crime and as an act of \u201cracially motivated violent extremism\u201d under federal law.\n\n\u201cThis person was pure evil,\u201d Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, his voice quaking with emotion. \u201cIt was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.\u201d\n\nThe suspect was expected to make his first court appearance to face murder charges by day\u2019s end, officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is a day of great pain for our community,\u201d Buffalo Mayor Bryon Brown told reporters. \u201cMany of us have been in and out of this supermarket many times. \u2026 We cannot let this hateful person divide our community or our country.\u201d\n\nBrown said he had received calls from the White House and New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James.\n\nU.S. Representative Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the attack appeared to be the work of a violent white supremacist.\n\n\u201cWe must pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, without delay,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.",

          "text": "BREAKING: Jihadists In Borno Plot To Kill Another Young Woman For Alleged Blasphemy, Post Death Threats On Facebook\n\nSome religious extremists in Borno State have threatened to kill a young woman named Naomi Goni, accusing her of insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW) on Facebook.\n\nNEWS DIRECT has learned that one Abdulmajid Tanko Izge, who claims to be the President of a group called Borno Youth Support, is supporting the threat.\n\nHe promised Naomi that she would receive the death penalty.\n\nThe threat from Borno radicals comes as the country continues to grapple with the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level Shehu Shagari College of Education student in Sokoto State, by a Muslim mob made up of her classmates last Thursday.\n\nThe incident has continued to attract nationwide condemnation and the police have arrested two suspects \u2013 although a protest by some Muslim youths over the arrest on Saturday turned violent in the state and forced Governor Aminu Tambuwal to impose a 24-hour curfew.\n\nIn the Borno episode, SaharaReporters learnt that the police had taken Naomi Goni into custody over the death threats by the Jihadists.\n\nWriting partly in Hausa, Tanko Izge said, \u201cA message to Government of Borno State. Akwai wata yarinya me suna Naomi Goni wanda tayi batanci ga manzo Allah wanda hakan a musulunci kisa ne hukunci Ko da soho ne koda musulmi ne ya kafurta. Dan haka muna kira ga gwamnatin Borno tayi gaggawan daukan mataki inhar ba haka ba kuma mu musulmai baza muyi bacci ba kuma zamu dauka da kanmu (There is a girl named Naomi Goni who insulted the Messenger of Allah (saw) and in Islam it is a death sentence even if it is a Muslim. We therefore call on the Borno State Government to take immediate action or else we Muslims will not sleep and we will take action).\u201d\n\nHe made the post on his Facebook as seen by SaharaReporters.\n\nHe added, \u201cNaomi you must face the consequences. We will continue raising our voice until action is taken. #Findnaomigoni.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Gaskiya Tura yakai Bango A gari Irin Borno wata Ta Zage ma aiki Amma gwamnati Bawani feed Back. Zuciyana yana Tapasa I will surely come for protest.! (In fact, the government has not yet commented on the situation. My heart is pounding I will surely come for protest).\u201d\n\nA check on Facebook also showed some northerners calling for her death.\n\n\u201cThe punishment for blasphemy is death! in most religions including Christianity. Respect people\u2019s religion. It\u2019s simple,\u201d one Farouq Umar Farouq wrote.\n\nAnother Facebook user identified as Ja\u2019afar M A Baggo said, \u201cAllah tsinewa duk wanda yasa hannu a wajen bata kariya ko wace iri ce. Allah ya rugurgusa duk wanda ke da niya/burin kare wannan la\u2019ananniyar bakar arniyar. Don Allah ku kashe ta mutanen Maiduguri. (God condemns anyone who engages in anything of this kind. May God destroy anyone who intends to protect this damn evil lady. Please the people of Maiduguri should kill her.)\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a security source said Naomi had been taken into custody by the police.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s currently under detention and denied making the post; she said her account was hacked after she gave birth last year. I don\u2019t think she will be released soon so she won\u2019t be killed. I heard some people are also planning to attack her father\u2019s house here in Maiduguri.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nAssociation of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has developed a roadmap campaign plan needed to save the naira from further decline and enhance exchange rate stability.\n\nThe ABCON National Executive Council said the move to save the naira was agreed by the body at the conclusion of its meeting in Lagos, where it unveiled strategies for save the local currency, bridge the exchange rate gaps and curb volatility in the forex market.\n\nThe naira exchanges at N596 to dollar at the parallel market and N415.83 to dollar at the official market creating a rate gap of N180.17 per dollar.\n\nThe ABCON President, Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe said there was urgent need to enhance dollar liquidity in the market and ensure stability of prices in the economy.\n\nThese steps, he said would save the local currency and economy from the impact of election spending that has kept inflation at double digits for a very long time.\n\nThe ABCON boss disclosed that the depreciation of the naira against global currencies was due to pressure from rising dollar demand without sufficient liquidity to meet the demands from retail end users, manufacturers and other key players in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe naira has consistently come under serious pressure due to dollar scarcity making it difficult for forex end users, manufacturers and key industry players to access dollar needed to meet their needs. ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market. The suggested the strengthening of over 4,500 BDCs to bring forex closer to the retail end users and boost market liquidity.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

          "text": "Finland on Saturday sought to allay Moscow\u2019s fears about its bid to join NATO, as fierce fighting raged in Ukraine\u2019s east, slowing a Russian advance.\n\nWives and parents of Ukrainian fighters trapped in the bowels of a besieged steel plant in the country\u2019s south meanwhile made a desperate appeal to China to help secure their release.\n\nAnd the wealthy countries of the G7 vowed to further turn the screw on the Kremlin with fresh sanctions, pledging never to recognise the borders it is attempting to redraw through destructive force.\n\nOne of Europe\u2019s fiercest conflicts since World War II has seen more than six million people flee for their lives, and according to Kyiv has caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to civilian infrastructure.\n\nREAD ALSO: Russia Suspends Electricity To Finland\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin urged his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu to move immediately to implement a ceasefire, in their first talks since before the conflict began on February 24.\n\nBut one senior Ukrainian general predicted a turning point in the months ahead, and said the fighting could be over by the end of the year.\n\nIn Turin, Italy, a world away from the fighting, a wave of popular support has made Ukraine\u2019s Kalush Orchestra the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to triumph at the world\u2019s biggest live music event \u2014 the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nBut even there the war has cast a shadow.\n\n\u201cWe have one band member who joined the territorial defence of Kyiv on the third day of the war,\u201d said lead singer Oleh Psiuk.\n\n\u201cWe are very worried about him, and we hope to see him safe once we are back.\u201d\n\nPhone call\n\nFinland and Sweden are poised to jettison decades of military non-alignment to join NATO as a defence against feared further aggression from Russia.\n\nMoscow has warned Finland, with whom it shares a 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border, that it would take \u201creciprocal steps\u201d.\n\nFinland\u2019s grid operator said Russia halted electricity supplies overnight, though Finnish officials said power supplied by Sweden had made up for the losses.\n\nAhead of talks with NATO members in Berlin, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was \u201cconfident that in the end we will find a solution and Finland (and) Sweden will become members of NATO\u201d.\n\nEarlier, in a phone call initiated by Helsinki, President Sauli Niinisto had a \u201cdirect and straightforward\u201d conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cAvoiding tensions was considered important,\u201d Niinisto\u2019s office said.\n\nPutin, however, told him that Finland joining NATO would be a \u201cmistake\u201d, insisting that Russia posed \u201cno threat to Finland\u2019s security\u201d, the Kremlin said.\n\nFinland\u2019s bid to join NATO is expected to be announced this weekend.\n\nTurkey unhappy\n\nFinland and Sweden will first have to win over NATO member Turkey on the sidelines of the informal gathering of the alliance\u2019s foreign ministers in Berlin.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said he opposed their membership bids and accused both countries of harbouring \u201cterrorist organisations\u201d.\n\nBoth Nordic countries have sizable Kurdish populations. Ankara has regularly accused Stockholm in particular of harbouring members of the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been designated a terrorist organisation in the UK, European Union and the United States.\n\nIt has also been angered by Sweden\u2019s assertion that the mass killings of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917 constituted genocide.\n\nBut Turkey on Saturday expressed readiness at least to discuss Finnish and Swedish membership.\n\n\u201cA big majority of the Turkish people are against the membership of those countries who are supporting PKK terrorist organisation,\u201d Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said upon arrival for the Berlin talks.\n\nHe added, however, that \u201cthese are the issues that we need to talk, of course, with our NATO allies as well as these countries.\u201d\n\nKharkiv withdrawal\n\nIn Ukraine, the government and military said Ukrainian forces were holding back a Russian assault in the strategic eastern Donbas region, stifling Moscow\u2019s attempt to annex the south and east.\n\nSince late March, Russia has increasingly turned its attention to eastern Ukraine after failing to take the capital Kyiv.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Lugansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said Ukrainian forces had prevented Russian attempts to cross a river and encircle the city of Severodonetsk.\n\nDefence and military intelligence officials in London and Washington both said Russian forces had sustained heavy losses as they attempted the river crossing and had failed to make significant progress.\n\nThe Ukrainian general staff said troops had managed to push Russian forces out of Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv in the northeast \u2014 a priority target for Moscow.\n\n\u201cThe enemy\u2019s main efforts are focused on ensuring the withdrawal of its units from the city of Kharkiv,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nKharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov meanwhile said in a video on Telegram that Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the direction of the northeastern city of Izyum.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, Major General Kyrylo Budanov, said the months ahead could prove decisive.\n\n\u201cThe breaking point will be in the second part of August,\u201d he told Britain\u2019s Sky News television.\n\n\u201cMost of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year.\u201d\n\nAppeal to China\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday met Mitch McConnell, leader of the Republican minority in the US Senate, and a delegation of US senators in Kyiv.\n\nA Democratic contingent led by House speaker Nancy Pelosi had visited Kyiv earlier.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky said his troops would fight to recapture all occupied territory, and those under siege, including in the devastated southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThere, the last defenders of the city are holed up in a warren of underground tunnels and bunkers at the vast Azovstal steelworks under heavy bombardment.\n\nThe United Nations and Red Cross helped to evacuate women, children and the elderly from the plant whey there were sheltering earlier this month.\n\nBut local officials said around 600 fighters from Ukraine\u2019s Azov regiment were wounded and needed to be brought out for medical treatment.\n\nIn Kyiv, five wives and a father of fighters trapped at the plant appealed directly to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping to step in.\n\n\u201cChina has a big influence on Russia and on Putin personally. We ask for him to intervene,\u201d said one man, Stavr Vychniak.",

          "text": "The 67 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of a Kaduna-bound train habe spent 48 days in the hands of the terrorists, with families and Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, pleading with Nigeria\u2019s federal government to meet the demands of the terrorists so as to secure freedom for their loved ones.\n\nThe terrorists had two week ago freed Sadik, the son of elder statesman and Northern Elders Forum (NEF) convener, Professor Ango Abdullahi, thus reducing the number of captives to 67.\n\nA relative of one of the abductees, who also speaks on behalf of the affected families in Kaduna State, Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, told THISDAY Friday night that their plea remained that the federal government should strike a deal with the terrorists, so that their loved ones can be freed.\n\nPopular Islamic cleric, Gumi, who spoke during a prayer session organised by Jama\u2019iyyar Matan Arewa for the kidnapped passengers on Thursday, also challenged the federal government to meet the demands of the abductors and secure freedom for the abductees.\n\nDr. Jimoh told THISDAY that the traumatised families, for the first time, met with some government officials last week and reiterated that the demands of the captors must be met so that their loved ones can regain freedom.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are sick, tired and frustrated by not having our loved ones for almost 50 days now. There are women, children and the elderly in the forest with these kidnappers. How do you want us to sleep? We can\u2019t sleep. Government has to help us. Government must meet the demands of the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe affected families at a press briefing in Kaduna last Monday asked the terrorists to fear God and release them, lamenting that life had been tough without their breadwinners.\n\nJimoh, who spoke at the press briefing, expressed disappointment with the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, and the management of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), for alleged insensitivity towards the plight of the victims.\n\nThe relations also expressed disappointment that they sought the intervention of the leadership of the National Assembly, \u201cwhich is the people\u2019s Court, but nothing had been forthcoming from them.\u201d\n\nAlso, children of the victims at the press conference by the relations, appealed to the government to do everything possible to ensure the release of their parents.\n\nOne of the children, Ismail Abubakar, 11, said life had been tough without his father, saying, \u201cI am appealing to them to release my father and others safely. They should set them free. Life has been tough without my father since he was kidnapped.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, 18 year old Ruqqayatu Jibril, whose parents are in captivity, pleaded with the terrorists to free their victims.\n\n\u201cI have my parents in captivity. This is their 42nd day in captivity and still counting. We are appealing to the government to bring back our loved ones. We have missed them so much. Some of them are breadwinners of the family. We really need them back. We, the family, are waiting in anguish,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile noting that living without them has been traumatic, she said, \u201cIt is so terrifying. We are appealing to the government to do their best possible to rescue our beloved ones unhurt. We are appealing to the bandits to please free our loved ones. They are also humans. We are humans like you. Even if you don\u2019t share anything in religion, then, you share in humanity.\n\n\u201cWhy should you just capture fellow citizens? You are also citizens of this blessed country. But why should you be capturing people that are your brothers and sisters and keeping them in captivity for almost six weeks. Please and please, fear God and free them.\u201d\n\nGumi at Prayer Session\n\nThe prayer session, which attracted religious leaders from both the Muslim and Christian faiths, was held at the JMA headquarters in Kaduna.\n\nGumi, who led the Muslim prayer, assured the families of the kidnapped passengers that the prayers would make the captives feel divine presence as God would comfort them.\n\nHe urged government to meet the terrorists\u2019 demands so that the victims, who had spent over 40 days in their den, can regain their freedom.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhatever they (the terrorists) want, give it to them so that they can release these people and when they release them then, you are at the liberty, to deal with them the way they deserve because when they have captives, you have to tread with caution so that their captives will not be injured.\u201d\n\nBennett Oghifo",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, by some fanatical students of the same school for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a Whatsapp post.\n\nIn a release issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said the news of the killing of Deborah by fellow students was a matter of concern and demanded an impartial, extensive probe into all that happened before and during the incident.\n\nHe noted that Muslims all over the world demand respect for the Holy Prophets, including Isah (Alaihissalaam, Jesus Christ) and Muhammad (SAW) but where transgressions occur, as alleged to be the case in this instance, the law does not allow anyone to take matters into their hands.\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders preach that it is not for the believer to judge the actions of another person. The constituted authority must be allowed to deal with such matters when they arise.\n\n\u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,\u201d said the President.\n\nPresident Buhari also directed the Ministries of Information and Culture, Police Affairs and that of Communications and Digital Economy to work with GSM providers and Tech companies to help contain the spread of false and inflammatory information through social media.\n\nHe extended the nation\u2019s condolences to the family of the deceased student and called for tampered comments by the media and calm among the general population while investigation is ongoing to find out the remote and immediate causes of the incident.",
