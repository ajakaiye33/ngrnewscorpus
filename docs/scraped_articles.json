          "text": "\u2026Air Peace refused more than one weekly flight to Dubai\n\n\u2026 Emirates initially granted 21 weekly flights to Nigeria\n\nBy Lawani Mikairu\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority ,NCAA, yesterday explained why it withdrew the 21 weekly flights frequency earlier approved for Emirates Airlines by the Ministry of Aviation. Only one weekly flight to Abuja has now be granted to the airline.\n\nThis is just as NCAA revealed that the only Nigerian airline, Air Peace, currently going to Dubai, UAE, was refused multiple flight frequency and given only one weekly flight.\n\nMaking the clarification, the Director General, NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu said with the withdrawal of the 21 flight frequency, which takes effect from December 12, 2021, Emirates Airlines can now fly into Abuja (Nigeria) just once weekly on Thursdays, while its Lagos flight is suspended.\n\nCaptain Nuhu further explained that NCAA withdrew the earlier approval following the refusal of the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of United Arab Emirates, UAE, to grant equal rights to the sole Nigerian carrier, Air Peace flying to Dubai via Sharjah.\n\nHe added that Senator Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Aviation had \u201d graciously granted Emirates Airlines 21 frequencies weekly to two major airports in Nigeria; Lagos, 14 and Abuja, seven.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA DG regretted that despite this approval, the UAE GCAA refused to grant Air Peace three weekly frequencies to Sharjah, which the airline requested for, rather \u201capproved just one frequency weekly\u201d.\n\nAccording to Captain Nuhu, the GCAA had attributed its refusal to grant the three frequencies to the airline to inadequate slots in Sharjah airport, stressing that the government would continue to protect Nigeria\u2019s businesses.\n\nCaptain Musa Nuhu said: \u201cThe Nigerian Government was gracious to grant Emirates Airlines 21 frequencies it requested for. The airline wants to operate 14 weekly flights to Lagos and another seven weekly to Abuja airports.\n\n\u201cHowever, Air Peace only requested for three weekly flights to Sharjah, not even Dubai airport, but the CAA refused the airline. The CAA only approved one weekly frequency to the airline. The only excused they gave was that they don\u2019t have enough slots. Where is the justice in this? That is capital flight out of Nigeria. Nigeria should protect its own.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, NCAA had in a letter with the reference number: NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329, dated December 9, 2021 with the head: \u2018Withdrawal of Ministerial Approval of Emirates Airlines Winter Schedule,\u2019 and signed by Nuhu to the Country Manager, Emirates Airlines withdrew the initial approval granted the airline.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cI write to inform you of the withdrawal of the approval granted to Emirates Airlines winter schedule. This approval was conveyed via a letter with reference number FMA/ATMO/501/C.104/XV/356 dated 1st December 2021. The withdrawal becomes effective on Sunday 12th December 2021 at 23002.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease kindly note, henceforth Emirates Airlines is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Google on Wednesday released the 2021 top trending items on their search engine, showing the most searched terms, topics, personalities, entertainers and many more by Nigerians. The lists, which had different categories with entertainers making up about 5 or 6 of the categories.\n\nFor Nollywood actors, the Top 10 is made up of Destiny Etiko, Zubby Michael, Pere, Tonto Dikeh, Iyabo Ojo, Olu Jacobs, Nafisa Abdullahi, Jim Iyke, Nancy Isime and Alex Ekubo\n\nREAD ALSO:Bbnaija\u2019s Cross releases amapiano banger \u2014 \u2018Feeling Funky\u2019\n\nFor musicians, the Top 10 are Tiwa Savage, Omah Lay, Lil Nas X, Ruger, Ayra Starr, Buju, Bobby Shmurda, Seyi Shay, Chidinma Ekile and Naira Marley.\n\nNollywood: Why they trended\n\nFor Destiny Etiko who has just hit 3.5 million followers on Instagram, her being top searched actress of 2021 may all have been connected to her Instagram page and the reaction it generates, partly on the account of raunchy pictures she posts and of course, some controversies that trailed her this year.\n\nFor Zubby Michael, the declaration that he is the wealthiest actor in Nigeria generated a lot of buzz and consequently, reactions which might have led to searches on Google. Also, he was constantly in the news. His association with Obi Cubana and his ilk may also have played a part,\n\nPere had so many issues during the Big Brother Naija Season 6 that many feared he wouldn\u2019t make it to the final but he did. He actually came third and since he continued his journey in the make-believe world after the reality TV show he had moved from obscurity to prominence.\n\nTonto Dikeh shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise to be on the list. She practically lived the whole of 2021 in the eye of the storm on social media. Her romance with Kpokpogri was a staple on everyone\u2019s table.\n\nIyabo Ojo bulldozed her way into the reckoning during the Baba Ijesha child molestation saga. Iyabo took the case so personally she almost became the case herself. Then, the pretty actress never left social media with all sorts of skits and antics.\n\nThe death rumours that trailed legendary actor, Olu Jacobs were as annoying as they were telling. The rumours broke more than 3 times in a single year.\n\nIt\u2019s quite unusual to have a Kannywood actor making such a buzz. Right? But Nafisa must have got the nod with her fallout with the Arewa Filmmakers Association of Nigeria (AFMAN). The association suspended her for flouting some of their rules.\n\nNancy Isime is a social media person and so is Alex Ekubo. Alex Ekubo has remained one of Nigeria\u2019s eligible bachelors for so long and when he announced his engagement to Fancy Acholonu, the media was awash with feverish buzz but that wasn\u2019t to last. Weeks after, the actor announced breakup with his fiancee, putting paid to the wedding that was being planned.\n\nMusic Industry: Why they trended\n\nIf Tiwa Savage hadn\u2019t made the cut Google would have had some questions to answer. The sex tape saga was the bomb that blew everyone away. First came the rumour and the tape, and everyone, safe for those in the monasteries or convent, saw it \u2013 again and again. But instead of dimming the light of the Somebody\u2019s son crooner, she glowed like the star she is. In fact, Tiwa Savage was the most trending person of 2021 ahead of Obi Cubana and Sunday Igboho.",

Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar held a closed door meeting which lasted for hours at Government house Sokoto.\n\nTambuwal further told the delegation that: \u201cOperation Hadarin Daji,\u201d the precursor of the escalation of tension and crisis in Sokoto state \u201c\u2026was carried out without any blockage around the neighboring states, particularly Sokoto\n\n\u201d The timing of the operation, whereby, unfortunately, our security agents do not have enough equipment to move and contain those that would pander towards Sokoto state didn\u2019t help the timing as well.\n\n\u201cthe timing and way the operation was carried out left Sokoto very vulnerable to attacks and kidnappings.\u201d Says the Governor.\n\n\u201cIt appear those bandits pursued from Zamfara state have relocated to Sokoto state. This is a very serious concern,\u201d he said,\n\n\u201d I am appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto deploy more troops and resources to Sokoto state to fight the criminals.\n\n\u201cThere is need for more boots on the ground. I am familiar with the situation at the center, but I believe that something can be done, and, that should be done urgently and expeditiously because our situation is getting out of hand,\u201d he added.\n\nTambuwal said in his capacity as the Deputy Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), he was fully aware of his counterparts commitment and support to the President in the fight against insecurity and other evils across the country.\n\n\u201cHere in Sokoto state, you can verify this from the heads of security agencies, there is nothing they have asked of us that we have not done. Since the commencement of this administration, we have given security personnel in Sokoto state not less than 500 vehicles. We are also doing whatever it takes in terms of funding from our own end despite the lean resources that we have as a state,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gen. Monguno, who thanked Governor Tambuwal for cutting short an official trip to receive the Federal Government delegation at a very short notice, said they were in Sokoto \u201con a specific mission on the instruction of President Buhari, \u201cto condole you and the very good people of Sokoto state as well as His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, who apparently is in Abuja, over the unfortunate incidents that have been occurring over the last couple of weeks.\n\nHe explained that their visit \u201caffirms the seriousness with which Mr President views the occurrence of the last couple of weeks, stressing that: \u201cIt has been unfortunate series of developments in which very innocent lives have been lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo life lost is one that is less important. Every life of every citizen is important; and, it gives great concern to Mr President that needless loses of lives are occurring.\n\n\u201cMr President wants me to convey his profound condolence over the loss of all the citizens who have departed. He wants us to also express his deep sympathy as well as his determination that the perpetrators of this very gruesome, wicked activities are apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that the very top security echelon in the country is here is an indication that Mr President wants us to address this issue so that some form of comfort is given to the people of Sokoto state by a definite closure through a definite process in concluding what has happened to these unfortunate and innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cMr President is deeply troubled that fellow citizens had to go through this trauma. He has charged to make sure that all the relevant agencies do not rest until we are able to flush out the perpetrators of not just these last two incidents that occurred, but also previous incidents,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State, Comrade Zailani Bappa, has lamented that armed struggle as a phenomenon in Nigeria has assumed a new dimension in the wake of the turn of democratic rule in the last lap of the 20th Century.\n\nAccording to him, the new wave of freedom from military rule in 1999 seemed to come with a snag; the emergence of a new rise to new wave of social agitations and its consequent abuse of human rights and laws of the land.\n\n\u201cJust like in the wake of the democratic rule in 1979, which birthed the rise of the Maitatsine uprising, the 1999 democratic turn birthed the rise of Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria. These are uprisings that have a theological root attached to their philosophy, albeit a queer interpretation of the Islamic by the two separate insurgents.\n\n\u201cThere are other agitations today though, which included the separatists\u2019 uprisings in the name of The IPOB and the Odua Nation led by Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho, which lately assumed arms struggle and grew up to the breach of the Supremacy of the constitution and the Sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Shia group who are equally agitating for an Islamic State steered by the Shia Philosophy has not openly employed arms either against the State or the people but equally a brand of dissidence\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the most worrisome of the claimed struggles is the latest wave of criminality, a form of banditry that spread across the North-Western states of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt started as a form of cattle rustling among the Fulani ethnic group scattered across the land which metamorphosed into kidnappings for ransom, killings and arson. It has now matured into crass satanism by burning humans alive without purpose at all\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard a lot of apologists for these bandits. They try at all times to justify the drift by the Fulani, known for their \u201cPulako\u201d into outright criminality which they are trying hard to justify as a certain struggle for justice\u201d\n\n\u201cA new wave of campaigns subtly being advanced is that the bandits in the North-West took up arms to defend the honour and integrity of the Fulani tribe because they have been neglected by the authorities where they lived. They are not being provided with education, health services etc, they said.\n\n\u201cI am not going to delve into this vast area of controversy because the proponents of this argument are a highly influential class in the society. The Forum of Governors of Northern Nigeria have the task of taking this argument to the cleaners with facts and figures of their previous budgets and programs for communities in their respective states.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government also has the onerous duty to discredit this dangerous argument because it has the potential of setting a precedence for more ethnic upheavals across the country.\n\n\u201cWhat I do know is what happened in Zamfara State; that at the wake of his administration in 2019, Governor Bello Mohammed did invite all the stakeholders of the Fulani in Zamfara state and offered them a peace process where all their grievances were tabled.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the entire grievances of the Fulani were not peculiar to them, but shared with every other community, some of which have dire needs than the Fulani. All these are tied to scarce resources vis-a-vis the progressing population explosion we are experiencing today\n\n\u201cNonetheless, the Governor went ahead to specially address these grievances including, but not limited to the construction of multi-billion naira RUGA for them in each of the three Senatorial zones of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Governor has also constructed 147 Primary Health Centers across the rural areas of the state as well as constructed more than 1000 classroom blocks in the rural areas. He also banned the \u2018Yan-Sa-Kai Vigilantes which they alleged were killing their brethren in the rural areas. However, the banditry phenomenon in the state did not stop.\n\n\u201cWhatever the case may be, the bandits we have in the North-Western States of Kaduna, Katsina, Niger, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara are purely criminals by intent, purpose and action. They are not representing the Fulani, nor any logical cause at all.\n\n\u201cIf indeed, they are fighting for their ethnic clans, we would have seen them channeling their proceeds to the development of those clans. If they are indeed, fighting for justice, one will wonder what offense ordinary peasants have committed in this saga that the bandits will intercept their vehicle and set them ablaze!\n\n\u201cHistory has shown that banditry anywhere in the World thrives only when the bandits have support of invisible hands and the tacit support of trusted influential persons in the society. Our people should be rest assured that the Government is poised to fish out sponsors of these criminals just as the security operatives are doing their best to bring their criminality to a standstill.\n\n\u201cSuffice also to say that the bandits we have today cannot claim any moral cause to take up arms against innocent citizens in the name of struggle for justice. That is why a Nigerian Court recently declared them as terrorists. They shall continue to be treated as such until the desired end to their undesirable menace is brought to a glorious end.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nPan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation, Afenifere, has said it was not desperate to have a Yoruba man as Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nThe group said it would rather favour a president that emerges from any part of the South.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe group\u2019s position was in contrast with that of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), which said it supported a president of Yoruba extraction.\n\nThe two leading Yoruba groups made their positions known during separate interviews on Friday with Saturday Sun, following consultations being made by some APC governors, which was exclusively reported by this newspaper last Saturday.\n\nSpecial Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN), which is South West Affairs; Mr. Adekunle Olayinka; Special Adviser to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on Social Investment Programmes (SIP); Victor Kolade; and Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Adesina Popoola, and Chief Oladipo Oladosu, a frontline politician in Osun State, among others, had met in Ibadan recently under the aegis of Next Level Consolidation Forum, to ensure that South West is rock solid to produce the president for Nigeria in 2023.\n\nThey insisted that presidential power must come to the South West in 2023, and the acceptable person that the Yoruba would present for the office would be decided as time progresses.\n\nBut in an interview with Saturday Sun, National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cFirst of all, the presidency in 2023 must shift to the Southern part of the country. We insist on that. For whether it should be South East, South South or South West, we want the best person, who will do the job, correct all the anomalies that the country is going through, and ensure that Nigeria move forward to where other countries are in the 21st Century and beyond.\n\n\u201cThat is the kind of candidate that we are looking forward to. To be specific, when we get close to that time, we will decide. As far as we are concerned in Afenifere, whoever that emerges as president in 2023, will have problem in running the country if Nigeria is not restructured. There must be serious tinkering with the present structure in such a way that it will be pro-people, rather than how it is now.\n\n\u201cThere must be restructuring before 2023. The question of where the president will come from is secondary. But the president must come from the Southern part of this country. What we are running on the country today is more or less a unitary government, which concentrates too much power at the centre. So, we are calling for decentralization and genuine commitment to the rule of law and federalism. We are insisting that these must take place before the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General, YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, told Saturday Sun that he would be \u201cvery delighted if Nigerians decide to elect our kinsman as president in 2023 for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the landscape of Nigeria, without being immodest, Yoruba people appear to be the most liberal and most accommodating in Nigeria. Traditionally, Yoruba culture is that at all times, we must do what is right and you must insist on fairness and equity for all.\u201d\n\nOlajide stated further that the APC governors that have been making consultations should let the council know what they are doing. He added that the Yoruba that are interested in contesting for president in 2023 should come out clearly and declare their intention. This, he said, would allow the council to lend its weight to it.\n\n\u201cOf course, we will support it if we are all of the opinion and believe that the person has a national clout to emerge as president and to be embraced by all parts of this country. But we want to know who are the Yoruba people that are showing interests.\n\nOlajide also commented on the preference of the council between restructuring and the election. \u201cPersonally, and I know that is going to be the opinion of the council. We prefer restructuring or having a brand new constitution, because whoever emerges as president will have idiosyncrasies. But the constitution is the grundnorm on which he has to work.\n\n\u201cThe preference of every Nigerian, in my humble opinion, should now be true federalism, at least limit human frailties of whoever emerges as president. But election is a matter of the constitution. We will have the election in 2023 by God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Vincent Kalu, Lagos\n\nThe recent call by two prominent Igbo leaders \u2013 Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, former Secretary of the Government of the Federation, and Chukwuemeka Ezeife, elder statesman, and former governor of Anambra State on the North to cede the post of the President to a Nigerian of Igbo extraction, has divided some Igbo socio-political groups. While some of them are irked by what they see as the subservient nature of the appeal, others think that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, as far as politics is concerned.\n\nMovement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), yesterday, said it was abominable for the Igbo to kneel to people in order to mount the saddle of power.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nLeader of MASSOB, Comrade Uchenna Madu stated this while reacting to what he considers as the \u201cinsensitive and insulting remarks\u201d allegedly made by Senator Anyim and Chief Ezeife, on the quest for an Igbo man to become the next President of Nigeria. He noted that the Igbo are not slaves to power.\n\nMadu decried what he sees as the appealing or kowtowing tendencies of the two Igbo statesmen that portray Ndigbo as being ready to kneel down in begging for the position of Nigerian president. According to the MASSOB leader, a beggar only begs for something that does not belong to him, stressing that a beggar is always inferior to the giver.\n\nHe insisted: \u201cNdigbo are not beggars. It is an abomination that Igbo elders will kneel down for another. Even though the lives of Ndigbo are at risk, we can never beg; rather, we devise our own means of fighting back because Igbos must survive. Ndigbo are not cowards or weaklings.\u201d\n\nHe advised Igbo elders to stop making disgraceful and disrespectful utterances in their quest for the President of Nigeria. \u201cOccupying the seat of the President of Nigeria is not the greatest need of Ndigbo now,\u201d he said. \u201cNdigbo want Biafra, not Igbo presidency.\u201d\n\nHe urged Igbo elders and leaders to seriously embark on convincing thousands of Igbo entrepreneurs, estate developers, international businessmen, captains of industry, great researchers, world-class engineers, religious leaders to start rapid development and investment in Igbo land. He added that being a president of Nigeria for four or eight years is not the ultimate desire of Ndigbo.\n\nSupporting the MASSOB leader\u2019s stance, the National President of Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), Chief Mayor Echefu, said that Igbo do not kneel for anybody or group, but only to Almighty God.\n\nSaid he: \u201cDr. Ezeife is a respected Igbo leader; we hold him in high esteem. We have always followed and agreed with him in the pursuit of Igbo cause and agenda, but on this issue of kneeling to beg for presidency, we are not with him. It is not our culture to kneel for any mortal; when others were bowing and kneeling for the Whiteman, we didn\u2019t do that, so why should we do that today?\u201d\n\n\n\nLike Madu, he insisted that \u201cwe are not asking for the presidency; all we are asking and clamouring for is our freedom for us to go and develop at our own pace.\n\n\u201cThe North that has produced the president for 41 out of 60 years since independence, where are they? All the negative indices of underdevelopment are prevalent in that region. What have they done with their long-hold on power? Can their leaders visit their villages? That is hypocritical on their own part.\u201d\n\nHe also took a swipe at the President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, who in his reply to Ezeife noted that it was already too late for the Igbo to beg for presidency. He accused Shettima of seeking relevance and added that he should be ashamed of his region.\n\nBut the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) disagreed with MASSOB and IIYC on the issue. Chairman of ADF Media and Publicity Bureau, Abia Onyike noted that it was left for each Igbo presidential aspirant to decide which approach to adopt in pursuing his aspiration. Onyike argued that there is nothing wrong with begging in power negotiation.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the presidential aspirant as an individual. It is up to such a fellow to play the political game in such a way as to obtain victory. Whether you call it lobbying or prostrating or genuflecting or consultations, it is all politics. It is bad politics to claim that the presidential seat is your right when you know that it is the kingmakers who will decide it. In politics, little things matter. Let those who can do it carry on. What we need are results.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .",

          "text": "Says eastern axis of state in the grip of fleeing bandits\n\nCalls for deployment of forces along borders with Zamfara\n\nPresident vows to flush out perpetrators\n\nBy Onuminya Innocent In Sokoto\n\nSokoto state Governor\u2019 Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has said parts of the state are in appalling grip of bandits and kidnappers marauding and scaring the populace in recent times. He blamed\n\nthe situation on the influx of bandits and criminals displaced by the defective maneuvers of security personnel deployed, under Operation Hadarin Daji, to end their nefarious activities in neighboring Zamfara state.\n\nThese, according to Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto state, has left the state \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d to the deadly and inhuman activities of these criminal elements.\n\nTambuwal stated these on Friday when he received a high powered Federal Government delegation led by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Muhammad Babagana Munguno (rtd), pointing out that the consequences of Operation Hadarin Daji has resulted, before now and in the last four days, \u201cin broad daylight\u201d attacks and kidnappings \u201cin some parts of Isa , Sabon Birni, Tangaza, Illela \u201cand several other local government areas of the state.\u201d\n\nMonguno\u2019s team include: the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), Maj. Gen. Samuel Adebayo, the Directors-General of the Department of State Services and the National Intelligence Agency, Yusuf Maitama Bichi and Amb. Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar respectively.\n\nGov. Tambuwal told the security and intelligence chiefs that: \u201cOperation Hadarin Daji,\u201d the precursor of the escalation of tension and crisis in Sokoto state\u201d was carried out without any blocking force around the neighboring states, particularly Sokoto state.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, the timing of the operation, whereby, unfortunately, our security agents do not have enough equipment to move and curtail and contain those that would pander towards Sokoto state didn\u2019t help the timing as well. So, the timing and the way the operation was carried out left Sokoto very vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt does appear as if those bandits pursued from Zamfara state have relocated to Sokoto state. This is a very serious call for concern,\u201d he said, appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto deploy more resources to Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cThere is need for more boots on the ground. I am familiar with the situation at the center, but I believe that something can be done, and, that should be done urgently and expeditiously because our situation is getting out of hand,\u201d he added.\n\nPerhaps also in his capacity as the Deputy Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Tambuwal reiterated his counterparts\u2019 commitment and support to the President in the fight against insecurity and other evils and made a specific mention of the support his administration had been giving to the apex government in his state.\n\n\u201cHere in Sokoto state, you can verify this from the heads of security agencies, there is nothing they have asked of us that we have not done. Absolutely nothing. Since the commencement of this administration, we have given security personnel in Sokoto state not less than 500 vehicles. We are also doing whatever it takes in terms of funding from our own end despite the lean resources that we have as a state,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gen. Monguno, who thanked Gov. Tambuwal for cutting short an official trip to receive the Federal Government delegation at a very short notice, said they were in Sokoto \u201con a specific mission and instruction of President Buhari, \u201cto condole with you and the very good people of Sokoto state as well as His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, who apparently is in Abuja, over the unfortunate incidents that have been occurring over the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nHe explained that their visit \u201caffirms the seriousness with which Mr President views the occurrence of the last couple of weeks, stressing that: \u201cIt has been unfortunate series of developments in which very innocent lives have been lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo life lost \u2026 is less important. Every life of every citizen is important; and, it gives great concern to Mr President that needless losses of lives are occurring.\n\n\u201cMr President wants me to convey his profound condolence over the loss of all the citizens who have departed. He wants us to also express his deep sympathy as well as his determination that the perpetrators of this very gruesome, wicked activities are apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that the very top security echelon in the country is here is an indication that Mr President wants us to address this issue so that some form of comfort is given to the people of Sokoto state by a definite closure through a definite process in concluding what has happened to these unfortunate and innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cMr President is deeply troubled that fellow citizens had to go through this trauma. He has charged to make sure that all the relevant agencies do not rest until we are able to flush out the perpetrators of not just these last two incidents that occurred, but also previous incidents,\u201d he said.\n\nMonguno\u2019s delegation afterwards had about an hour closed door session with their host, his Deputy, Hon. Manir Muhammad Dan\u2019Iya, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Aminu Muhammad Achida, Chairmen of Isa and Sabon Birni local government area, heads of security agencies in the state, some traditional rulers and other top government officials of the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria continues to face security challenges which pose a threat to democracy, and therefore called on global partners to support Nigeria\u2019s efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Biden, government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far. It is one governance system that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusiveness in governance. It also promotes social justice, economic and social development and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u201d the President said.\n\nHe also noted that the summit was taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\n\u201cThis event will help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies today. It is hoped that through our collective action, we can safeguard democratic values and principles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made it impossible to convene the meeting face to face, had taken a heavy toll on economies, health and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions.\u201d\n\nWhile pledging Nigeria\u2019s support for democratic governance in West Africa, Buhari, however, expressed concern about the threat of undemocratic take-over of government in the sub region.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region West Africa and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Wale Igbintade\n\nThe Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, yesterday dismissed two appeals filed by the Chairman of Global Fleet Group, Jimoh Ibrahim, challenging the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria\u2019s seizure of his assets and freezing of his bank accounts over his alleged N69.4 billion debt.\n\nThe appellate court upheld the November 4, 2020 order of Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court, Lagos which authorised AMCON to take over Ibrahim\u2019s assets.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the panel of justices upheld the arguments of AMCON\u2019s lead counsel, Dr. Kemi Pinheiro SAN, who prayed the court to dismiss Ibrahim\u2019s application because it was incompetent.\n\nChief Niyi Akintola, SAN, is the counsel to the 1st defendant Jimoh Ibrahim, while Chief Bolaji Ayorinde, SAN, is for 2nd Defendant, Global Fleet Group.\n\nAMCON had on November 4, 2020 through Pinheiro obtained an ex-parte order against NICON Investment Limited, Global Fleet Oil and Gas Limited and Jimoh Ibrahim, freezing their accounts in various banks, as well as attaching various properties of the companies.\n\nThe Properties include the building of NICON Investment Limited at Plot 242, Muhammadu Buhari Way, Central Business District, Abuja; NICON Hotels Limited building at Plot 557, Port Harcourt Crescent, off Gimbiya Street, Abuja and the building of NICON Lekki Limited at No. 5, Customs Street, Lagos.\n\nOther properties are the building of Abuja International Hotels Limited located at No. 3, Hospital Road, Lagos; another property at Plot 242, Muhammadu Buhari Way, Abuja; the former Allied Bank Building on Mile 2, Oshodi Expressway, Apapa Road, Lagos; Energy House located on No. 94, Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos; NICON Building at No. 40, Madeira Street, Maitama, Abuja; a Residential Apartment at Road 2, House A14, Victoria Garden City, Lagos; NICON Hotels Building at Plot 3, Road 3, Victoria Garden City, Lagos, as well as the NICON Luxury Hotel\u2019s Building, Garki I, FCT, Abuja.\n\nFollowing the execution of the order, Nicon Investment Limited, Global Fleet Oil and Gas Limited and Jimoh Ibrahim, through Akintola, filed a motion at the Federal High Court dated November 19, 2020, seeking to discharge/set aside Justice Aikawa\u2019s order.\n\nSome other entities which AMCON alleged were linked to Ibrahim, including Nicon Insurance Limited, Nigerian-Re-Insurance Limited, Abuja Hotel Limited and Nicon Hotels Limited also filed an application asking the judge to discharge the said order.\n\nAfter hearing the two applications and the arguments canvassed by parties through their respective counsel, Justice Aikawa dismissed both applications by his ruling of February 16, 2021.\n\nIn addition to the takeover of the properties, the court also ordered the freezing of all accounts belonging to Ibrahim and his companies, including Global Fleet Oil & Gas Limited and NICON Investment Limited all of whom are defendants in the Suit.\n\nDissatisfied, both applicants filed separate appeals, which were all thrown out yesterday.\n\nAMCON was represented in the appeals by Pinheiro, while the first set of Appellants was represented by Akintola and the second set by Ayorinde.\n\nAt the hearing of the appeals on September 30, 2021, Pinheiro raised a preliminary objection to the appeal, contending that the appeal was incompetent because the Appellants failed to seek leave prior to the filing of the appeal.\n\nIn a unanimous decision yesterday, the Court of Appeal upheld the preliminary objection of AMCON and accordingly dismissed both appeals.\n\nThe implication of this is that AMCON remains in possession of the properties attached by the order of Justice Aikawa on November 4, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nFormer president Olusegun Obasanjo and the former vice-president of Uganda, Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, have condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nA number of countries in Europe banned travel from countries in Africa following the discovery of the variant by South African scientists.\n\nObasanjo is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, while Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise, was the first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation.\n\nSpeaking on the development regarding Omicron, the duo, in a joint article published yesterday in The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\n\u201cWhat message was being sent? That each country by unilaterally bolting its gates will be able to hold back the tide of a pandemic, alone? That contributing to our global understanding of the evolution of a world plague, by sharing the fruits of years of genomic capabilities development, should lead to a country being ostracised?\u201d they asked.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, rather than issue travel bans, what the world needs \u201cin these Omicron times is smart multilateralism.\n\n\u201cEven after we had learnt that shutting the doors made no sense at this point, the emotive comfort of locking out the other proved too tempting to resist,\u201d they said.\n\nThe two leaders continued: \u201cYet, to run effective contact tracing in a time of rapid global physical connectivity, information and goodwill is required from countries far and near to plot the trajectory of a virus moving at the speed of flight. Detecting a variant in a person who happens to be from or at point A on the globe says nothing about all the other places the variant may have touched before eventually slipping into the cells of the unfortunate carrier.\n\n\u201cA very different form of global hyper-cooperation is required to match the pace of such a fast spreading virus. We in Africa have learnt the hard way that we are in an age where the old models of multilateralism have run their full course.\n\n\u201cMarked by slow bureaucracy and symbolisms of comity rather than pragmatic trust and modern instruments, this old multilateralism has frozen attempts to reform global trade to serve the people rather than corporations.\n\n\u201cIt has hobbled efforts to turn the energy transition into a moment to balance the obscene imbalances in population and consumption. And it has led to a world where annually we assemble in New York to address injustice and yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 threatened to disrupt Africa\u2019s biggest multilateral endeavour in half a century \u2013 the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) \u2013 \u2018radical agility\u2019 became our only path forward.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s embrace of smart multilateralism is manifest in being the first continent to agree on a common digital platform for bio-surveillance and biosecurity. Absolutely convinced that the each-for-herself idea embodied in border closures has serious limits, we set out to work with the private and civil society sectors to create both institutional and technological innovations to keep the borders open but the virus out.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of skillful compromises and modern technologies, we pressed on and ensured that the timeline for start of trading would be maintained. It was as clear as noonday to those of us championing African multilateralism that retreating behind the walls of nationalist survival would be continental suicide. It would also be generational suicide because COVID and AfCFTA are both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is smart multilateralism at work. It is the only way forward for a continent like ours that has long been marginalised in the global scheme of things. But the more we look at the state of globalisation in the world today, the more convinced we are that it is the whole world that needs smart multilateralism and not just Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Demands immediate situation report\n\n*Hundreds protest in Kano over massacres in the North\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nApparently jolted by recent killings in Sokoto and Katsina states by terrorists, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday dispatched a high-level five-man security delegation, made up of the heads of the nation\u2019s intelligence and security services, to the two states, with a mandate for quick recommendations on how to end the carnage.\n\nOn the same day, hundreds of youths stormed the streets of Kano State, with banners and placards, protesting mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, the Buhari delegation, led by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Munguno (rtd) was sent to Sokoto and Katsina states in response to the spike in activities of terrorists.\n\nOther members of the delegation are the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba; the Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi; the Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar and the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo.\n\nThe President is expecting an immediate situation report and recommendations on actions to follow to effectively deal with the worrisome situation.\n\nSokoto Killings\n\nTerrorists have been ravaging Sokoto State for almost three years, with several local government areas under the control of the outlaws. Daily, scores are killed, many abducted and houses burnt in these places.\n\nLast Thursday, three people were killed by extremists who invaded Kurawa village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe attack occurred hours after Governor Aminu Tambuwal visited the area on a condolence visit to the families of travellers burnt to death by terrorists last Sunday.\n\nJust last Monday, scores were killed when the terrorists struck in Gidan Bawa village, Isa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nDuring the attack, the terrorists burnt 23 travellers in a bus heading to Kaduna.\n\nKatsina Killings\n\nIn Katsina State, the terrorists are active in virtually all the local government areas. Worst hit are Kurfi, Dutsinma, Matazu, Musawa, Malumfashi, Dandume, Bakori, Funtua, Kafur and Danja.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Katsina State Commissioner of Science and Technology, Dr. Rabe Nasir, was killed in his House located at Fatima Shema Quarters, Katsina.\n\nOne of the residents, who does not want his name in print, said: \u201cThe gunmen stormed the house at night and attacked him. They killed him and locked his corpse up in one of the rooms where we discovered it today (Thursday).\u201d\n\nNasir, 61, a former member of the House of Representatives, was also a former official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nThe Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has persistently expressed worries about the security challenges bedeviling the state, noting that 10 out of 34 local government areas of the state are under persistent attacks by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nHe affirmed that the deteriorating spate of banditry, kidnapping, rape and armed robbery were clogs in his government\u2019s effort at restoring peace and normalcy in the state.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the state by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, he said: \u201cWe here in Katsina, if we say we are very happy, we are not being honest. We are disturbed with this issue of banditry accompanied with kidnapping, raping of innocent women, armed robbery on our highways. I want technology to be properly deployed to bring these activities under control.\n\n\u201cTen out of 34 local governments in Katsina State are under severe bandits\u2019 attacks daily. So, with that in mind, there is no way we can sleep. Our phones are permanently on to hear what is happening in local governments. Before breakfast, I am briefed about what happened last night. So, General, we are not in a very comfortable situation but we thank God.\u201d\n\nBuhari Vows to Bring Killers of Katsina Commissioner to Justice\n\nPresident Buhari yesterday expressed sadness over the gruesome killing of Nasir, vowing to bring the culprits to justice. He has ordered a manhunt for those behind the murder.\n\nHe said death of the commissioner had illuminated the need for all and sundry, agencies, organisations and institutions to understand the gravity of the security challenges and the need to forestall future occurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe president\u2019s security delegation, led by Monguno, condoled with the government and people of the state over the incident.\n\nMonguno noted that the nation had been gripped by the news of the tragic incident and that efforts were on to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gruesome murder of Dr. Rabe Nasir, a serving commissioner in Katsina State, is a great loss, not only to Katsina State, but also to the entire nation.\n\n\u201cMr. President has the confidence that the Nigeria Police Force will uncover those who perpetrated the crime and the proper criminal justice and the process of the law will take place and these people will be brought to book.\n\n\u201cThis has illuminated the need for all of us in this country, whatever agency, organisation or institution to understand the gravity of this sought of incident and to ensure not only to forestall such incidents in the future but to actually reach an end stage.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMr. President wants me and the members of our delegation to reassure you of his commitment to ensure safety and security of individuals and institutions. Mr. President is deeply touched and shocked over this sort of assassination.\u201d\n\nResponding, Masari, challenged security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of the act in order to face the wrath of the law.\n\nKano Youths Protest over Killings in the North\n\nHundreds of youths yesterday in Kano besieged the government house roundabout with banners and placards in peaceful protest over mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe protesters carried placards with different inscriptions, asking President Buhari to act immediately.\n\nThey marched from Audu Bako secretariat to Kano Government House, where security operatives received the group of protesters, listened to them and promised to take the matter further to the appropriate quarters.\n\nThe Convener of the protest, Zainab Naseer Ahmad, lamented how insecurity was threatening the lives and livelihood of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe come to share our concern and send a message to our leaders; we are tired of the worsening state of insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nThe protesters, chanting songs of peace, called on President Buhari and the governors to show more interest in tackling insecurity.\n\nThere has been outrage in the North since terrorists burnt alive some travellers in Sokoto State early in the week.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "summary": "Buhari, it was gathered, would also be embarking on local trips to Ebonyi, Kano as well as to his hometown of Daura in Katsina State where he is likely to spend the New Year break.\nLocal trips in December include Ebonyi, Kano and Daura where he will likely spend the New Year break,\u201d a source within the President's circle told SaharaReporters on Saturday.\nShortly after hosting and meeting South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, Buhari left the nation's capital, Abuja, for the UAE.\nSee Also Politics Junketing Nigerian President, Buhari Jets Out To UAE For ExhibitionThe Nigerian President has been junketing across the world in the last three months.\nIn September 2021, Buhari travelled to New York, United States, to participate in the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.",

          "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) says the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (NCAA) action to limit Emirates\u2019 flights to once weekly is unjustifiable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter dated December 10 was addressed to the Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, and signed by Abdulla Bin Touq Al Mari, minister of economy and chairman of the UAE\u2019s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).\n\nAccording to the letter, GCAA said the action taken by the NCAA regarding the Air Peace\u2019s approval at Sharjah is \u201cnot in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Emirates announced the suspension of operations between Nigeria and Dubai until both countries resolved the fresh diplomatic row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a travel notice on its website on Friday evening, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) flag carrier said the suspension will start on Monday until when Nigeria and the Arab nation \u201csolve the ongoing issue\u201d.\n\nAl Mari said Air Peace, which initially operated at Sharjah Airport, had shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah Airport, saying the airport authority cannot keep their slots after the airline left.\n\n\u201cIt would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport,\u201d the GCAA chairman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation of Nigeria and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December of 20921, whereby Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the country manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria, regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their Winter Schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NCAA further advised EK that his withdrawal become effective on Sunday 12, 2021, and hence EK is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, at it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire.\n\n\u201cAir Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport, and then returned to Sharjah Airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UAE aviation authority further said Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140 percent slot capacity \u2014 and that the country had made goodwill by accommodating Air Peace with one slot of the three requested.\n\nIt, however, urged NCAA to review the decision and restore the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Scheule, as filed.\n\n\u201cWe wish to kindly advise you that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous efforts on their side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested,\u201d the letter adds.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of the positive relations.\n\n\u201cFinally, we suggest that Air Peace should consider flying their two flights to any UAE airport at which there are available slots. As expected, the GCAA will support Air Peace in this activity, where required.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your kind support is anticipated so that the NCAA reviews their decision and restores the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Scheule, as filed. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that this is purely an operational matter between Air Peace and Sharjah Airport, and in any case, it should have absolutely no implication for Emirates Airline.\u201d",

It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UAE aviation authority further said Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140 percent slot capacity \u2014 and that the country had made goodwill by accommodating Air Peace with one slot of the three requested.\n\nIt, however, urged NCAA to review the decision and restore the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Scheule, as filed.\n\n\u201cWe wish to kindly advise you that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous efforts on their side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested,\u201d the letter adds.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of the positive relations.\n\n\u201cFinally, we suggest that Air Peace should consider flying their two flights to any UAE airport at which there are available slots. As expected, the GCAA will support Air Peace in this activity, where required.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your kind support is anticipated so that the NCAA reviews their decision and restores the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Scheule, as filed. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that this is purely an operational matter between Air Peace and Sharjah Airport, and in any case, it should have absolutely no implication for Emirates Airline.\u201d",

Here are five updates about the pandemic this Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudy: Boosters give more than 70% protection from mild Omicron\n\nA UK study says booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine give an estimated 70 to 75 percent protection against mild disease from the new Omicron variant.\n\nAccording to the UK Health Security Agency, citing initial findings from a real-world study, Omicron could greatly reduce the protection against mild disease from an initial two-dose vaccination, but boosters restored the protection to an extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese early estimates should be treated with caution, but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain,\u201d Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland approves vaccination of children with Pfizer COVID vaccine\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s medicine regulator, Swissmedic, has approved the vaccination of children between the age of five and 11 with the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine.\n\nThe government also asked regional authorities to consider expanding the requirement for proof of vaccination or recovery from the COVID-19 infection for access to many indoor venues.\n\nHealth group warns of global shortage of nurses as pandemic enters the third year\n\nHoward Catton, CEO of the International Council of Nurses, says that the numbers of nurses around the world are falling as the COVID pandemic enters its third year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatton also warned that there is an imbalance as western countries step up recruitment of healthcare workers from African and other poorer countries.\n\n\u201cI think that we are at a tipping point \u2026 if those numbers continue the trend that we are seeing, it could be an exodus of people,\u201d Catton said.\n\n\u201cI almost think that governments need to be thinking about the life support package of measures they need to be putting together to invest in their nurses and their health care workers next year.\n\n\u201cWe have absolutely seen increased recruitment activity by the UK and Germany as examples in Europe, the US and Canada in North America as well,\u201d he said, adding that African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria were seeing their nurses recruited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had said 115,000 nurses died from COVID at 115,000, but Catton said the figure is probably double.\n\nNigeria records 533 COVID infection\n\nNigeria has seen a surge in the daily number of COVID cases amid the spread of the Omicron variant.\n\nOn Friday, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recorded 533 cases across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency said the reported cases were from 10 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).\n\nLagos recorded 428 infections, followed by FCT (45) and Rivers (33).\n\nOther states that logged new cases were Edo (9), Ogun (8), Oyo (3), Delta (2), Kaduna (2), Gombe (1), Jigawa (1), and Kano (1).\n\nThe agency data showed that 42 people were discharged from the infection \u2014 and no death.\n\nThe NCDC also said the recoveries include 20 community discharges reported on the 8th in FCT.\n\nSo far, Nigeria has confirmed 216,451 cases and 207,661 recoveries. The country\u2019s death toll now stands at 2,981.\n\nOmicron: Obasanjo, Wandira-Kazibwe advocate \u2018global hyper-cooperation\u2019 amid travel ban\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo and Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, former vice-president of Uganda, have condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron COVID variant.\n\nSeveral western nations banned travel from Africa following the discovery of the Omicron COVID variant by South Africa.\n\nObasanjo, a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, and Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise and first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation, in a joint article published on Friday on The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents\u201d.",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "CinetPay, an Ivory Coast-based startup that enables merchants in francophone Africa to accept and make electronic payments online or via mobile Point of Sale (PoS) devices, on Wednesday said it has raised $2.4 million seed funding.\n\n4DX Ventures, a pan-African venture capital fund and Nigeria-based unicorn startup, Flutterwave are co-investors in the round.\n\nOn CinetPay\u2019s mobile and web-based platform, businesses can sign up to process payments from over 130 different payment operators\u2014including MTN mobile money, M-Pesa, Orange Money, Visa, Mastercard, etc\u2014via a single interface.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments, eliminating the need for merchants to integrate with different systems for managing sales and revenues. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region. According to Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave\u2019s founder and CEO, both startups have a \u201cshared vision to simplify payments on the continent.\u201d\n\nAll over Africa, the mobile money market is booming with West Africa being one of the fastest-growing regions in the continent. In Ivory Coast, CinetPay\u2019s first market, up to 75% of the population owns a mobile money account whereas less than 25% have a bank account.\n\nSimilarly, up to 80% of the population in the French-speaking African region have a mobile money account and less than 20% bank accounts.\n\nCinetPay\u2019s gateway aggregates all payment options available in the region, enabling merchants, through digital accounts, to accept online payments and reduce the reliance on cash.\n\nWalter Baddoo, co-founder and General Partner at 4DX Ventures reveals that the VC firm has been \u201ctracking the francophone Africa market\u201d for some time now and is impressed by CinetPay\u2019s ambitious goal to digitise payments across the region. The company is an investor in Flutterwave as well.\n\n\u201cFor a first institutional investment, we couldn\u2019t have asked for two better partners in 4DX Ventures and Flutterwave,\u201d Monthe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve selected highly strategic partners as investors and are excited about the immediate next steps we take together in terms of simplifying and improving digital payments in francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Enterprise Hotel is democratising real estate investments for regular Africans",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before tech startups democratised investing in the stock market, anyone looking to invest in the stock market needed a significant amount of money. But that changed with the entrance of startups like Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka.\n\nFor the first time, Nigerians could buy stocks with as little as $10 (\u20a65,000). Although most stocks available are of foreign companies, that innovation provided Nigerians with a way to invest small sums of money.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb upended the hospitality industry when it made it possible for individuals to rent out their homes. In the process, it allowed people to get a slice of the pie that is the hospitality industry.\n\nHelping Africans to own commercial real estate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, owning a property is the Nigerian dream. However, the absence of suitable mortgage or financing options means one would require a considerable upfront investment to live their dream. With only 2% of Nigerians reportedly having up to \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits, owning a property is out of reach for most people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFractional investment startup, Enterprise Hotel, hopes to change this by offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nLike the model used by investment tech startups, individuals can now own properties with minimal investments. The startup offers three product classes, the first being the room sale. Under this arrangement, individuals can outrightly purchase a room.\n\nThe block sale is the second level, and for this, Enterprise Hotel divides a room into ten blocks, allowing people to purchase each block. So, if the price for a room has been set at \u20a630 million, for instance, a block would cost \u20a63 million.\n\nThe unit sale is the last unit, and with this, Enterprise Hotel divides the room into a thousand parts. Consequently, it becomes easy for more people to purchase real estate regardless of their income levels.\n\nHow Enterprise Hotel makes money\n\nEnterprise Hotel makes money in two ways. The first is via the sale of the rooms and the second is through a management fee paid by the investors. With the management fee, Enterprise Hotel covers management costs, including recruitment on behalf of the investors.\n\nSo why real estate? Uche Ajaere is the co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel. You may recognise the surname, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s a director of GIG Group.\n\nWhile the GIG Group is popularly known for the transport company, GIGM, it also has investments in other industries, including real estate. For over eight years, Uche has been involved in the operations of the real estate division. Simultaneously, he has kept an eye on developments in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nHis time working in real estate showed him that only a handful of people could afford to buy or own real estate. In Lekki, Lagos State, a four-bedroom duplex costs about \u20a6100 million ($173,913). This is out of the reach of most Nigerians who earn less than \u20a6150,000 ($300) annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, he decided on a startup that gives people a chance to own real estate regardless of how much they have.\n\nChallenges and competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s startup space has been in fintech, with a handful of other industries represented. The real estate sector has seen very little innovation, with startups like Spleet and Muster attempting to solve the issue of rent for Nigerians.\n\nOne reason for this is that technology does not entirely solve the problems in real estate. At best, it only aids processes. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in real estate is high. In addition, it could take as much as 15 years for investors to see a return on their investments. Consequently, it is not surprising that there is less investment going into real estate compared to other industries.\n\n\u201cPeople within the technology space will always think, \u2018how affordable is it to get this product? And how fast am I going to make my profit?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the promise of higher returns in other industries, why would anyone want to invest in real estate,\u201d Uche asks.\n\nThis high entry barrier is what Enterprise Hotel is working to eliminate. If, for example, a room in an Enterprise Hotel is going for \u20a630 million ($52,173), when it is split into 1,000 units, that amounts to about \u20a630,000 ($60), which is a lot more affordable for most Nigerians.\n\nIn addition to affordability, Enterprise Hotel says it offers investors an opportunity to get a return on their investment within two to four years. That\u2019s impressive because it takes about 15 to 20 years for most real estate acquisitions to return the initial capital outlay.\n\nEnterprise Hotel provides its investors with several ways to earn. The primary route is through hotel bookings. However, that is not all, as investors can make money from every activity that takes place in the rooms they own as well as other services offered in the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if a guest eats, drinks, or pays for dry cleaning services in the room, the investors also earn a cut of the earnings.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. One of the reasons many Nigerians buy land is that it often increases in value. Uche reveals that investments done through Enterprise Hotel would be evaluated with the value reflected on the app. Investors can also sell their properties, although Enterprise Hotel would require that they be given the right of first refusal on any property.\n\nAlready, Enterprise Hotel has properties in Lagos, Abuja, Benin, and Port Harcourt, with plans to add more across Nigeria. Uche reveals that the goal is to have an Enterprise Hotel in every major city in the world.\n\nFor Enterprise Hotel, building in a sector with little or no examples to follow could be tough. While there are startups currently offering fractional investment services in Nigeria, the majority are in the financial services space. Yet, a lot can be learnt from their success.\n\nAlthough Enterprise Hotel\u2019s model could see them offer real estate investment for as little as \u20a630,000 ($60), that is still a significant investment for most Nigerians. While the ability to invest small amounts is attractive, the reality is that the returns earned on such investments would be small, and this could discourage potential users. Therefore, it may be that the key to Enterprise Hotel\u2019s success lies in serving a market with higher disposable income.\n\nAttracting investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a startup like Enterprise Hotel requires enormous investments. So far, Enterprise Hotel has run without institutional investment. Uche discloses that while they are open to receiving investments, at the moment, the focus is on building significant traction before approaching investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just selling an app like other startups. We want to make sure that in the next few months when we\u2019re talking to investors, we\u2019ll be talking based on value. We want to show them the first set of hotels that we have built and investors who\u2019ve bought into them and are already making money. Then we can start talking to investors.\u201d\n\nAside from helping more people gain access to real estate investments, Enterprise Hotel indirectly solves another problem. Uche reveals that users can use it as collateral when applying for loans since they own the properties outrightly.\n\nIn Nigeria, where Enterprise Hotel operates, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals outside their preferred high net worth group. And in cases where they are willing to do so, they require collateral. Enterprise Hotel offers users a way out. They can now invest in real estate while using the assets as collateral.\n\nBuilding a business of any sort is challenging. For Enterprise Hotel, operating in the real estate industry with its high financial requirements poses a significant hurdle. However, the success of startups like Bamboo and Risevest suggest that Enterprise Hotel might be onto something.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "title": "Road to super app? GIGM adds e-wallet, bill payment features",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November",
          "text": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November\n\nThe ability of Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their various obligations is under more risk as gross monthly distribution by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the three tiers of government dropped by N68billion in November.\n\nFAAC allocation to the three tiers of government and public agencies amounted to N671.9bn ($1.62bn) in November (from October revenue), a decrease of 9.2 percent from the previous payout.\n\nData by Coronation Merchant Bank shows that the 9.2 percent decline in November FAAC was due to the decrease in the revenue from companies\u2019 income tax (CIT), petroleum profit tax (PPT), value-added tax (VAT), oil and gas royalties. Only excise duty recorded an increase over the previous month.\n\nThis means various state governments already impacted by low internal revenue may find it difficult to pay government workers or meet electorate promises without enough remittance from NNPC which form a large chunk of revenues shared at the FAAC meetings in Abuja.\n\nBreak down of the report by Coronation revealed that the FGN received a total of N284.3billion, state governments received N209.8billion, including N21.5billion representing the 13 percent derivation for the few oil-producing states and LGCs received N156.3billion.\n\nThe continuous decline in Nigeria\u2019s FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is also due to the subsidy payment, according to market analysts.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been deducting from its remittance to FAAC, a threat to the ability of many Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\u201cSince June \u201921, the corporation has deducted a total of N939bn from its FAAC remittance. It disclosed that it would deduct its October \u201821 value shortfall of N199bn from its November \u201821 proceeds,\u201d Chinwe Egwim, Chief Economist, Coronation, said.\n\nThe continuous payment of subsidy on petroleum products is likely to reduce the amount the government allocates to states and local governments as well as increase public debt, according to the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\nThe private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group said if the federal government continues to pay the subsidy on refined petroleum products; it could push Nigeria into a debt extension by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIncessant payment of subsidy on refined petroleum products would narrow FAAC allocations and widen the country\u2019s budget deficit. If this continues, the action could push Nigeria into a Debt Overhang\u201d by the end of 2021,\u201d the Lagos-based non-profit organization said.\n\nWhile Nigeria continues to channel huge resources to funding petrol subsidies, the country largely depends on borrowing to finance its capital and recurrent expenditure annually.\n\nNigeria\u2019s widening budget deficit has pushed the country\u2019s debt profile to jump 81 percent in four years to N35.465 trillion as of June 2021 from N19.636 trillion in 2017.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria\u2019s total public debt amounted to N35.47 trillion (about 86.5 million dollars).\n\nWhile crude oil prices rose by nearly 45 percent from January\u2019s price of $54.77 per barrel to $84.02 in November, Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy costs have risen 10 times faster at 488 percent, wiping out the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe Federal Government spent an estimated N149.28 billion subsidizing petrol in August, an increase of 488 percent compared with the N25.37 billion spent in January.\n\n\u201cThe federal government reluctant to regulate the downstream sector or even try to reduce the price of petrol has reflected market reality that has continued to be on the deficit on government revenue because the amount they need to subsidize PMS has continued to rise,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, Associate Investment Research in United Capital, said.\n\nAccording to Abdulazeez Kuranga, economist, Cordros Securities, the issue of subsidy payment was not in the budget when it was presented by the minister of finance, which means NNPC will continue to deduct the subsidy, and it will affect what NNPC will be remitting to FAAC, which in turn will limit what will be remitted to the government.\n\nWhile Nigeria has, for years, depended on borrowing to fund its revenue shortage, the World Bank says implementation of tax reforms, rationalization of generous concessions, expenditure can help the cash-strapped country raise as much as N10 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn the next three years, such measures can raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to about 7 percent and bring in as much as N10 trillion,\u201d the Washington-based lender said.",

          "text": "IHS, the largest tower company in Africa, may lose an eight-year-old N380 billion contract after MTN Nigeria required the deal to be denominated in the local currency, the naira.\n\nIHS controls many MTN Group tower assets in different parts of Africa including Nigeria. In 2014, IHS acquired 4,154 towers from MTN Nigeria and a further 4,696 towers in 2015. The transaction value of the deal was $52 billion.\n\nThe contract, which followed the acquisition of over 9,000 towers belonging to MTN in 2014, was denominated in dollars, but the recent depreciation of the naira and the acute dollar shortage in Nigeria are compelling MTN to force a change in the way the contract with IHS is priced. The tower service contract is arguably MTN\u2019s largest single-cost item.\n\nRead also: IHS buys MTN\u2019s towers, becomes largest asset owner in SA\n\nWhen the contract was first agreed almost 10 years ago, N160.37 fetched one US dollar on the official market but today MTN would require nearly three times as much in the local currency to buy one dollar where it is available. In the same way, the dollar value of MTN\u2019s annual revenues has fallen by the margin of naira\u2019s devaluation since 2014.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that MTN has told IHS in unclear terms that it could consider terminating the contract if an agreement on the dispute cannot be reached quickly.\n\nIHS recently went public on the New York Stock Exchange, which saw its valuation hit over $5 billion. The 9,000 towers from MTN Nigeria are more than 50 percent of IHS\u2019 tower assets in Nigeria at 16,522 towers. As of June 30, 2021, IHS operated 30,207 towers across five countries in Africa, three countries in Latin America, and one country in the Middle East.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to IHS for comments but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the deal.\n\nOlusola Teniola, former president, Association of Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON), says while it is within the rights of parties in an agreement to seek to renegotiate a contract, there are also clauses to respect. In the case of MTN Nigeria and IHS, the contract is long-term and it is one that is often renewed after a duration of 10 years. Teniola says he is confident both parties would resolve the challenge.\n\nMTN holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares of IHS Towers, representing about 20 percent of the tower company, as a result of the IPO.",

You are the ears and eyes that will give us more information that will help us fulfill all our electioneering promises. For those communities that we were unable to reach during our campaign, we will give them two SAs and one SSA.\n\n\u201cAs a governor, it\u2019s not possible to be in touch with all the communities, which is why I need you to coordinate your area for me.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi Osogbo\n\nOne of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aspirants in the forthcoming Osun governorship election, Mr Bamidele Adeleke, has picked his nomination form.\n\nAdeleke picked his nomination form Friday afternoon at the national headquarters of the party in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking after picking the form, Adeleke has said the state needed total re-engineering to make it functional again, just as he promised to re-engineer the state if elected.\n\nHe noted that the current \u2018mis-governance\u2019 of the APC needs to be reworked for the unfettered progress of the state.\n\nThe nephew of the candidate of the PDP in the 2018 governorship election in the state claims that the various policy shift and processes by the current administration which needs proper direction which he will provide.\n\nDele Adeleke added that he is ready to return the state to the hands of people by engaging in a mantra of true development.\n\nHe said: \u201cPDP delivered true development. Our party made sure development was closer to the people, while resource distribution was a lot more equitable through the autonomy and effectiveness of the Local Government in the management of their own affairs. Trunk C roads that served food producing communities and other rural locations were constructed and promptly maintained. However, what we have had since 2010 that the APC administration came, has been a moribund Local Government system. This is why rural dwellers are today living like they are not part of the Osun project. I dare say, that no State can truly develop without adequate Rural- Peri Urban \u2013 Urban integration.\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear to even the people who are in power today \u2013 Osun state needs urgent re-engineering. Financially, Administratively, Politically and Socially, we need a new direction, a new mindset, a new thinking and a new approach to solving our problems. We need a new order! This new order is what \u2018Dele Adeleke represents.\n\n\u201cI am coming into this race with three decades of hard-earned working experience in corporate financial re-engineering, project management and human resource management. My professional qualifications and proven track record of practical industry exposure have prepared me for challenging situations like the one Osun is presently mired, I am eminently qualified, competent and ready to undertake the re-engineering and repositioning that Osun so urgently needs. Therefore, I offer myself in service to be the vessel of upliftment, the ladder of ascension to the progress and prosperity of our beloved state.\n\n\u201cPicking up my nomination form is the first step in the long journey towards wrestling power from the incumbent APC. Having taken this first step, I declare my readiness to do all that it will constructively take, to win the confidence of all stakeholders, leaders and teeming party faithful to be elected as the PDP Flagbearer, go on to win the Governorship election and ultimately deliver great service to the people of our dear State.\n\n\u201cPlease join hands with me, support this movement to birth a new dawn of prosperity. Let us stand firm and undeterred in our conviction to set Osun on the path of sustainable development,\u201d Adeleke noted.\n\nAdeleke holds a B.SC in Management/Accounting and an MBA in General Management (distinction) both from Obafemi Awolowo University (Ile-Ife, Nigeria).

          "title": "2023: Arewa group seeks power shift to Southeast, says North now a human abattoir",
          "text": "A Northern group, Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organisations of Nigerian (ACCSON) has said that in the interest of fairness and equity, the Presidency in 2023 should go to the Southeast, even as it lamented that the North has turned into a human abbattoir under the incumbent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe group lambasted Alhaji Yerima Shettima, President of Arewa Consultative Youth Forum, describing a statement attributed to him to the effect that \u201cIt is too late for the 2023 Presidency to be zoned to the southeast,\u201d as \u201cindecorous and even outrightly provocative and inciting in nature.\u201d\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by Comrade Abdulsalam Mohammed Kazeem, the group\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nACCSON, umbrella body of over 40 CSOs, youth , students and women groups in the North, said it considered the said statement attributed to Yerima as a reckless one devoid of reason, empathy, and fairness.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that no genuine democrat with sincere national interest and who cherishes the spirit of unity and corporate existence of Nigeria will utter such insensitive comments at this critical political time in our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the records and for posterity, the said statement by Alhaji Yerima Shettima does not, in any way, represent the recent position of our umbrella youth coalition, the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organizations of Nigeria, that the Presidency of Nigeria in 2023 should be specifically zoned to the South East geo-political zone, in the interest of political equity and fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe openly made this declaration recently during the inauguration of our group at the Arewa House in kaduna. Therefore, the statement by Shettima stands condemned in it\u2019s totality by our group ACCSON, and we expect Nigerians and particularly the media to treat the statement purely as the personal opinion of Yerima Shettima, a former youth activist from our northern region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe basis of our position on the said statement credited to Shettima are as follows:That the Nigerian National Youth Policy (2009) described a youth as a person between the ages of 15 to 35 years-old. The African Youth Charter defines a youth as somebody within the age brackets of 15 to 35 years-old. While the United Nations categorized such person as one who is between 15 to 24 years-old respectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, going by the above definitions, Alhaji Yerima Shettima is not a youth and can not be classified as one. He is far above the age of 35 years, and as such, his statement remains a personal one and not that of the Arewa Youths.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy to restate here, that the position of our group, the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organizations of Nigeria (ACCSON) calling for the rotational presidency among the six geo political zones of the country was as a result of our peculiar regional experiences. Both past and present crop of elected and appointed leaders from within our region have failed us completely. They have failed to meet up with the expectations of our people, and have continued to betray our trust, confidence, and respect for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, from 1999 to date (which is 22 years now), the North West and North East Zones have produced president, Vice president, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Senate Presidents, and Speakers of the House of Representatives. The North Central Zone alone has produced two Senate Presidents in 12 years; a Deputy Senate president and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Our three zones of the northern region, in total, have produced more Ministers, Services Chiefs and Heads of Governments Agencies more than any other region, yet there is nothing on ground to show for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey only leverage on our population advantage, which though is an added advantage in a democratic setting. The said population is only useful to our region during electioneering period. The major benefit of a population advantage in economics is that it remains attractive to both the multi- national and trans-national companies that would want to site industries in such location in other to maximize their market and get very cheap labour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur northern region today has been reduced to a human abattoir, to say the least, where all our communities have been converted to a mass grave due to the failure of government at all levels. For instance, between October 2021 till date, over 150 citizens of northern extraction have been murdered by terrorists in Sokoto state alone, not to talk of Zamfara, Kebbi, Kaduna, Katsina, Niger, Benue, Borno and Yobe States. Despite the claims by government that terrorism and violent insurgency is aggressively being fought, the north has remained a killing field.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country is about the highest importer of Arms and Ammunition in Africa and our region is seemingly the poverty capital of Nigeria, yet our people occupied and are still occupying the most sensitive positions in government from 1999 till Date.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not sycophants of government, but we are patriotic northerners too, with history of respect for constituted authority and for our elders\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is therefore the position of our northern umbrella youths coalition, the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organizations of Nigeria (ACCSON), that since our people in leadership positions in Nigeria can not bring development, peace, progress, and prosperity to our region, let us try people of other regions, particularly the region or geo-political zone that has not produced a President or Vice president of Nigeria in other to further promote fairness, equity, unity or oneness of the country.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and former vice president of Uganda, Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, have in a joint article condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron Covid-19 variant.\n\nOver 20 of countries, mostly in Europe, North America and Asia, including the United Kingdom, banned travel from countries in Africa following the detection of the Omicron Coronavirus variant by South African scientists.\n\nObasanjo is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, while Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise, was the first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation.\n\nThe two leaders in the joint article published on Friday on The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\n\u201cWhat message was being sent? That each country by unilaterally bolting its gates will be able to hold back the tide of a pandemic, alone? That contributing to our global understanding of the evolution of a world plague, by sharing the fruits of years of genomic capabilities development, should lead to a country being ostracised?\u201d they inquired.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents\u201d.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, rather than issue travel bans, what the world needs \u201cin these Omicron times is smart multilateralism.\n\n\u201cEven after we had learnt that shutting the doors made no sense at this point, the emotive comfort of locking out the other proved too tempting to resist,\u201d they said.\n\nThe two leaders continued: \u201cYet, to run effective contact tracing in a time of rapid global physical connectivity, information and goodwill is required from countries far and near to plot the trajectory of a virus moving at the speed of flight. Detecting a variant in a person who happens to be from or at point A on the globe says nothing about all the other places the variant may have touched before eventually slipping into the cells of the unfortunate carrier.\n\n\u201cA very different form of global hyper-cooperation is required to match the pace of such a fast spreading virus. We in Africa have learnt the hard way that we are in an age where the old models of multilateralism have run their full course.\n\n\u201cMarked by slow bureaucracy and symbolisms of comity rather than pragmatic trust and modern instruments, this old multilateralism has frozen attempts to reform global trade to serve the people rather than corporations.\n\n\u201cIt has hobbled efforts to turn the energy transition into a moment to balance the obscene imbalances in population and consumption. And it has led to a world where annually we assemble in New York to address injustice and yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 threatened to disrupt Africa\u2019s biggest multilateral endeavour in half a century \u2013 the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) \u2013 \u2018radical agility\u2019 became our only path forward.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s embrace of smart multilateralism is manifest in being the first continent to agree on a common digital platform for bio-surveillance and biosecurity. Absolutely convinced that the each-for-herself idea embodied in border closures has serious limits, we set out to work with the private and civil society sectors to create both institutional and technological innovations to keep the borders open but the virus out.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of skillful compromises and modern technologies, we pressed on and ensured that the timeline for start of trading would be maintained. It was as clear as noonday to those of us championing African multilateralism that retreating behind the walls of nationalist survival would be continental suicide. It would also be generational suicide because COVID and AfCFTA are both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is smart multilateralism at work. It is the only way forward for a continent like ours that has long been marginalised in the global scheme of things. But the more we look at the state of globalisation in the world today, the more convinced we are that it is the whole world that needs smart multilateralism and not just Africa.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

This is another window of opportunities for the ongoing persuasive engagement with President Buhari by Ndigbo, to grant amnesty and Presidential pardons to all Ipob/ ESN and other Biafran agitators including Nnamdi Kanu and others who are languishing in numerous detention facilities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe group also tasked the south east governors to do everything possible to ensure that the release of Nnamdi Kanu is secured as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cSoutheast Governors led by Governor Umahi will secure the release of Nnamdi Kanu and others in Abakiliki. We have implicit confidence that the southeast political leadership and Igbo leadership led by Ohanaeze Ndigbo will seal the deal and facilitate the release of Nnamdi Kanu. It\u2019s predestined that Abakiliki is the venue where Ndigbo will secure the release of all detained freedom fighters including Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\n\u201cIPOB should without further delay rescind and withdraw the earlier decisions to obstruct the planned Presidential visit to Ebonyi State and disown the earlier provocative statements or unless that they want Nnamdi Kanu to remain in detention till the end of the year 2023 when another President will succeed Buhari.\n\n\u201cIPOB should apologize to Pa Mbazulike Amaechi and Southeast Governors for ignorantly hampering and thwarting their diplomatic and tactful efforts to secure the release of Nnamdi Kanu, as diplomatic ways remained the best approach to ensure that President Buhari will keep his previous promise to look for a political solution to the incarceration of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB should end all hostilities and resort to prayers and traditional ordinances until Presidential pardon and amnesty is given to all Biafran agitators,\u201d the group stated.",

          "text": "A coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have faulted media publications insinuating that internal wrangling in the military was responsible for the security challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe CSOs described such move \u201cas not only mischievous but highly misleading and ill motivated.\u201d\n\nThe CSOs including Arewa Youth Federation, Citizens Actions for Good Leadership and Northern Integrity Group of Nigeria while reacting to reports published by some media platforms said the claim was baseless and politically motivated.\n\nIn a statement signed by the trio of Adamu Matazu, Smart Kevin Mallam Usman Muhammad, the president, Convener and Executive Director of the groups respectively and made available to journalists, the CSOs wondered why anybody would make such spurious and unfounded accusation.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked to read a very demonic conspiracy concocted by enemies of Nigeria whose logic is not just imbecilic but kindergarten in all ramifications. To imagine that such trash is published in the Vanguard is mind boggling.\n\n\u201cThe press release is a handiwork of desperate and unpatriotic elements who are as dangerous to the nation as the monster we are confronting. To them, the 2023 elections is a must win. Their intention is to blackmail the government and security agencies just to get to power. They do not care the number of Nigerians dead as long as their quest for power is achieved,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe group said, \u201cGen. Yahaya Farouk, the Chief of Army Staff is a tested and trusted, no nonsense military personnel who has been in the theater of war in the northeast for a long time. Gen. S A Adebayo has been the Chief of Military Intelligence and has admirably vast experience and expertise. His contributions to decimate BokoHaram/ISAWP is well known.\n\n\u201cThroughout the history of Nigeria, the synergy within and between the armed forces and security agencies has been legendary, leading to the formation of joint operations and task forces with astonishing results. The outstanding successes in peace keeping operations all over the world are still fresh to Nigerians. This reality is no secret and does not need advertising. In the history of this war this is the first time the security agencies are jointly coordinating intelligence gathering and the war against terror.\n\n\u201cThe CSOs a what wranglings the group alludes, exist in the imagination of the group when the military has recorded tremendous success leading to the dead and capture of notorious bandits, destruction of their training and logistics bases. The thousands of of bandits who have surrendered to the superior fire power of the military are there for anyone to see.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable to imagine that a group of Nigerians who should know can actually come out and try to rubbish the military and allied security forces when we all know that the war against terror and all forms of criminality is being won through intelligence gathering, inter-agency coordination and information sharing throughout the country. The killing and destruction of leading BokoHaram commanders and their followers, destruction of their logistics bases attests to the success of the war against insurgency. The group and her sponsors is desperate to sow seeds of division in the ranks of the military.\u201d\n\nThey CSOs cautioned against making claims on internal wrangling \u201cwithout giving any specific details or data to back up cases of operational failures that could justify this bland accusation is highly uncalled for and not worthy of attention from discerning and learned Nigerians.\n\n\u201cFrom Operation Yaki, to Operation Hadin Kai, Operation Python Dance and all the military operations ever carried out in the country, there is always a mix of all the security agencies from the Police to Civil Defense to the military and members of the intelligence community. This is glaring, and a testimony to the synergy and cooperation within the security architecture in the country. To deny this is to accept one\u2019s insanity even before psychiatric evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe gains made in the war against terror in the northeast, northwest and secessionists elements in the southeast and southwest should tell every Nigerian that the security forces are working together and for the overall good of the country.\n\n\u201cThe coordinated military operations and the successes against terrorism and criminality in the country is a perfect testimony to the coordination and cooperation between the army.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be possible without sophisticated intelligence gathering, information evaluation and analysis. The attack on the intelligence unit tells us that the heat is on and the sponsors of terror are feeling the heat, hence their resort to blackmail and attempt to sow seeds of discord within the rank and file of the military. The precision in the airstrikes on terrorists hideouts and camps coupled with the decimation by ground soldiers is ample evidence to the hindsight of the intelligence unit.\u201d\n\nAccording to the coalition, \u201cThe allusion of mutiny is imaginary and exists only in the thinking of desperate people. The Nigerian Army and military at large is too disciplined to be swayed by the ignorance of some wailers and their sponsors who know nothing about military command and hierarchy. The military is determined and focused in confronting the insurgency and all forms of criminality in the country and will not be distracted by frivolous press releases from desperate politicians.\n\n\u201cNigerians must discountenance the press release from the group and continue to cooperate with security forces to further destroy these elements of disunity.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "\u2026Subsidy payment not sustainable \u2013 FG \u2026It\u2019ll increase cost of doing business \u2013 MAN \u2026Subsidy exclusion unavoidable \u2013 LCCI \u2026Govt should build new refineries \u2013 Expert \u2018\u2026No law provides for subsidy\u2019\n\nThe issue of petrol price increase is not new to Nigerians; rather what is new is that the federal government is bent on removing subsidy on petrol for good by 2022. BENJAMIN UMUTEME, in this piece, looks at the issue and its implications on the average citizen in the face of the prevailing harsh economic realities.\n\nIn January 2012, when former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration announced the removal of subsidy on petrol, it set the stage for the beginning of the end of his regime as Nigerians from all walks of life kicked against the decision. According to them, the living standard of the average Nigerian would be worse off. That was when the exchange rate still went for as low as N186/$. That was when oil prices were high and daily production was above 2 million barrels per day.\n\nTen years down the line, it is like the economic indices have gone full circle plus. Presently, the exchange rate at the parallel market is over N530/$, oil production due to OPEC+ production quota agreement is about 1.4 million, leading to a significant drop in foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria. This added to the near absence of infrastructure, reduced Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs) and to crown it all, the worsening insecurity which has significantly impacted negatively not just agriculture, but other forms of business. This is not forgetting to add that debt payment is eroding the government\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to the citizenry.\n\nEnter fuel subsidy removal talks, vows\n\nIt was a bolt out of the blue when the group managing director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, hinted that a litre of petrol may sell between N320 and N340 in 2022.\n\nThis hit the populace hard, and the reactions from Nigerians showed that they see the plan as further de-humanising the citizenry. According to Kyari, the government would exit the subsidy regime as the law does not provide for a subsidy; hence, its removal in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere will be no provision for it legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that the government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit in the subtlest and easiest manner,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Nigerians continue to wonder why the strong interest in petrol subsidy when subsidy for gas and kerosene has long been removed. The minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, was even blunter.\n\nSpeaking with State House correspondents in Abuja, the minister was adamant that the subsidy regime of the government was becoming unsustainable. She noted that it was becoming very difficult for the NNPC to fulfill its obligation to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cIf you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This money from the petroleum subsidies we can use to apply to health and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for the petroleum subsidy, if we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So, we are expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we are getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you to pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated.\n\n\u201cIn the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit the petroleum subsidy. So, this last FAAC the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\u201d\n\nNigerians, experts react\n\nThe argument for the removal of subsidy by the government has been going back and forth among Nigerians,\n\nFor the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), the proposal will increase not only the cost of doing business; it will also lead to fuel-induced inflation.\n\nAccording to its director-general, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, the implication is that with the strategic importance of petrol to business activities in the country, the cost of production will skyrocket.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the arguments back and forth on the issue, petrol remains a commercial product. It is, therefore, not insulated from the laws of demand and supply.\n\n\u201cFrom an economic point of view and that is the area I am comfortable to talk about, it should not come as a surprise. The rise in the price of crude oil should signal the inevitable increase in the landing cost of PMS in the country. You have oil marketers importing the fuel with the need to recover their costs and make a profit. Taken together, it is inevitable that the pump price of PMS will increase.\n\nHe, however, said fuel-induced inflation might arise, adding that it would also increase the cost of doing business for manufacturers and small business owners.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the cost of transportation \u2013 and the multiplier effect on other costs \u2013 that will accompany the more than 100 per cent increase will erode the disposable income of the average Nigerian.\u201d\n\nFor the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), the removal of subsidy was becoming more unavoidable looking at the pressure it places on the government revenue.\n\nIts director-general of LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, said spending up to N250 billion monthly on fuel subsidy at a time when the debt to revenue ratio was above 73 per cent was not economical.\n\nShe said an immediate implication of removing the subsidy would be the increase in transport and logistics which would translate into higher costs for goods and services, rising inflation, increased poverty from diminishing purchasing power, and a likely rise in the unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more money freed for other purposes, the government should be able to spend more on utilities to cushion the effects of the removal. With cost-reflective pricing, smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries will reduce due to reduced margins.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane, said while the removal of the subsidy would lead to lesser consumption due to increasing prices, the government would have extra funds to trigger economic growth.\n\nRewane, however, questioned the process and essence of the distribution of the N5,000 transport palliative to 40 million Nigerians, which would likely cost about N2.4tn in one year \u2013 an amount that is N600 billion short of the N3tn for fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cN5, 000 times 40 million is about N200bn a month. It is N2.4 trillion in one year. This means that the government wants to save N3tn to spend N2.4 trillion. Now, who are the 40 million people? For instance, I buy petrol, but I am not among those who will get N5, 000 a month. So, who are those 40 million to get this money? And how will it be disbursed?\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 take\n\nExperts are of the opinion that the proposed removal by the government is a little bit tricky, saying the authorities should be very tactful in order to prevent a social backlash. For many, the plan was coming at a very difficult time due to the harsh economic situation.\n\nOn his part, a former director-general of LCCI, Muda Yusuf, said the government must be creative in handling the issue. He said there was no doubt in the sound economic and business case in favour of fuel subsidy removal, \u201cbut the social and political contexts are equally critical.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cCertainly, the subsidy is not sustainable, which is why there is a need to accelerate engagement with the relevant stakeholders to come up with a policy transition strategy that is sustainable, realistic and pragmatic.\u201d\n\nOlamilekan Adefolarin, a political economist and development researcher, noted that the issue of subsidy removal boils down to poor leadership.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities are deficit as a developmental state. And this has impaired our level of national development especially if we have feeble leadership that is ready to implement neoliberal policies. This comes with loans and grants in return to adhere to anti-poor prescription such as removing subsidy on petrol.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the implication on small medium enterprises would firstly, increase their operational and overheads cost. Secondly, it would retard there business as some end up close shop. Thirdly, some SMEs without options may go into liquidation.\n\n\u201cFourthly, it could also lead to massive unemployment. Fiftly, this could also hamper the general health of the economy in all, we should expect the fall out to reverse whatever gains the government intervention fund disbursement to the SMEs in the year.\u201d\n\nPenny wise?\n\nSome Nigerians have described the second leg of the plan as penny wise, pound foolish. They wondered why the government would stop subsidies on petrol and pay N5, 000 to 40 million Nigerians. To cushion the effect on the citizens, the federal government said it would pay N5, 000 to vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nQuestioning the methodology for selecting the 40 million, the LCCI said the method of selecting the beneficiaries is faulty.\n\nShe said, \u201cOn the proposed N5, 000 to be given to some people, we always wonder how the selection is made and from what database or register. What is the guarantee that the money will end up with the right people needing the intervention? One of the biggest problems with our social investment programmes is that we do not have a systematic methodology on how beneficiaries are selected.\u201d\n\nEven for the NLC, \u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 30 and 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency, the vice-president, governors and a few of us ministers as members. So, we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So, the e-Naira will help, but also so are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is pay people in cash.\n\n\u201cSo, the transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it is meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months.\n\n\u201cSo, these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months; the minimum will be six months.\u201d\n\nThe minister, however, justified the replacement of petroleum subsidy with N5, 000 monthly transportation grants to the \u201cpoorest Nigerians.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that there was a need for the government to build new refineries to complement the ones already on ground.\n\n\u201cConversely, what should be the way forward is for the government to have the will to build new refineries to complement the on-going modular refineries being constructed but replicated across the country.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the Nigerian authorities must see the need to hinge on the development state principle instead of relying so much on market forces and orthodox theologies of price mechanism.\n\n\u201cThirdly, the Petroleum Industry Act law, the government must demonstrate total political will in making to work for all nigerians.PIA open door of opportunities that is not just regulation but making the government an active player in the sector providing petrol at accessible and affordable price for Nigerians through fair competitions as enshrined in the PIA objective,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Along with the new restrictions, the British government is offering everyone 18 and up a third, booster dose of vaccine to try to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe emergence of omicron, which is spreading quickly in Britain, has shaken the government\u2019s hopes that vaccinations would be enough to keep the virus in check. British scientists and officials say omicron spreads more quickly than the currently dominant delta variant and likely is more resistant to current vaccines. It is not yet clear whether it causes more severe, or milder, cases off COVID-19.\n\nFace masks are once again compulsory in indoor public spaces in England under the measures British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this week to slow the spread of the new omicron virus variant. Vaccination passes will be needed for nightclubs and large events starting next week, and residents will be told to work from home, if possible.\n\nTighter restrictions to curb the coronavirus came into force in Britain on Friday, as the government faced new allegations that officials flouted rules they had imposed on the nation with lockdown-breaking parties last Christmas.\n\nThe return of restrictions is unwelcome for many, and revelations of apparent rule-breaking by government officials during tough lockdowns last winter have heightened opposition to the new measures.\n\nThe government has asked Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant to investigate several gatherings, including a Dec. 18, 2020, event at the prime minister\u2019s 10 Downing St. offices, where staff reportedly enjoyed wine, food, games and a festive gift exchange at a time when pandemic regulations banned most social gatherings.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported Friday that one of Johnson\u2019s most senior advisers, Director of Communications Jack Doyle, attended the Dec. 18 party and gave awards to staff members. At the time, he was the deputy communications director.\n\nIn his current role, Doyle has directed the government\u2019s public statements about the party allegations. For several days, Johnson\u2019s office denied a party had taken place and insisted rules had been followed at all times.\n\nThat claim unraveled when a leaked video showed senior staff members joking about the alleged party. The most senior official in the video, Allegra Stratton, apologized and resigned on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult week for the government,\u201d Paul Scully, the U.K.;s small business minister, said Friday adding that the investigation needed to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe want to see beyond doubt that there were no rules broken, which is what the assurances have been to the prime minister, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Scully told the BBC. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Christmas party claims are the latest in a string of allegations of rule-breaking and ethics violations by Johnson and government officials. On Thursday, Britain\u2019s electoral watchdog fined the prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party 17,800 pounds ($23,500) for failing to keep a proper record of money from a donor that was used to refurbish Johnson\u2019s official residence.\n\nWes Streeting, health spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the stream of allegations undermined trust in the government during a public health crisis.\n\nStreeting blamed Johnson, saying \u201cit\u2019s his untrustworthy nature, his disorganization, his dishonesty, which is undermining trust in public health measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s character and behavior starts to undermine a whole series of things: the system of standards in Parliament, the way the law is applied in the country and crucially, whether the government can get its message across about public health at a critical time,\u201d Streeting said.",

          "text": "Apparently jolted by recent killings in Sokoto and Katsina states by terrorists, President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday dispatched a high-level five-man security delegation, made up of the heads of the nation\u2019s intelligence and security services, to the two states, with a mandate for quick recommendations on how to end the carnage.\n\nOn the same day, hundreds of youths stormed the streets of Kano State, with banners and placards, protesting mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, the Buhari delegation, led by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Munguno (rtd) was sent to Sokoto and Katsina states in response to the spike in activities of terrorists.\n\nOther members of the delegation are the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba; the Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi; the Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar and the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo.\n\nThe President is expecting an immediate situation report and recommendations on actions to follow to effectively deal with the worrisome situation.\n\n\n\nTerrorists have been ravaging Sokoto State for almost three years, with several local government areas under the control of the outlaws. Daily, scores are killed, many abducted and houses burnt in these places.\n\nLast Thursday, three people were killed by extremists who invaded Kurawa village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe attack occurred hours after Governor Aminu Tambuwal visited the area on a condolence visit to the families of travellers burnt to death by terrorists last Sunday.\n\nJust last Monday, scores were killed when the terrorists struck in Gidan Bawa village, Isa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nDuring the attack, the terrorists burnt 23 travellers in a bus heading to Kaduna.\n\n\n\nIn Katsina State, the terrorists are active in virtually all the local government areas. Worst hit are Kurfi, Dutsinma, Matazu, Musawa, Malumfashi, Dandume, Bakori, Funtua, Kafur and Danja.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Katsina State Commissioner of Science and Technology, Dr. Rabe Nasir, was killed in his House located at Fatima Shema Quarters, Katsina.\n\nOne of the residents, who does not want his name in print, said: \u201cThe gunmen stormed the house at night and attacked him. They killed him and locked his corpse up in one of the rooms where we discovered it today (Thursday).\u201d\n\nNasir, 61, a former member of the House of Representatives, was also a former official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nThe Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has persistently expressed worries about the security challenges bedeviling the state, noting that 10 out of 34 local government areas of the state are under persistent attacks by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nHe affirmed that the deteriorating spate of banditry, kidnapping, rape and armed robbery were clogs in his government\u2019s effort at restoring peace and normalcy in the state.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the state by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, he said: \u201cWe here in Katsina, if we say we are very happy, we are not being honest. We are disturbed with this issue of banditry accompanied with kidnapping, raping of innocent women, armed robbery on our highways. I want technology to be properly deployed to bring these activities under control.\n\n\u201cTen out of 34 local governments in Katsina State are under severe bandits\u2019 attacks daily. So, with that in mind, there is no way we can sleep. Our phones are permanently on to hear what is happening in local governments. Before breakfast, I am briefed about what happened last night. So, General, we are not in a very comfortable situation but we thank God.\u201d President Buhari yesterday expressed sadness over the gruesome killing of Nasir, vowing to bring the culprits to justice. He has ordered a manhunt for those behind the urder.\n\nHe said death of the commissioner had illuminated the need for all and sundry, agencies, organisations and institutions to understand the gravity of the security challenges and the need to forestall future occurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe president\u2019s security delegation, led by Monguno, condoled with the government and people of the state over the incident.\n\nMonguno noted that the nation had been gripped by the news of the tragic incident and that efforts were on to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gruesome murder of Dr. Rabe Nasir, a serving commissioner in Katsina State, is a great loss, not only to Katsina State, but also to the entire nation.\n\n\u201cMr. President has the confidence that the Nigeria Police Force will uncover those who perpetrated the crime and the proper criminal justice and the process of the law will take place and these people will be brought to book.\n\n\u201cThis has illuminated the need for all of us in this country, whatever agency, organisation or institution to understand the gravity of this sought of incident and to ensure not only to forestall such incidents in the future but to actually reach an end stage.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMr. President wants me and the members of our delegation to reassure you of his commitment to ensure safety and security of individuals and institutions. Mr. President is deeply touched and shocked over this sort of assassination.\u201d\n\nResponding, Masari, challenged security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of the act in order to face the wrath of the law. Hundreds of youths yesterday in Kano besieged the government house roundabout with banners and placards in peaceful protest over mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe protesters carried placards with different inscriptions, asking President Buhari to act immediately.\n\nThey marched from Audu Bako secretariat to Kano Government House, where security operatives received the group of protesters, listened to them and promised to take the matter further to the appropriate quarters.\n\nThe Convener of the protest, Zainab Naseer Ahmad, lamented how insecurity was threatening the lives and livelihood of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe come to share our concern and send a message to our leaders; we are tired of the worsening state of insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nThe protesters, chanting songs of peace, called on President Buhari and the governors to show more interest in tackling insecurity.\n\nThere has been outrage in the North since terrorists burnt alive some travellers in Sokoto State early in the week.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",
          "summary": "Terrorists have been ravaging Sokoto State for almost three years, with several local government areas under the control of the outlaws.\nLast Thursday, three people were killed by extremists who invaded Kurawa village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\nLast Wednesday, the Katsina State Commissioner of Science and Technology, Dr. Rabe Nasir, was killed in his House located at Fatima Shema Quarters, Katsina.\nHe said: \u201cThe gruesome murder of Dr. Rabe Nasir, a serving commissioner in Katsina State, is a great loss, not only to Katsina State, but also to the entire nation.\nThere has been outrage in the North since terrorists burnt alive some travellers in Sokoto State early in the week.",

          "text": "Former NIgeria president Olusegun Obasanjo and the former vice-president of Uganda, Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, have condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nA number of countries in Europe banned travel from countries in Africa following the discovery of the variant by South African scientists.\n\nObasanjo is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, while Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise, was the first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation.\n\nSpeaking on the development regarding Omicron, the duo, in a joint article published yesterday in The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\n\u201cWhat message was being sent? That each country by unilaterally bolting its gates will be able to hold back the tide of a pandemic, alone? That contributing to our global understanding of the evolution of a world plague, by sharing the fruits of years of genomic capabilities development, should lead to a country being ostracised?\u201d they asked.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, rather than issue travel bans, what the world needs \u201cin these Omicron times is smart multilateralism.\n\n\u201cEven after we had learnt that shutting the doors made no sense at this point, the emotive comfort of locking out the other proved too tempting to resist,\u201d they said.\n\nThe two leaders continued: \u201cYet, to run effective contact tracing in a time of rapid global physical connectivity, information and goodwill is required from countries far and near to plot the trajectory of a virus moving at the speed of flight. Detecting a variant in a person who happens to be from or at point A on the globe says nothing about all the other places the variant may have touched before eventually slipping into the cells of the unfortunate carrier.\n\n\u201cA very different form of global hyper-cooperation is required to match the pace of such a fast spreading virus. We in Africa have learnt the hard way that we are in an age where the old models of multilateralism have run their full course.\n\n\u201cMarked by slow bureaucracy and symbolisms of comity rather than pragmatic trust and modern instruments, this old multilateralism has frozen attempts to reform global trade to serve the people rather than corporations.\n\n\u201cIt has hobbled efforts to turn the energy transition into a moment to balance the obscene imbalances in population and consumption. And it has led to a world where annually we assemble in New York to address injustice and yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 threatened to disrupt Africa\u2019s biggest multilateral endeavour in half a century \u2013 the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) \u2013 \u2018radical agility\u2019 became our only path forward.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s embrace of smart multilateralism is manifest in being the first continent to agree on a common digital platform for bio-surveillance and biosecurity. Absolutely convinced that the each-for-herself idea embodied in border closures has serious limits, we set out to work with the private and civil society sectors to create both institutional and technological innovations to keep the borders open but the virus out.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of skillful compromises and modern technologies, we pressed on and ensured that the timeline for start of trading would be maintained. It was as clear as noonday to those of us championing African multilateralism that retreating behind the walls of nationalist survival would be continental suicide. It would also be generational suicide because COVID and AfCFTA are both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is smart multilateralism at work. It is the only way forward for a continent like ours that has long been marginalised in the global scheme of things. But the more we look at the state of globalisation in the world today, the more convinced we are that it is the whole world that needs smart multilateralism and not just Africa.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY",

          "text": "With barely 18 months to the end of his eight-year rule, President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday assured the international community of the readiness of his government to hand over power to winners of free and fair general election in 2023.\n\nHe also lamented that democratic rule in the West African sub-region \u201cis currently being threatened by undemocratic takeover of government by the military.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a Virtual Summit on Democracy organised by President Joe Biden of the United States, President Buhari said necessary mechanisms would be strengthened to ensure that Nigeria witnessed another peaceful transfer of power by May 29, 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we countdown to our next general elections in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\n\u201cI am proud to state that Nigeria has had over two decades of uninterrupted democratic governance and has unequivocally remained committed to upholding the core values and principles of democracy.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, we have been able to introduce mechanisms to ensure free, fair and credible elections. We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria continues to face security challenges which pose a threat to democracy, and therefore called on global partners to support Nigeria\u2019s efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Biden, government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far. It is one governance system that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusiveness in governance. It also promotes social justice, economic and social development and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u201d the President said.\n\nHe also noted that the summit was taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\n\u201cThis event will help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies today. It is hoped that through our collective action, we can safeguard democratic values and principles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made it impossible to convene the meeting face to face, had taken a heavy toll on economies, health and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions.\u201d\n\nWhile pledging Nigeria\u2019s support for democratic governance in West Africa, Buhari, however, expressed concern about the threat of undemocratic take-over of government in the sub region.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region West Africa and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s billionaire magnate and chair of Geregu Power Plc Femi Otedola has acquired a further interest in FBN Holdings Plc, the parent company of Nigeria\u2019s oldest lender First Bank, an affirmation that the heated battle for the soul of the financial services group among its principal shareholders is not yet over.\n\nMr Otedola acquired at least 2.5 per cent additional interest in the company, bringing his total stake to 7.57 per cent. Mr Otedola previously made piecemeal acquisitions summing up to 5.07 per cent.\n\nThe purchase will formally consolidate his position as the single biggest shareholder of FBN Holdings, placing him well ahead of his closest rival Tunde Hassan-Odukale, FirstBank\u2019s chairman, whom he has come in contention with since the news of his share acquisitions broke into the open late October.\n\nMr Otedola\u2019s earlier move spurred Mr Hassan-Odukale to swiftly lay claim to 5.36 per cent shareholding in the holdco in what he called \u201ccumulative equity stake\u201d drawn from a combination of his direct, indirect and related party shareholding in the group.\n\nDays after, the board of FBN Holdings issued a letter seen by PREMIUM TIMES to the Corporate Affairs Commission, notifying Hassan-Odukale\u2019s \u201c5.36 per cent\u201d cumulative stake and other related details.\n\nBut the controversial aspect of his declaration, particularly his claim to 1.05 per cent stake held by Leadway Pensure PFA, a company owned by Mr Hassan-Odukale, attracted disapproval from the NGX and the National Pension Commission.\n\nThe wrangle around the claim lies in how an equity investment from a pool of employees\u2019 pension contributions could qualify as a single individual\u2019s investment.\n\nWhile the NGX queried FBN Holdings in October, asking it to explain what it meant by \u201ccumulative equity stake\u201d and Mr Hassan-Odukale\u2019s claim to investment by Leadway Pensure PFA, the pension office late affirmed that shares of FBN Holdings Plc belong to Retirement Savings Account holders, and not a third party as FBN Holdings had claimed.\n\nThat technically puts Hassan-Odukale\u2019s interest in the entity at 4.31 per cent after deducting the controversial stake.",
