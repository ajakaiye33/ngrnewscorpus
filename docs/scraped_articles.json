          "text": "THE International Press Centre has kicked against attempts by the government to criminalise journalism in the country, urging media professionals to fight before it is too late.\n\nThe Executive Director of the centre, Lanre Arogundade, noted that there were two major bills before the National Assembly which could cripple press freedom in Nigeria.\n\nHe identified them as the National Broadcasting Commission Amendment Bill and the Nigerian Press Council Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that the bills for amendment of the NBC Act were sponsored by Odebunmi Olusegun (APC, Oyo State and Chairman, House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values) and Unyime Idem (PDP, Akwa Ibom State and Deputy Chairman, House Committee on Communication); the NPC amendment bill is sponsored by Olusegun.\n\nArogundade, who spoke to The PUNCH on Sunday on the telephone, said if the media refused to act on time and the amendments scaled through, media houses could become an appendage of the Federal Ministry of Information.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have discovered that some of the amendments being proposed in the two bills are major threats to press freedom should they be passed into law. We are saying this because there is an attempt to criminalise journalism. The penalties for the alleged breach of the codes in the NBC and NPC acts are highhanded and heavy, sometimes up to N10m in the case of the NPC Act and even imprisonment for three years for any form of alleged violations.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the NBC Act, there is a provision that the NBC can sanction a station, including fine or revocation of licence, if in the opinion of the NBC, it is in public interest. You now begin to wonder how a proposed law would give power of determining public interest to an unelected body.\u201d\n\nThe IPC director also questioned why the National Assembly usually confirmed the board appointments of all regulatory bodies in Nigeria, except the media.\n\nHe said this was giving the Information Ministry undue control of the press.\n\n\u201cThe NPC Act is so ridiculous that the proposed amendment is saying that a National Press Code shall be drawn up and the code will come into effect only with the approval of the Minister of Information. So, they are saying in effect that all newspapers are a department of the Ministry of Information,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the National Assembly must act as true representatives of Nigerians and not to serve the selfish interest of a few people.\n\nAccording to him, a breach of press freedom in any form is denying the people the right to know.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "COVID-19: African economies won\u2019t revive until vaccination deficiency addressed \u2014 AfDB",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026 Raises alarm over continent\u2019s worsening debts challenge, effects of insecurity on development\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has warned that the economies of countries in Africa will continue to remain in jeopardy until the continent finds an answer to the COVID-19 vaccination debacle.\n\nPresident of the AfDB, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, stated this on Saturday while addressing the Economic Community of West African States\u2019 (ECOWAS) Authority of Heads of State and Government in Accra, Ghana.\n\nHe harped on the need for the continent to take the challenge to start the production of its own vaccines, not just for COVID-19, but also to create a safeguard against future outbreaks.\n\nThe AfDB boss, however registered the continental financial institution\u2019s bank to collaborate with countries in Africa to buoy up the health sector shopping for support to start the production of a vaccine in Africa, working with the African Union (AU), adding that the bank would commit $3 billion to the development of the pharmaceutical industry on the continent.\n\nWhile giving perspective to the financial risk that the menace of unconquered COVID-19 pandemic poses to the continent, especially the West African subregion, he said emphasised the need for leaders of the continent to immediately commence strengthening the defenses of the health sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe African Development Bank moved very quickly to launch a $10 billion facility to support countries. We also launched a $3,000,000,000 to fight COVID social bond on the global capital markets, which was the largest social bond ever in world history. Now things, are looking up again.\n\n\u201cThe African Development Bank projects for Africa GDP growth will rebound to 3.4%. This year, and West Africa GDP growth is projected to recover from minus -1.5% in 2020, to 2.8% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022. But the rebound will depend on access to vaccines, Africa should not be begging for vaccines, Africa should be producing vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe African Development Bank will ramp up support for Africa to produce vaccines as part of the vaccines plan for the African Union. The bank will also commit $3 billion to develop the pharmaceutical industry in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to rapidly build a healthcare defense system for Africa to tackle this and future pandemics. The African Development Bank plans to invest in building quality healthcare infrastructure in Africa.\u201d\n\nAdesina raised the alarm over the alarming debt challenge of the African continent, calling particular attention to the situation in the West African subregion.\n\nHe, however, proffered a solution to the crisis of debts, which he said low-income West African countries would need as much as $245 billion to fix, advising that there already appeared to be a relief presented through the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), offered by the G7 countries.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must also now tackle the debt challenge facing the subregion and indeed the and indeed all of Africa. Africa will need significant financial support. Low-income Sub-Saharan African countries will need $245 billion by 2030 in additional gross financing, while the whole of sub-Saharan Africa will need $425 billion over the same period.\n\n\u201cWe now have a real opportunity to tackle Africa\u2019s debt challenges more decisively with the recent decision of the IMF to issue Special Drawing Rights, otherwise called SDRs. The G7 Global Leader Summit, which followed your call for this, or the Paris meeting on financing, gave the green light for allocating $100 billion of SDR to Africa. This will open the way for much bigger relief for Africa.\n\n\u2018As agreed in Paris, during the Financing for Africa Economic Summit, the heads of state called for the African Development Bank to receive SDRs on behalf of African countries as well as to use them to own land to public development banks.\n\n\u2018It will also be important that some of the SDRs in Africa be used to buy down some of the very expensive debt owed to private creditors. These will help to avoid a looming crisis or payments to private bondholders due in 2023/2024 which if not addressed could lead to massive credit downgrades across Africa.\n\n\u201cYour excellences we must now put in place an African Financial Stability Mechanism to protect the continent against external shocks. This mechanism is critical, it will require that we must realise our resources, avoid regional spillover effects, regionalize fiscal policy works, develop homegrown reforms and debt resolution approaches and provide a regional safety-net that will compliment the global safety-net of the International Monetary Fund.\u201d\n\nAdesina also hinted on the plan to relieve the West African subregion of the burden of violence and insecurity, factors which he observed had been taking serious tolls on the development drives by the most affected countries of the region, especially in the Sahel region and the Chad Basin area.\n\n\u201cYour excellences, when we resolve Africa\u2019s debt challenges, I can rest just a little. One thing will still keep me awake at night; Africa\u2019s rising insecurity. As you well know, the situation is most precarious in the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, but I\u2019m sure Your Excellencies it keeps you also awake at night.\n\n\u201cThe trend is disturbing as expenditures from defense are rising fast, displacing financing for development. Your Excellencies, the investable space in Africa is rapidly shrinking due to insecurity. Take the case of Mozambique, where the African Development Bank helped to structure a $24 billion deal for its liquefied natural gas project.\n\n\u201cThis transaction won the global project deal of the year 2020 Award. This will have made Mozambique the third largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world with projected revenues of $66 billion. Alas, terrorists have now invaded the location Total, the major project sponsor, has just declared force majeure and has pulled out.\n\n\u201cThese insecurity situations and insurgencies now pose the biggest risks to Africa\u2019s development, yet countries lack adequate resources to effectively tackle these challenges. If unaddressed quickly, insecurity will become a huge risk to our dream of an African Continental Free Trade dream.\n\n\u201cIt is time to adapt our approach. Your Excellencies, we must now link security to investment, growth and development. That\u2019s why the African Development Bank calls for the development of Security Indexed Investment Bonds, taking advantage of lower long-term interest rates.\n\n\u201cThese security index investment bonds will allow Africa to leverage resources on the global capital markets to reinforce its security. The revenue streams from the Security Indexed Investment Bonds can be used to, one, reinforce the security architecture of African countries and support dual-purposed infrastructure to enhance national and regional peacekeeping and security capabilities.\n\n\u201cTwo, build destroyed or damaged infrastructure in conflict-affected areas and finance new investment projects to relaunch economic activities and create jobs in areas prone to security challenges.\n\n\u201cThree, build social infrastructure for the populations, especially water, sanitation, schools, health, roads, ICT and agricultural infrastructure, to enable to access to basic services to support community livelihoods in fragile environments, and four, protect strategic investments within countries or regions.\n\n\u201cThe Security Indexed Investment Bond can be delivered through special purpose vehicles established on behalf of a pool of regional member countries. The plans can be credit-enhanced by the African Development Bank or other donors. The administration of the bond process can be managed by the office under the auspices of the African Union\u2019s Peace and Security Council, and regional economic communities, which includes ECOWAS Commission\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Amidst the falling piracy incidence in the Nigerian waters and the Gulf of Guinea since February when the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) deployed the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure popularly known as the Deep Blue Project, the Director General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety agency (NIMASA), Dr Bashir Jamoh has expressed worry over the persisting War Risk Insurance on Nigerian bound cargoes, calling for its removal.\n\nThis came as it has been disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s maritime trade is to say the least threatened due to the increasing war risk insurance premium now being paid by Nigeria-bound vessels.\n\nAlthough according Dr. Jamoh piracy in the Nigerian waters is waning, stakeholders in the industry are worried that offshore underwriting firms still insist on very high premium to be paid by those conveying cargoes to Nigeria.\n\nWar risk insurance is a type of insurance, which covers damage due to acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. Some policies also cover damage due to weapons of mass destruction. It is most commonly used in the shipping and aviation industries.\n\nIt generally has two components: War Risk Liability, which covers people and items inside the craft and is calculated based on the indemnity amount; and War Risk Hull, which covers the craft itself and is calculated based on the value of the craft. The premium varies based on the expected stability of the countries to which the vessel will travel, the war risk phenomenon, which was only known to countries with high rate of piracy such as Somalia, also found its way into Nigeria following massive involvement of youths in the Niger Delta in militant activities.\n\nSpeaking during the recent official flag-off of the deep blue project in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari, Dr Bashir said: \u201cSince the deployment of the deep blue project assets in February, there had been a steady decline in piracy attacks in the Nigerian waters on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe therefore invite the international shipping community to rethink the issue of war risk insurance on cargo bound for our ports. Nigeria has demonstrated enough commitment towards tackling maritime insecurity to avert such premium burden,\u201d Jamoh said.\n\nAccording to nonprofit Oceans Beyond Piracy\u2019s 2020 reports, the total cost of additional war risk area premiums incurred by Nigeria bound ships transiting the Gulf was $55.5 million in 2020 alone, and 35 per cent of ships transiting the area also carried additional kidnap and ransom insurance totaling $100.7 million.\n\nInsecurity got so bad in the region before the deployment of the deep blue project that global insurance firm Beazley now offers \u201cGulf of Guinea Piracy Plus,\u201d a bespoke insurance plan for maritime crew travelling through the area.\n\nThe plan provides compensation for illegal vessel seizures and crew kidnappings even in the absence of ransom demands. It tracks insured vessels on a 24-hour basis, but because the risks are so high, it limits claims to $25 million.\n\nA spokesman for Beazley disclosed that premiums for this type of coverage are decided on a case-by-case basis, however, because the risks are so great.",

I saw the virus itself and it is a spiritual affliction from Marine Spirit with a very simple mass healing Spiritual Solution with the power of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI became aware and serious of my situation when the voice said \u2013\u2018I am God Almighty talking to you; I have clothed you with the power of the Holy Spirit for your blessing to do my work; Command the river around you to change its direction of flow and it will obey you; concentrate on my work; the time is against us; move out and get it done else you will suffer the same fate as that of Zachariah in Luke 1:Vs. 5-25.\u201d\n\nFor his reluctance over time, he suddenly lost his three cars to inferno on a single day and hour.\n\nHis fortunes started taking a downward turn, saying; \u201cEverything I was doing for a living disappeared. I knew for sure that I will not be able to escape the ordeal so I started to go about conducting healing crusades in Port Harcourt, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom and Benue states.\u201d\n\nHe said even by telephone from a distance, he would pray into a bottle of water in your hand and the spirit of God will do her work and bring healing to any disease afflicting the person.\n\n\u201cI do exactly what the voice told me to do by commanding a whole river or ordinary drinkable water and whosoever drink of it will cause instant destruction of the Aids Virus. The proof of dead viruses will be seen as slimy mucus; strange color or heavy foam in the urine of the victim within few hours of drinking the water. This is the mystery surrounding my mission on earth.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that \u201cthe victim will start to live a normal life without drugs, no more aches, and pains. The body will start to germinate between 20 to 50 new blood cells every month to replace the damaged immune system known as the CD4 lymphocyte count; which controls the HIV-Negative status.\u201d\n\nHe said he is ready to visit every corner of the world to free the victims.\n\nHe added that healing comes from God, not him and that the treatment is available even through a telephone call.",

I think I raised my kids differently. Children love validation. My kids can talk to me and express themselves very well. I had to make them know that their mother is a superhero. I explained that it was a painful experience that happened when their mum was very young\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey understood even though they might not know the gravity of what it was.

          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nAnthony Cardinal Okogie, Emeritus Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos has again berated the government as he lamented the state of the nation, saying Nigeria is practically becoming a failed state.\n\nSpeaking at his 85th birthday Thanksgiving Mass and 50th Episcopal Ordination Anniversary at Church of Assumption Falomo, Lagos recently, Okogie said the Nigerian people has never had it so bad compared to what they have experienced under the present administration; even as it was outrageous when president Muhammadu Buhari announced that Nigerians has been better of under his watch in the last six years; during his anniversary.\n\nOkogie insisted that state of anarchy is looming and harped on the need avoid it. With almost all parts of the country being challenged with insecurity and insurgency, which is a sign of failure.\n\n\u201cAs they say, matters speak for itself is a proof that Nigeria is practically slipping into a failed state. A country fails when it is no longer able to protect its citizens from harm and secure their welfare\u2019, \u2018A country fails when instead of being a harbor of its citizens, it turns out to be a conundrum of fire and sorrow that consumes its citizens\u2019\n\n\u2018A country fails when instead of reassuring its citizens by actions and policies that the future is secure, it becomes a case of most people planning to flee the country to other climes where their government are truly functioning. Such is practically our case today.\u201d\n\nOkogie, a former president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) agreed that the problem did not start under this administration, but very disturbing is that there has not been any \u201carticulate coordinated response from government to tackle the situation apart from sitting on the fence, playing the ostrich and throwing tantrums.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed the problems did not start with this administration, it seems to have worsened economically and politically in the past six years. The insurgency in the North East is still ongoing and insecurity has spread nationwide despite of the military being deployed everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe avalanche of banditry and kidnapping that has overwhelmed parts of the North West and central cannot be described as they stroll casually into school and cart away tens to hundreds of students and mysteriously melt into nearby forest or bushes; the entire security apparatus often seems clueless or helpless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation in some part of the South East also leaves much to be desired, with the officers mobbed, soldiers butchered, innocent citizens killed, properties destroyed, people are no longer safe in the land.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnknown gunmen have become our favorite vocabulary in our parlance as they come in and out, operate untraceable. The case of the Fulani herdsmen has been badly handled so far. Cases of unemployment, inflation, poverty and misery are shooting from the roof. The sad part is that there is no articulate coordinated response from government to curb these downward trends apart just sitting on the fence, playing the ostrich and throwing tantrums when they are criticized like the rather harsh suspension of Twitter\u201d.\n\nOkogie therefore called on government at all levels to rise up to the situation and save this nation from drowning.\n\n\u201cLet them listen to the cries of the people. Politics of exclusion, exploiting the nations ethnic, regional and religious diversity cannot help the citizens.\u201d\n\nFelicitating with the clergy man was the governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu who was represented by the special adviser on Religious Matters, Very Rev. Bukola Adeleke. He said the church under the leadership of Okogie recorded tremendous successes to show that the church is a stakeholder of governance in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "From Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, has warned leaders to stop profiling Nigerian youths \u2018as criminals or cultists\u2019 and other such \u2018demeaning appellations\u2019.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, such negative labels and the reluctance of the older generation to create space for the young people in governance and the economy have lowered their self-esteem and are largely responsible for the youth restiveness witnessed in the country.\n\nSpeaking at the weekend in Uyo at the National Dialogue to mark 2021 Democracy Day organised by the Civil Liberties Organisations (CLO) in conjunction with the Office of Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Enang blamed the government for using and abandoning the youths without providing them with jobs.\n\nHe urged the government to apologise to the youths, saying \u2018it is time to have meaningful dialogue with the youths of this state and country and practically give them roles and space in the Governance and economy of this state and country.\n\n\u2018We should not profile them as criminals or cultists nor such derogatory nor demeaning appellations that give them low self or societal esteem.\n\n\u2018Doing so ostracises them and embolden them to form camps, carry arms and do the worst. This please is in view of the peculiar times, and not the norm for all times. We should not profile nor stigmatise them,\u2019 he noted.\n\nThe presidential aide, who also called for a national dialogue every five years to tackle the challenges the country faces, said the dialogue would help the six geo-political zones in the country express their grievances and reach a compromise that would help to move the nation forward.\n\nEmphasising that the voices of discord and discontent across the country are getting louder and need to be addressed, Enang said the national conference would not take over the functions of the government but serve as feedback from the people.\n\nAlso speaking, a federal legislator representing Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Onofiok Luke, cautioned President Buhari against ignoring the various agitations coming out from the South East and South West regions.\n\nLuke, who is the Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, expressed disappointment that much has been said but nobody is listening to the various voices of reason in the country.\n\n\u2018It is by coming together to share ideas and share thoughts beyond party lines, taking a bipartisan approach, bringing together men and women who have leaders touch, one solution or the other, one idea or the other that we could all fine-tune and push the agenda for the development of this country.\n\n\u2018I have always been an advocate for a bipartisan approach to the problems of this country. The problem we are facing doesn\u2019t know party, it doesn\u2019t know region, religion.\n\n\u2018Now the security crisis we are experiencing in the South East, we have had a case of that crisis in North West. We have had students kidnapped from Schools, and those students are not Christians, those students are Muslims.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had this crisis happen in states that are not APC, we have had it happen in states that are PDP. And the people affected by this crisis are the Nigerian populace. It affects our parents, siblings.\n\n\u2018I am a firm believer in the unity of Nigeria, the unity of Nigeria founded on justice, equity and then founded on true federalism. And we can achieve this by every segment of this society seeing ourselves as equals.\n\n\u2018The agitation that we have had, agitation for secession, for all sorts of things is because some sections of the country feel marginalised.\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the dialogue \u2013 \u201cDemocracy, Insecurity and Unity of Nigeria\u201d \u2013 the National Legal Adviser of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Barr Emmanuel Enoidem, who was represented on the occasion by Dr Tom Fredfish, made a case for an Igbo president, maintaining that the civil war was yet to be over until the Igbos are given the chance to produce the president of Nigeria.\n\nState Chairman of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) Akwa Ibom State Branch, Mr Franklyn Isong, who set the tone for the dialogue said the essence of drawing participants across political, religious and ethnic lines was to demonstrate the need for a bipartisan approach to tackling Nigeria\u2019s common enemies, economic challenges and insecurity.",

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nFor Titi Adeoye, acting is her second nature. She can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional.\n\nIn this interview, she narrated her journey into the movie industry, her heartbreak experience and greatest fear. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us about yourself and how you came into acting?\n\nI am Titilayomi Adeoye. I hail from the city of Ibadan. I studied Mass Communication at the Polytechnic, Ibadan and after my Industrial Training at Ogun State Television (OGTV); I proceeded for my HND also in Mass Communication. For me, acting is a natural talent from God, it is my second nature and I can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional. I joined Mr. Latin Theater Group in 2007. Mr. Latin gave me the opportunity to act as an agent in the movie titled, Baba Eleran in London. It was a big deal for me at that time.\n\nHow many movies have you featured in till date?\n\nSincerely, I have lost count.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest challenge in the movie industry?\n\nFor me, the only challenge is lack of opportunities to prove my abilities. But as I persevered and turned up at locations on time, each role assigned to me was done perfectly; confidence in me built up and that is how I get other opportunities to showcase my God-given talent.\n\nHave you produced any movie of your own?\n\nYes. I have produced over 10 home movies both in English and Yoruba. I am the producer of Pero, Scuffle, So Far So Close, Okanran, Tewe Tegbo, Eje, Ahon Mi, Omo Mala, Mojere, Ojo Ife Bere and many more.\n\nWhat part of your body do you consider your selling point?\n\nMy pointed nose and boobs.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s because I get compliments a lot about them from people.\n\nWhat has fame stolen from you?\n\nI am still myself. I promised myself not to let anything take who I am away from me.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about Titilayomi?\n\nComing out of my shell gradually to do something different.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do for a living?\n\nAside acting, I\u2019m also a realtor. I sell properties\u2026.\n\nAre you in any relationship at the moment?\n\nI would rather not say anything about that. I want to keep my private life private.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest fear in life? My greatest fear is failure. So many people look up to me that I can\u2019t afford to let them down.\n\nDo you believe in scandal for fame?\n\nNo. I guide against scandal in all parts. I don\u2019t need to be involved in scandal before I become popular. I love to keep my nose clean always.\n\nWhat\u2019s the highest thing you\u2019ve ever done for your man?\n\nI got him a job, fed him and even clothed him, but the relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ignore the signs.\n\nWhat is your turn off in a man?\n\nLies and deceits. I can\u2019t stand a man who lies.\n\nCan you have sex on a first date?\n\nNo! Sex is a bond. I need to be connected to you before I can have sex with you.\n\nCan you recount the happiest day of your life?\n\nAnytime I witness the breaking of a new day is my happiest. I don\u203at joke with that great opportunity at all.",

          "title": "Dot-in-circle: Amechi lambasts Buhari",
          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa\n\nFirst Aviation Minister in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amechi has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari for describing Ndigbo as a dot-in-a- circle, condemning the wrong choice of words and lack of diplomacy on the part of Mr President.\n\nHe also talked about agitation for self-determination and revealed what he would have done, if he were in President Buhari\u2019s shoes. Chief Amechi who has just clocked 92 years looked at other national issues. Excerpt:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently called the Igbo a dot in circle. What is your reaction to that?\n\nBuhari\u2019s deep-rooted hatred for Ndigbo is not a new thing. Buhari\u2019s lack of diplomacy even in government and use of diplomatic language or the language that fits a president is well known in Nigeria because as at today, even though Buhari is not wearing a military uniform, he is still the same soldier who overthrew a Fulani-led government in 1983 because the constitution of the then National Party of Nigeria (NPN) said that the next president of the country will be an Igbo man and Buhari swore that an Igbo will never be a president of the country. So, his hatred for Ndigbo and everything Igbo is not a new thing to me. And then his poor choice of language as a president, a real president would have found better words to use than that expression that Ndigbo are a dot in a circle. That is a poor choice of words, very unpresidential. That is all I can say about it. Now, yes, he said that the Southeast, that Igbo do not have access to the sea. There are many countries of the world that have no access to the sea yet they function. I have said it personally that I believe in a bigger country, Nigeria that I fought for. I dedicated my entire youth to the struggle for independence of Nigeria, a big country. And up till today I don\u2019t believe that Nigeria should break. But if Nigeria breaks, Buhari is responsible for the breaking of the country. If this country disintegrates, Buhari should accept total responsibility for it because it is his actions and inactions that have brought the whole thing in Nigeria to the level we are now.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the President\u2019s plan to return grazing routes and open grazing even when the Southern governors have banned it?\n\nThis question of Fulanis and cattle herders and all that is a new language and it only came up in Buhari\u2019s regime. There have been governments in Nigeria. There were NCNC and AG in Nigeria as political parties. There have been military regimes in Nigeria. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle to the East, West and South to sell. Buhari is the only president who wants to equate Fulani economy and empire with his attempt to Fulanize Nigeria and to Islamize Nigeria. That is what is causing the whole trouble. That is for allowing the Fulanis to be armed and allowing his government, people inside his government to arm the herders and they come down here, they shoot people, they damage crops, they rape women, kidnap people and not one of them has been arraigned in any court of law even though those who are arrested and handed over to the police are released the following day. What kind of president is that? The younger elements who are agitating for separation, agitating for Biafra or even the Yoruba now apart from the South-south which is another question which will be dealt with later. Will the South-south talk, are they free to talk?\n\nLet\u2019s leave that. Those who are free to talk are talking. Now, the younger elements say instead of being slaves to Fulanis after coming out from British imperialism to Fulani Empire, the Igbo say we don\u2019t support that. My own case is that the younger elements who did not see how we ran the country before they were born, how there was equity and balance in the country grew up to see themselves marginalized in their own country, rendered poor in the midst of plenty in their own country, and they said no, the system has to be changed because we have never been slaves in our lifetime. Our history shows we have never been slaves, let us go. A human president, a president with human feelings would not have stopped them of that. All he has to do is to conduct a plebiscite and ask Igbo to come and vote whether really they should go based on what these younger elements are saying or remain. How is he (Buhari) sure, in any case that if a plebiscite is called the majority will say we will go. Igbo have so many investments in other parts of Nigeria and West Africa. Igbo abroad are more in population and richer than Igbo at home. And so, they would certainly want that spread to be. The only thing they want is freedom, give us equity and balance that is all they are asking for in the affairs of the country. Let us compete with others, but you cannot come and take our general wealth and deny us our fair share. That is what they are saying. So, the proper thing would have been let\u2019s go and do the plebiscites, if the majority says we will go, let them go in peace. If the majority says we will not go, no we are not going, then they will remain and negotiate and find out what is their anger, what is the problem and all that and then solve them. That is the way I should have handled it, if I were in the position of the president. If the man is the kind of man who would listen to advice, that is what I would have advised him to do. He doesn\u2019t take good advice and always being misled by the cabals around him. He is not free again. Have you seen a president who has never made a speech himself except occasionally when he reads what is written for him by his speech writers and they pass it on to him, which he revises a number of times and then come to read it. After reading it, have you ever seen him take any question from the press? You are a pressman find out.\n\nLet\u2019s return to grazing routes and open grazing.\n\nDespite the ban placed by the Southern Governors, Mr President insists that the ban will not hold.\n\nWhat is your take on that?\n\nThe president has no such power even under the military constitution we are operating in Nigeria. He has no power to decide on land matters in the states. The states have the powers to decide on what to do with land in the individual states not the Federal Government. He cannot implement it, he cannot exercise it, although as a dictator, he can send soldiers to go and show force and all that. But the question is, it is all the same illegality that is going on otherwise he has no powers at all to do that. The presidency has nothing to say about this is a grazing ground, this is not a grazing ground, no. Only states governments have that right.\n\nWhat was the relationship like with nomadic Fulani herders in your days and at what point did we get it wrong?\n\nIn my days, I belonged to a political party that did not discriminate. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle. Those who lived permanently bought the cattle and the cattle were escorted on the roads. There were no so many trailers in our days. They were taking them along the road, but they were not allowed into farms. There was discipline then. Allowing them into farms is to provoke crisis to kill the people and that is what they are doing now. And that is what they continue to do. So, in our own time they mixed up well with our people. There was peace and harmony. One of the Fulanis, Alhaji Umaro was elected a member of Eastern House of Chiefs. Another young Fulani man was made the Mayor of Enugu, a Fulani man from Sokoto. He was elected two terms as a Mayor of Enugu because he was a President of Enugu youth branch of NCNC which I was serving as Secretary General. So, they were just part of us. They had absolute freedom and we were all living in peace and harmony. Nobody disturbed them. They were not particularly educated, but if we found any of them showing interest in education, we encouraged them to embrace education. The point we got it wrong is at the point of Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria. That was when the whole thing started. It didn\u2019t start in Shagari\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time. It started with President Buhari because of his other ambition of colonizing Nigeria, that Nigeria is a property bequeathed to them by Uthman Dan Fodio. That is the point we got it wrong.\n\nAnambra governorship election will come up on November 6 as scheduled by the INEC. What are your expectations, advice to political parties and Anambra people?\n\nThe individual political parties are doing their game. Some of the aspirants have come to me to inform me they are interested in the election. They asked for my prayer and I prayed that God may make the best among them to lead Anambra for the next four or eight years. It won\u2019t be said that the present government we have is any of the best. That thing there is a one-man show. So, he is going out next year, let him go out. Whosoever wins, let him know that Anambra State has wise men. Anambra has great names and great men in Nigeria. Let him realize that Anambra is full of hard-working men and women. And let him know that Anambra State is a state where people know their rights and are not prepared to shy away from them and then they should stop stealing from government. My doubt about free and fair election is on the interference of Abuja, otherwise if it is a question of voting I have no doubt that there will be free voting. But then manipulating the result is what I don\u2019t know because the constitution is such now that the military in their desire to promote military government in Nigeria concentrated all powers in Abuja. So, Abuja can still interfere, but I do hope they will not. I have not heard that the IPOB said there will be no election. If the election is going to be disturbed it will come from the Federal Government in order to create the atmosphere for a state of emergency in Anambra State. The Federal Government through their secret service, through their Gestapo could or may do it in such a way that it will be said based on this we can declare state of emergency and so forth. So, voters and politicians should be weary of that. They should not give them the chance. I advise Anambra people to do a peaceful election.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nHussaini Salisu is a Fulani rice farmer as well as a herder. He holds the traditional title of Dallatun Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nSalisu is currently the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Livestock Breeders Association of Nigeria (LIBAN), Kaduna State chapter.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he said that Nigerian politicians should stop saying that foreign Fulani are behind kidnapping and banditry in the country, warning that such remarks may provoke Fulani in neighbouring countries to launch attacks on Nigeria.\n\nSalisu also spoke on other national issues. Excerpts:\n\nBy way of introduction, are you a herdsman?\n\nI am the Dallatun of Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. I am a rice farmer. My parents live in the bush. We farm and rear cattle. We have farmers and cattle rearers whose occupations are being threatened by insecurity, particularly kidnapping and banditry. And the only way out of this insecurity is for the government to be realistic and non-partial in ensuring that peace is restored. Fulani people have been threatened by insecurity and their cows rustled over the years. Now, the government is trying to protect the farmers so that they can work on their farms without fear of being kidnapped. But nobody is talking about protecting the Fulani herdsmen who are rearing cows. They need to be protected too. We Fulani have been cheated, myself in particular, all my cows have been rustled, and I cannot also go to the farm. And somebody will say there will be peace?. I know many people will say Fulani are the bandits, kidnappers, this is how they have been frustrated. If you continue to talk about Fulani this way, they will not have peace and if they don\u2019t have peace, you cannot have peace yourself.\n\nWhat is the implication of farmers not going to the farms because of insecurity?\n\nFood scarcity will continue because the government says it will not import food, and now insecurity does not allow farmers to go to the farms to work. And the little farm products are being bought off by urban traders who travel to the village in search of food. So, urban dwellers rely on rural communities for food. The rural farmers and herders were living peacefully before now until city dwellers brought calamity to them by way of divide and rule in order to buy off their goods at cheaper rates. My parents were the pioneer owners of grazing reserves in Kachia, Kaduna State. My parents sponsored me to school from proceeds realised from the sales of thier cattle. Up till today my parents are in the bush rearing their cattle. But their 5,000 cattle have been reduced to 1,000 now as a result of rustling by criminal elements.\n\nWhat exactly are the causes of farmers/herders clashes in Nigeria?\n\nWhat used to cause farmers/herders clash was due to laying of claims to ownership of land because after the herders have penetrated thick forests and cleared the ways, the farmers would turn round to claim the areas. So, it resulted to clashes between them. But nowadays, there is no farmers/herders clashes. What we have now is communal clashes going on everywhere. Unfortunately, Fulani are the most hated people in Nigeria despite thier desires to live in peace with everybody. You cannot hate Fulani because we are hardworking people. We provide milk for the country, we provide meat for the country, and even the shoes you are wearing are made of cow\u2019s skins. Yet we are being frustrated.\n\nSome of our political leaders said most of the kidnappers and bandits are foreign Fulani. Do you agree?\n\nThose causing kidnapping and banditry are not foreign Fulani. If you say they are foreign Fulani, you are implicating Nigeria because Niger Republic or Burkina Faso and any other neighbouring countries will say you are accusing them unnecessarily. They will hate Nigeria, and you are implicating the country. The Fulani in Nigeria are the most populous in Northern Nigeria. So, if you say there are foreign Fulani in Nigeria, how do you confirm they are foreigners. It is very easy and simple to identify a Fulani man. But to us, any Fulani man you see with cattle, he is of benefit to Nigeria, he is not a foreigner. If we continue to call them foreigners, we are telling the rest of the world that they are criminals. We are implicating Nigeria. This is very unfortunate. Well, if you insist that they are foreigners, you have to identify them. After all Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa are foreigners, everybody comes from somewhere. The world started from somewhere. But if you keep on saying they are foreigners, you are encouraging them to come to Nigeria to join in the fight. When you keep on blackmailing them as foreigners they will come to Nigeria to help Fulani in Nigeria to fight.\n\nHow can kidnapping and banditry be brought to an end?\n\nThose who are into kidnapping are angry and they want to brutalise you because you have taken their products; they have nothing to rear, they have been frustrated, and they are taken to prisons because people believed that they are the bandits. Kidnapping and banditry are being tended towards the Fulani man. I can be innocently picked as bandit and be sent to prison because I am Fulani. Whatever is bad you label it against Fulani man. Fulani people have never committed crime, but you are now forcing them to commit crimes because their means of livelihood have been stolen. Their cows are being rustled. Their houses burnt, our people are killed.\n\nWhat happened to nomadic education put in place for the Fulani herders by previous government?\n\nNobody supported nomadic education to stand the test of time since it was established 35 years ago. Government and the general public did not support nomadic education. It is still at the primary level. It is not supposed to be at the infancy level after 35 years of its foundation. It should be well funded for the betterment of the society. If you are educated you cannot be engaging in criminal activities. The Fulani participated in the nomadic education, but the government did not motivate the school. Most of the classes were under the trees. How can you study under trees in this modern age of Nigeria\u2019s history. They are supposed to build functional schools for them.\n\nDon\u2019t you think dialogue is the way out of the present situation of insecurity between government and bandits?\n\nIs government ready to dialogue with anybody. The government is fighting those who are aggrieved. The government should bring them closer and negotiate with them. Look at what Sheik Ahmed Gumi did, he went to bandits\u2019 enclave, even while all of them were holding gun, trying to negotiate with them. This means that they can be negotiated with. You cannot go closer to any other tribe with gun, but you can go closer to a Fulani man with a gun and tell him to drop the gun, and he will drop it. Yet nobody did that with them. You want to have peace with this people and yet you refused to support Sheik Gumi who told Nigerians that these bandits are ready to make peace, but nobody supported Gumi. How can peace reign when you don\u2019t support somebody who is making the move.\n\nAre you saying that this government does not believe in negotiations with bandits?\n\nAsk yourself, you are a journalists, have you heard where the government is negotiating with them? There is nowhere that negotiation is going on. We have many political associations among the Fulani, nobody is negotiating with them. People who are making room for negotiation are being criticised, they are being called criminals too.\n\nFederal Government has recently resolved to reopen grazing routes across the country. What is your reaction to this?\n\nThat is what President Buhari said, not the government. And what did the southern governors say, they said no to open grazing. Every other Nigerians said no. And they want to have peace. You cannot have peace when you don\u2019t want me to survive. The government should be allowed to create grazing reserves. But animals need to move about because they are not like pigs or goats that you can tie them in one place. You cannot keep 1,000 cows in one place. They cannot survive without moving about. The government is not helping the Fulani if it keeps the cows in one place.\n\nThe argument here is that the era of cows moving about is gone in this modern age and time. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nThe whole system of Nigeria is not operated in a modern way. When the president wants to make speech he uses microphone; who created the microphone, it is the European. All the technology is from the European people, and yet you said you want to modernise grazing, what are you modernising. Then go ahead and modernise the economy so that everybody becomes rich. If you create grazing reserves for the Fulani, you can then arrest them if they go out of their ways to destroy anything. Take a look at the Kachia grazing reserves, we are living peacefully with the communities and our neighbours, there is no fight between us. They are on their own, we are on our own.\n\nFor some Nigerians who were born and grown in rural communities, they often tell peaceful and cordial relationship with nomadic Fulani. But all of a sudden there was mistrust and suspension between the Fulani and the people in the host communities. What went wrong?\n\nIt is the urban people that brought this disaffection to the Fulani and the local people in the rural communities. The urban people brought calamity to them. They have made them to fight one another.\n\nHow?\n\nLook at the farming system in the country, the farming system is collapsing, rearing is collapsing and the urban people want to survive from the farm produce of the rural dwellers. Now, the local people cannot farm again because of the calamity from the city. For instance, there is a town called Zangon-Kataf in southern Kaduna when the Fulani have been living with the natives for over 300 years until Hausa people from urban areas caused fight for them.\n\nHow did the urban Hausa caused the fight?\n\nThe Hausa urban are traders, they are not farmers. So they manipulate the native farmers, bought off their farm produce at a cheaper price. So also they manipulated the Fulani herders, picked up cows, the meat at cheaper rate. And before you know what was happening, crisis stepped in between the native and the Fulani.\n\nDo you see an end to this crisis?\n\nFrom the beginning of the world crisis was in place. It can never stop, but it can be minimised. However, bombs are being thrown at our cattle.\n\nIn the Southeast, some groups of Igbo are agitating for Biafra republic, and in the Southwest, similar groups are asking for Oduduwa republic. What is your reaction?\n\nWhen such republics are created there will never be peace in Nigeria because we will continue to fight with our former brothers. We will not want to see one another because we were once together as brothers and now you don\u2019t want to see me. They will even fight each other over land because there will not be enough land for them. And whenever they want to travel to any part of the world they must pass through Nigeria. But if they want to separate, let them go. We the Fulani people will survive if the country breaks up because we are the most populous in the North. We are the pioneer rulers of northern Nigeria. All the northern rulers are Fulani from inception.\n\nWhy are you addressed as Hausa/Fulani?\n\nWell, if they want to benefit from us, they address us Hausa/Fulani. We are Fulani, so you cannot call us Igbo/Fulani. If Hausa want to benefit from us they hide under our name. If it is a wrong thing, they say they are Hausa. If it is a right thing, they will say they are part of the Fulani. Once you are a Muslim from Niger Republic and enter Nigeria you become an Hausa man. Even as a Nigerian once you are a Muslim people tend to call you Hausa.",

          "title": "Bawa: EFCC Won\u2019t Hand over Cases of Interest to any State",
          "text": "\u2022Says commission as a creation of N\u2019Assembly supersedes states\u2019 establishments\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

So some economists say wait until you gather the money, that\u2019s bad economics,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWhile pointing out that many developed countries created super economies through borrowing, Fashola said that the recent loans obtained by the Federal Government would not mortgage the future of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe came from a background of colonialism where we were told that if you go borrowing, you go sorrowing, so, my parents and their generation told us never to borrow.\n\n\u201cBut while we were not borrowing, those who laid the rules started borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe largest debtors in the world today are from the West. But with borrowing they have created super economies, built massive train terminals, massive airports, schools and hospitals.\n\n\u201cAnd you know what is happening, we go to use them and they charge us, so who is paying?\n\n\u201cI have heard people say they are mortgaging the future of people, as we are holding this meeting, one new baby has arrived, if you don\u2019t prepare for him you make that future bleak.\n\n\u201cAs at the time we were building Lekki Bridge in Lagos, it was N29 billion, the child that was born then in 2010 is going to be 11 this year.\n\n\u201cIf his mother carrying his pregnancy had crossed that bridge at any time, he used that bridge before he was born and we had secured that asset for him before he arrived.\n\n\u201cIf we wait until he is about 30 to build that bridge, we can\u2019t buy it at N29 billion anymore.\n\n\u201cSo, if he contributes to paying it so be it because he started using it before he even arrived.\n\n\u201cSo, those who said don\u2019t borrow have changed their minds, they have set parameters of debt to GDP and within those parameters you play very well.\n\n\u201cAnd those who say so now, where were they in 2005 or 2006 when the government paid out $12 billion in cash to go and buy a tent when the house is flooding, who does that?\n\n\u201cThey took $12 billion in cash to go and write off debts that had been classified.\n\n\u201cThe roads were bad then, the rail was not built, airports needed expansion, Lagos-Ibadan (Expressway) needed to be built.\n\n\u201cBut since the aftermath of going to write off that debt we started borrowing again, so this administration did inherit all the debt.\n\n\u201cThere is a sector of our economy called the financial services sector, if all of us put money in a bank and nobody is borrowing, that bank is going to fold up.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have anybody in any venture capital, finance house, mortgage bank, it is because the government is borrowing that they can pay their salary.\n\n\u201cBorrowing is not a sin, it is part of the essence of keeping the economy growing and the armchair economists talking about public expenditure for example who have never run a government must be careful what they feed to the public,\u201d Fashola added.",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed. This is social media censorship brought back through the back door.\n\n\n\nLend your voice. Say no.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "title": "Nigeria is planning a new telecom licensing regime to rival developed countries",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "text": "Looking at where Nigeria is today, in terms of worsening insecurity, poverty, economic malaise, among other ills, many Nigerians are wondering what the state of the nation will look like in the next two years when the current administration is expected to come to an end.\n\nSome have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\n\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\n\nThe campaign afforded the then opposition the platform to blame the insecurity, economic woes, and every other problem in Nigeria on the failure of the then ruling party.\n\nBut as much as Nigerians quickly concluded that the messiah has come, they seemed to have never enjoyed any relief since the then opposition party came to power.\n\nFor many, the situation has degenerated from bad to worse in all fronts; from economy, social life, healthcare, and especially tackling insecurity, which many considered as reason the opposition won in 2015.\n\nInflation, unemployment rate, death rate, debt profile among other negative trends have more than quadrupled in the last six years of this administration and the remaining two years may likely make no difference.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer Boko Haram and North East. Now bandits, kidnapers, and herdsmen have taken the war to all parts of the country. There are killings every day and the government, which promised to tackle insecurity keeps doing little or nothing to tackle it,\u201d Yohanna Bulus, a lawyer and an aggrieved indigene of Borno State, decried.\n\n\u201cHow can Boko Haram hoist its flag in Nigeria and nothing is happening, government negotiates ransom with bandits and kidnapers take a whole school or town hostage without challenge. Nigeria is in a war situation now,\u201d Bulus observed.\n\nFor the Lagos-based maritime lawyer, the country is fast drifting apart and the principals and political actors are not keen on saving the situation because it is going according to their long-hatched plans.\n\n\u201cIf government wants to calm the situation and restore peace across the country, it will do it. But it does not want for obvious reasons; instead, it is threatening to roll out tanks in some parts of the country. You heard what they reeled out as achievements since gaining power; in sincerity, have there been achievements in a country where government is witnessing ethnic cleansing and wanton killings every day and keep silent? For me, safeguarding the lives of the citizens is far better achievement, which this administration has failed to do\u201d, Terhumba Tor, a senior lecturer at a federal university said.\n\nFor him, the principles of democracy and ideals of civil living are not upheld by the present administration and Nigerians are not expecting any positive change in the remaking two years of the present administration.\n\nOkwui Duruike, director, Centre for African Leadership Ideals, an Abuja-based African economy and politics research outfit, which has relocated to Cotonou in Benin Republic, noted that Nigerians should not expect miracle in the remaining two years of this administration as the country has been falling in development, human right and democracy indices in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted several researches on development, good governance and security in collaboration with international agencies across 30 African countries. Nigeria is among the worst in Africa, while Ghana, Seychelles and Gaborone are leading across many fronts. The Nigerian case is lack of will power by government to tackle insecurity, enforce necessary actions, restore peace, woo back investors and boost the economy. Stability of a country and economic development go hand in hand but that will not happen in the remaining two years,\u201d Duruike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn one of our reports on the worsening insecurity, we advised one of our foreign partners to inform the Nigerian government that all they needed was sincerity of purpose, boosting morale of its security operatives, fishing out sabotage, working with locals and collaboration with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nConsidering the huge damage done across the country due to the inaction of government, Tor thinks that two years will not be enough to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want to start, or what are you going to promise that has never been promised in the past. I don\u2019t expect any relief in the remaining two years of this administration because the thousands killed will not come back, houses burnt, farms destroyed and hopes dashed cannot be restored. I expect the worst in two years,\u201d Tor said.\n\nFor Bulus, the change we desire cannot come now or within the remaining two years because the recent actions of this administration point to a people that are running against time.\n\n\u201cThis is six years after taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who was regarded by many as a weakling. One former governor of Lagos State even said during campaign that a serious government will fix electricity issue in one year. So, they have been there for six years now and the trouble is quadrupling, so where is their magic wand?\u201d Bulus asked.\n\nOn his part, Ademola Fadahunsi, a political analyst, noted that though South West is clamoring to take over from President Buhari in 2023, the damage done so far is huge and will take almost the whole tenure of an incoming president to restore.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t value human lives again. The killing is much, the country is soaked in blood and no matter how much infrastructure you put in place, you need living humans, peaceful country and stability for such infrastructure to be meaningful. They flagged off Lagos-Ibadan rail, but Abuja-Kaduna rail is besieged by bandits. Why not tackle insecurity first before investment that is already threatened by current realities in the country?\u201d Fadahunsi said.\n\nHowever, observers note that insecurity is the biggest issue in the country today and that every effort of this administration should be channeled to address it. Yet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fool Nigerians by promising them a quick fix of insecurity in two years when since Jonathan\u2019s tenure, the country has been spending on security without result. We have witnessed change of security chiefs and increased budgets on security, yet no result. It will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Shamdam Plateau State-born retiree and now poultry farmer, said the fight against insecurity does not require huge spending on heavy armament, but will power and sincerity on the part of government, better treatment for soldiers, welfare for families of dead soldiers, empowerment of locals and collaboration with foreign countries to win.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to rhetoric that Boko Haram and bandits carry more sophisticated weapons. Can\u2019t such weapons be bought by Nigeria? All we need is sincerity of government to fight these terrorists, military to fight sabotage in its midst, locals to help with useful information and foreign partners to be given required information and free hand to work,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way the remaining two years of this administration will make a difference, but he does not see them toeing the solution line.\n\nTunde Daramola, a politician, is not optimistic about a turnaround in the next two years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe ship of the state has been grounded by the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari. The first responsibility of a reasonable government is the security of lives and property. Presently, no Nigerian is safe; people are scared to go out and work or even travel. This APC- led government is a failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners. No foreigner would come into Nigeria and invest with the level of insecurity today.\n\n\u201cNobody is happy and Nigerians are disappointed. It is a shame. I think the situation will get worse before 2023, or is it not getting even worse? Is the sign not there?\u201d\n\nBe believes that \u201cThis government appears overwhelmed with the situation; even the President confirmed it in the interview. I think these terrorists have some form of support, or how would you explain the situation now in the North where terrorists write letters to a community and come the same day to carry out an operation without any form of resistance?\n\n\u201cNigerians want this government to end today, not even tomorrow or 2023. Except for divine intervention, I don\u2019t see the situation improving. On the way forward, I am of the view that the President should urgently seek foreign help and intervention since he has admitted that the situation has overwhelmed him.\u201d\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a political analyst, said there was nothing more to expect from Buhari\u2019s remaining two years than what Nigerians have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government has lost touch with the people and they are even sinking deeper with their attempt to stifle media and social media. It is only when a government feels terribly defeated due to bad governance that they tend to clamp down on media and other forms of communication used by citizens to express their displeasure,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe level of insecurity is getting worse by the day, as you can see; another set of students has just been kidnapped in the Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome that people are now hired to welcome or protest in favour of Buhari; a truly performing government will not hire people; this goes to show that Buhari is not popular among Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is left for the government to review its actions and activities or continue to allow citizens to suffer, first time ever where Nigerians now buy yam pieces due to food inflation and increased poverty rate,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Is Nigerian Senate playing politics with PIB, Electoral Act and Constitutional Amendment?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the 9th Senate had a special session to celebrate its anniversary. The occasion afforded the senators the opportunity to sing their praises and what they said they have been able to achieve individually and collectively within the last two years.\n\nDespite being seen as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 Senate, one acclaimed major achievement of the 9th Senate was the interventions in restoration of the national annual budget to the January-December cycle.\n\nAnalysts have said the measure has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in the economy.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also mentioned the passage of the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP D3 LFN 2004 (Amendment Bill, 2009). The senators passed the important law to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of revenue from its crude oil.\n\nFor ease of doing business, the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law) (SB.140), which amended seven existing tax laws and Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20 LFN 2004 (Repeal and Reenactment) Bill 2019 (SB.270) were also passed by the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the current Senate headed by Ahmad Lawan has not gained the confidence of majority of Nigerians, who have continued to criticise the upper chamber and indeed the National Assembly of always doing the bidding of the executive, thus ignoring proper oversight and legislation.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from the frosty relationship that played out between the executive and legislative in the 8th Senate, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to ensure that someone loyal to the president and the ruling party emerged as the President of the Senate. So, the emergence of Senator Ahmad Lawan from Yobe North Senatorial District and Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta Central Senatorial District as president and deputy Senate president, respectively, was largely seen as mission accomplished.\n\nThe usual bickering commonly displayed by both arms of government and the rejection of Mr. President\u2019s nominees in the 8th Senate led by Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki has since been buried. Two years in the life of the current Senate, the relationship between the executive and legislature has been cordial.\n\nUnlike the 9th Senate, the 8th Senate always did their due diligence and oversight before passing anything from the executive, be it a bill or confirmation of a nominee(s). For instance, one case that stood out and has continued to be applauded by Nigerians was the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was rejected by the lawmakers on two different occasions based on a security report against his nominee from the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nSimilarly, the $30 billion loan request of the president to the 8th Senate was also rejected to save the country from sinking deeper into indebtedness. In his letter, Buhari explained that the amount was Federal Government\u2019s 2016 to 2018 external borrowing plan meant to execute key infrastructural projects cutting across all sectors with special emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, water supply, growth and employment generation.\n\nBut the Senate Committee Chairman on Loan and Foreign Debt in the 8TH Senate, Shehu Sani, explained that they rejected the loan request from Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from \u201csinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that the lawmakers did not want the country to be re-colonised by creditor banks.\n\nUnfortunately, it is no longer the case under the current leadership as majority of the senators, especially in APC, are hitherto seen as willing tools in the hands of the President.\n\nAs a way of returning back the favour done to him,November 2019, expressedwillingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, ItseSagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.\n\nHe quickly backed up the statement by saying that \u201cany request that comes from Buhari is good for the nation and the Senate will take immediate action on them.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cI want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it did not come as a surprise when the President\u2019s $30bn loan request was approved by the Lawan-led Senate. Additionally, in April 2021, the Senate approved the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the Federal Government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings Buhari had, in May 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the Federal Government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nAgain, the Senate on June 1, 2021 referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan request to borrow N2.343 trillion from external source to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.\n\nBesides, on May 18, 2021, Buhari had sought the approval of the Senate to borrow a fresh N2.343 trillion ($6.18bn) external loan. The committee was subsequently mandated to look into the request of the President on Donor Fund Projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan and submit its report within two weeks.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the 9th Senate has not been able to pass the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) despite assurances of early passage.\n\nThe bill was passed into second reading in October 2020 and in January 2021, there was a public hearing on it where the President of the Senate said by May 2021, they would pass the bill. But sadly, that has not been the case. He has back-tracked to say that the PIB will now be passed by June 2021 as both committees in the upper and lower chambers are now writing the final report.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly was to pass the PIB in May, however, there was need to put in place a legislative framework to further encourage foreign investments and development in the industry.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I think they (Joint Committee of the two chambers of the National Assembly on PIB) are about to start writing the report, which they will lay before the two chambers of the National Assembly, probably by the middle of June.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a sad commentary that a bill of such nature, capable of entrenching transparency and accountability in the oil sector, has not been pass into law after about 20 years it was first. introduced.\n\nNonetheless, the Electoral Act Amendment bill is one bill Nigerians are calling the 9th Senate to also expedite action on in view of the 2023 general election. In fact, INEC, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), political parties, the media and other stakeholders have been voicing out, even protesting on the need to pass and sign the bill into law.\n\nAs violence and all manner of rigging have continued to blight the electoral process, the passage and signing of the bill into law now becomes imperative in view of the Anambra gubernatorial election coming up on November 6, 2021.\n\nLawan has again promised Nigerians that the Electoral Act Amendment bill and the Constitutional Amendment bill will the passed by mid July 2021 before going on recess.\n\nThe lawmakers are currently on a two-week break and will resume on June 22, 2021. Therefore, between June 22 and July 15, 2021 when they are expected to go on their summer break, the question is: can they pass these bills within 23 days?\n\nSpeaking on an interview session on Channels Television Sunrise Daily, Friday, June 18, 2021, AjibolaBashiru, Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, expressed the optimism that the PIB, Constitutional Amendment Bill and Electoral Act Bill would be passed before the legislators proceed on their summer break.\n\n\u201cI am particularly optimistic that we will meet the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 109 senators should bear in mind that history bacons on them at this critical time to always do the right thing by enacting and passing laws that would stand the text of time.\n\nIn their oversight function, they must carry out thorough screening and confirm only qualified nominees of Mr. President, and not all manner of persons sent to them just to please the Presidency.\n\nThey should serve Nigeria and Nigerians as their priority, not sycophantic allegiance to the President, to the detriment of the country.",

          "title": "NAHCON To Adopt Malaysian, Indonesian Hajj Models",
          "text": "Determined to overcome the likely consequence of the cancellation of the annual pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for two consecutive years, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has revealed plans to adopt the Malaysia and Indonesia system of Hajj operations to deal with the congestion.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chairman of the Hajj Commission, Alh Zilkrullah Kunle Hassan, disclosed this while speaking to Hajj correspondents in Abuja.\n\nHe said he was hoping that foreign nationals would be allowed to perform this year\u2019s pilgrimage after Muslims all over the world were given limited opportunity to perform lesser Hajj (Umrah) earlier in the year, but since it is not, the Commission is determined to overcome the challenges ahead.\n\n\u201cMuslims all over the world were given limited opportunities to perform lesser Hajj (Umrah) this year and were hopeful up to the last minute that Hajj would take place this year. But as people of faith, we recognise the fact that what Allah has meant for you nobody will change it. So, since it has happened we are committed to face the future with hope, trusting God that it will be the last time such will happen that our people would not be able to perform Hajj.\n\n\u201cSo, management would become necessary and I don\u2019t think this is something new. To be honest with you, I was discussing with my counterpart from Indonesia four days ago when we had a zoom meeting and in their own case, he said those that were to perform Hajj this year are people who have been on the queue for 20 years. In Malaysia, people queue for more than 20 years. Whether we like it or not, we would probably have to face the same consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you are familiar with going to Saudi Arabia for Hajj you would find out that pilgrims from these countries are usually old people because they were on the queue for many years. In fact, in Malaysia and Indonesia, some people are registered to perform Hajj from day of birth in order to make Hajj something they can do before their old age. A child given birth in Malaysia would be registered in the Hajj Saving Scheme of the country so that he or she can perform Hajj before he or she becomes too old. If that becomes our case, we will not be doing new things because we already have people who are doing so and our own would be just to tape from their idea and manage it better,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nWhile consoling intending Nigerian pilgrims across the country who had wish to be part of this year\u2019s pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia to accept the cancellation in good faith, Hassan said the Commission will engage the State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards and private tour operators to speak and enlighten the pilgrims, assuring them that their fund would be well secure.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to actually console many of our prospective pilgrims all over the country who had wished to be part of this journey this year. We are not alone in this, it is Muslims all over the world that are equally affected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are going to engage the leadership of the State Pilgrims Welfare Boards and tour operators to go back and speak with the pilgrims. We\u2019ll ensure that their funds are secure. Once that is done we all wait for next year and pray that it will take place,\u201d the NAHCON chairman added.\n\nhttps://leadership.ng/saudi-arabia-bars-foreign-pilgrims-from-hajj/",

          "text": "Determined to overcome the likely consequence of the cancellation of the annual pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for two consecutive years, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has revealed plans to adopt the Malaysia and Indonesia system of Hajj operations to deal with the congestion.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chairman of the Hajj Commission, Alh Zilkrullah Kunle Hassan, disclosed this while speaking to Hajj correspondents in Abuja.\n\nHe said he was hoping that foreign nationals would be allowed to perform this year\u2019s pilgrimage after Muslims all over the world were given limited opportunity to perform lesser Hajj (Umrah) earlier in the year, but since it is not, the Commission is determined to overcome the challenges ahead.\n\n\u201cMuslims all over the world were given limited opportunities to perform lesser Hajj (Umrah) this year and were hopeful up to the last minute that Hajj would take place this year. But as people of faith, we recognise the fact that what Allah has meant for you nobody will change it. So, since it has happened we are committed to face the future with hope, trusting God that it will be the last time such will happen that our people would not be able to perform Hajj.\n\n\u201cSo, management would become necessary and I don\u2019t think this is something new. To be honest with you, I was discussing with my counterpart from Indonesia four days ago when we had a zoom meeting and in their own case, he said those that were to perform Hajj this year are people who have been on the queue for 20 years. In Malaysia, people queue for more than 20 years. Whether we like it or not, we would probably have to face the same consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you are familiar with going to Saudi Arabia for Hajj you would find out that pilgrims from these countries are usually old people because they were on the queue for many years. In fact, in Malaysia and Indonesia, some people are registered to perform Hajj from day of birth in order to make Hajj something they can do before their old age. A child given birth in Malaysia would be registered in the Hajj Saving Scheme of the country so that he or she can perform Hajj before he or she becomes too old. If that becomes our case, we will not be doing new things because we already have people who are doing so and our own would be just to tape from their idea and manage it better,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nWhile consoling intending Nigerian pilgrims across the country who had wish to be part of this year\u2019s pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia to accept the cancellation in good faith, Hassan said the Commission will engage the State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards and private tour operators to speak and enlighten the pilgrims, assuring them that their fund would be well secure.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to actually console many of our prospective pilgrims all over the country who had wished to be part of this journey this year. We are not alone in this, it is Muslims all over the world that are equally affected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are going to engage the leadership of the State Pilgrims Welfare Boards and tour operators to go back and speak with the pilgrims. We\u2019ll ensure that their funds are secure. Once that is done we all wait for next year and pray that it will take place,\u201d the NAHCON chairman added.\n\nhttps://leadership.ng/saudi-arabia-bars-foreign-pilgrims-from-hajj/",

          "text": "Popular Nigerian singer Joel Amadi, popularly known as Joe El, has revealed that he still battles with the trauma almost a year after the death of his father.\n\nIn an interview with Sunday Scoop, he said, \u201cOne of the traumas I still go through is that anytime any of my sisters or mum calls me, the first thing that pops up in my head is \u2018Hope these people are safe\u2019? That fear just comes.\n\n\u201cOn the day that incident happened, it was my younger sister who called and when I answered the phone, she narrated everything to me. She told me how they hid under the bed, while gunshots were sounding everywhere.\n\n\u201cSince my dad\u2019s demise, anytime I sleep, even if it\u2019s a 30 minutes nap, I see myself in a dream battling with bandits or herdsmen.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2023: South East should produce the President \u2013 Shehu Sani\n\nNow, I have even become used to it because it hit me so hard. I am the only son and have to take care of three grown women (sisters and mum).\n\nAnytime I look around and see that my dad is not around, it makes me feel very miserable. But, prayers have been keeping me strong. Anytime I feel \u2018down\u2019, I talk to God and I beg Him to give me strength because I have to stay alive and strong for my mother and sisters.\u201d\n\nResponding to a comment regarding artistes who had faded out of limelight and were being referred to as up-and-coming, Joe El said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they are trying to encourage them that they can still \u2018blow\u2019 again or insulting them. I hear such comments directed at veterans who had made hits in the past. People say their times have passed.\n\n\u201cAlthough they may not be currently making waves like they used to, it does not mean we should disrespect their previous works. Many legends in the industry can\u2019t compete with the budding artistes now but saying they are up-and-coming is not a way to show appreciation for the works they had done in the past.\u201d",

Operatives in the area are currently on the trail of suspects at large.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Kastina-Ala town are advised to remain calm and avail every useful information about the bandits to the police.\u201d\n\n15 bandits killed in Niger\n\nIn a related development, about 15 armed bandits were killed in a gun duel with troops Saturday in Anguwan Mallam, Kontagora, Niger state.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the exchange of fire occurred at about 4.00pm when the troops on patrol sighted the criminals at the location.\n\nA local source told Blueprint that the arrival of the troops was what saved the 70-member gang from dealing a deadly attack on the residents.\n\nWith the gallant soldiers exhibiting superior firepower, the bandits reportedly fled into the bush.\n\nHowever, the police authority was yet to comment on the development as at the time of this report.\n\nNAF shells terrorists\n\nAlso in yet another victory over the criminal elements, the fighter aircraft of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Sunday eliminated scores of ISWAP-Boko Haram terrorists, including their commanders in Lamboa in Kaga local government area of Borno state.\n\nPRNigeria gathered that the multiple airstrikes conducted by a mix of aircraft including Alpha-Jets, L-39 and MI-35 helicopters, might have also killed the notorious ISWAP Logistic Commander, Modu Sullum.\n\nSullum was allegedly responsible for the destruction of power transmission towers at Malanari along Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway and attacks on travellers in Auno and Jakana axis.\n\nThe insurgents, in a convoy of eight gun trucks had invaded Lamboa, preparatory to launching a gruesome attack in Mainok axis in the state.\n\nBut the terrorists were swiftly engaged by ground and air troops, who foiled their missions after the NAF reconnaissance platform had earlier hovered over the location before the airstrikes.\n\nIt was gathered that over a dozen ISWAP-Boko Haram fighters were killed by bombardments of the military fighter aircraft.\n\nWhen contacted, air force spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the success of the military airstrikes.\n\nHe told PRNigeria that \u201cYes, it was a very successful operation. Of the eight terrorist gun trucks sighted by our surveillance team, the aircraft successfully took out six of the trucks, including an unconfirmed number of terrorists that were eliminated.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the ground troops of the Nigerian Army and our air elements are mopping up the area and assessing the situation.\n\n\u201cAs we have said before, there is no hiding place for these terrorists especially with the renewed vigour, synergy and jointness being exhibited by all members of the Armed forces in the North-East theatre of Operation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PRNigeria gathered that other military offensives were simultaneously taken place in other axes including Magumeri with the resumption of office of the New Theatre Commander Operation Hadi Kai, Major-General Chris Musa.",

          "text": "Kebbi state government has indefinitely shut down seven schools in the wake of the armed attack of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri Thursday, the Nigerian Union of Teachers has confirmed.\n\nThe schools are located on the frontlines of the areas prone to bandit attacks.\n\nIn the latest attack, students and three teachers were abducted from the school.\n\nA policeman was killed in the attack and a student sustained gunshot wounds.\n\nChairman of NUT in Kebbi, Isah Arzika told the News Agency of Nigeria that the government had directed all school principals to close any school which they believed were not safe, adding that police and vigilantes had also been deployed to the schools for monitoring and protection.\n\n\u201cOn these proactive measures, as you all know, we are part of the system. Because Principals are teachers, all the Directors at the Board are also teachers. It is the decision that we all took that is affecting us.\n\n\u201cGovernment has given us an order and option to take any necessary action as far as our schools are concerned. That we can close those schools which we think are not safe and prone to attacks in the areas close to the forest.\u201d\n\nThe NUT chairman assured that they had already closed those frontline schools, describing such a move as a proactive measure to guard against a recurrence of the incident similar to that of FGC Yauri.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about only boarding schools, any school that is on the frontline and it is not safe, we would just ask the students to pack and go home, pending the time the situation normalises.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore now, the state government had recruited large number of vigilante members to look over our schools and we are very much satisfied with what the government has done.\n\n\u201cSome of these schools that I am talking about have policemen attached to them, honestly, we are satisfied with government actions\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the FGC Yauri abductions, the NUT chairman appealed to parents to remain calm and continue praying to God Almighty for the restoration of peace in the area and the country at large, while supporting the security agencies with vital information that would enable the rescue of the abducted persons unhurt.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the security agencies have swung into action on the bandits, we have not made fresh contact with the parents and relatives of the students and teachers still in their captivity.\n\n\u201cWhen we made our first contact two days ago, precisely on Thursday, they did not demand any ransom, instead, they told the parents and relatives that they only wanted to establish contact with them and inform them that their children are with them.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you, two of our teachers have regained their freedom. Already, seven schools on the frontline in that area have been closed and more will be closed, if we realise the situation is not safe for the teachers and students.\n\nResponding to a question on how the bandits made their contact with the parents, Arzika explained that they collected the contacts of parents and teachers from the abductees and thereafter made calls to tell them that their children and people were with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was communication from them, but none of them asked for a kobo, they only said they wanted to establish contact that the abductees are in their custody.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the security agencies swung on them and since then there was no contact again\u201d.\n\nNAN\n\n",

          "title": "FGC Yauri abduction: Why Kebbi chose not to negotiate with bandits",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nFour days after the abduction of some unspecified number of students of Federal Government College (FGC), Birnin Yauri, Kebbi state, the state government has refused to negotiate with the bandits, a decision that appears a departure from the past.\n\nIn what is fast becoming a norm as Nigeria battles its multifarious security challenges, government and private citizens were always quick to commence quick process of negotiating with the victims to possibly save them from their captors.\n\nBut taking a different path, Blueprint gathered that the state government was encouraged by the citizens not to go into any form of negotiation with the kidnappers.\n\nTheir effort, it was gathered, led to the gunning down of 82 of the criminals and rescue of some of their captives.\n\nAs at the time of this report, about 11 of the abductees had been rescued. While seven were rescued Friday, 4 regained their freedom Sunday courtesy of the troops, other security agencies and vigilantes.\n\nNegotiation as no option\n\nOn why government ruled out negotiation with the bandits, a top government source said, the immediate response of Governor Atiku Bagudu and that of security agencies was what really thrilled the populace.\n\n\u201cFor once, we saw something different since this madness by bandits hit our state. For the record, you and I know that Kebbi was about the most peaceful of the whole of North-west states. But suddenly they chose to disrupt that peace like late last year and early this year.\n\n\u201cIt is even worse when the hoodlums came on bikes to abduct the students last Thursday. I must tell you that the sharp response by the security agents and that from the governor was what really inspired some level of confidence in the residents who continued to insist that government must not negotiate with the criminal elements.\n\n\u201cI think this is the way to go. Our security agents deserve a lot of commendation in the handling of this.\n\n\u201cIs it not even encouraging that the bandits were mauled and hunted down by our gallant troops, the police and the vigilante group in the state? This is just the way to go. In shaa Allah (by God\u2019s grace), banditry and other forms of criminality will soon come to an end in our dear nation. We have tolerated enough this trash. This is just the way to go to putting an end to the pampering of these hoodlums who have turned kidnapping and inflicting pains on fellow citizens to business,\u201d said the source Sunday who spoke under anonymity.\n\nAlso speaking, a resident of Yauri who simply gave his name as Muhammadu said, \u201cWe are in support of government\u2019s action because it did everything to forestall this by ensuring security agents were stationed in that school.\n\n\u201cGive it to them, the security agents are humans and not spirits, so they were overpowered. But the good thing is that they (security agents) didn\u2019t stop at that. A hot chase on the heels of the criminals is leaving no room for negotiation. Yes, government has demonstrated it\u2019s in charge and that is how it should be.\u201d\n\nThe position corroborates the various video clips on the social media showing the military dealing deadly blows on the bandits, following which some of their captives were rescued.\n\nAlthough the authenticity of the clips could not be verified as at the time of this report, a former council chairman told Blueprint under anonymity that \u201cthe bandits got the worst of their life when soldiers, police and vigilante group caught up with them at Mokuku in Sakaba local government area of the state.\u201d\n\nIt was independently gathered that not less than 82 of the hoodlums were gunned down by the security agents who overpowered the kidnappers in a gun duel over the weekend, even as they continued in the hot chase of the bandits.\n\nBagudu speaks\n\nInspired by the bravery demonstrated by the security agents and the level of cooperation from the locals, Governor Bagudu assured that efforts were being intensified by the state government to ensure the safe rescue of the abductees.\n\nThe governor spoke while addressing a mammoth crowd of vigilante groups who paid him a sympathy visit at the Government House Birnin Kebbi over the weekend.\n\nBagudu said he owed people of the state a responsibility by ensuring all the kidnapped persons returned safe to their families.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not voted into power to sit at the Government House and enjoy all the luxury of power and watch my people been maimed and killed, likewise every other elective office holder should and must be prepared to work assiduously towards safeguarding the lives and property of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe visibly angry governor further said: \u201cI am ready to make sacrifices physically to confront these men of the underworld. Enough is enough of this nonsense and heartless acts in the name of banditry.\u201d\n\nHe commended the efforts of the Nigerian Army, Police and vigilante groups for their active involvement in the rescue operation leading to the release of some students and their teachers.\n\nVigilante leader assures\n\nSpeaking earlier, leader of the state chapter of the vigilantes, Alhaji Sani Zauro Hukuma hailed the governor for his timely response that ensured the ongoing joint rescue operation to comb the forest and rescue some students.\n\nHe assured that members of his group were always ready to lend their support in ridding the state of bandits and related criminals.\n\nAlso speaking to journalists, the governor\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yahaya Sarki said the governor had received much commendations from the people of Kebbi for his prompt action.\n\n\u201cUpon receiving the news of the unfortunate abduction while in Abuja on official engagement, the governor had to cut it short and went straight to Birnin Yauri. The state government would do everything humanly possible to bring back these children and the staff back safely,\u201d he also assured.\n\n\u201cSince this unfortunate incident occurred, all hands have been on deck to ensure our children and the staff are rescued alive, hale and hearty,\u201d he said\n\nTroops rescue 3 others\n\nMeanwhile, troops of Operation Hadarin Daji, have rescued three more students of the Federal Government College Birnin Yawuri and one of the teachers.\n\nThe abductees were rescued at Makuku during search and rescue operations with one of the bandits killed.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Director Army Public Relations Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, more troops had been deployed to the forests.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTroops of the Nigerian Army operating under the auspices of Operation HADARIN DAJI supported by Nigerian Air Force component have rescued more abductees of the FGC Birnin Yawuri.\n\n\u201cOne teacher and three students were rescued yesterday at Makuku, in the ongoing search and rescue operations. The troops also killed one bandit and recovered nine motorcycles and four handsets from the fleeing bandits.\n\n\u201cAdditional troops have also been deployed to dominate the forest and deny the bandits freedom of action.\n\n\u201cRecall that two teachers and five students were earlier on Friday 18 June 2021 rescued by the gallant troops in a coordinated fire fight with the kidnappers.\u201d\n\n15 Tegina abductees escape\n\nSimilarly, some 15 persons abducted alongside Tanko Salihu Islamiyya students in Tegina, Niger state have escaped from their captives.\n\nWhile some of the abductees arrived the town Saturday night, others returned Sunday morning and afternoon and were already in various health facilities for adequate medical attention.\n\nIn their separate accounts, the captives said they regained their freedom when the guards keeping watch over them slept off and felt into slumber.\n\nIt was gathered that after the abduction, the victims were separated from the kids whose(kids) whereabouts they wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nIt was further revealed that prior to their escape, the victims were locked down in Zamfara forests, following which government sent a reinforcement team to the forest to secure release of the other captives.\n\nIt was learnt those who escaped had been admitted in health facilities.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the captives were received a top official of Rafi local government council at Birnin Gwari.",

          "text": "Civil Society Organizations in Defence of Justice has expressed disappointment against the continued disobedience of court order by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC and the first generation bank.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, the Convener of the group, Comr. Sam Adah, called on the new Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa to flush out personnel who are fare being used by some bad elements to flout court orders, just as he stressed that the commission should rather be seen as one leading the fight against corruption which includes obeying the rule of law and not perverting justice.\n\nWhile citing the plight of some members of the Eleme Petrochemical Cooperative and Credit Society of INDORAMA Petrochemical Ltd , in Rivers State who he said have been seeking justice over issues regarding equity shares in the company, he also called for the immediate unfreezing of the cooperative\u2019s bank account in line with the orders of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cOn February 26, 2009, the federal government through the National Council on Privatization had approved the sale of 10% of its equity shares in Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd, Port Harcourt, Rivers State to the host community and interested staff of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd. The 10% equity shares was shared as 7.5% was allotted to the host community while the remaining 2.5% was allotted to the Staff of Indoroma Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cInterested Staff came together under Eleme petrochemical co-operatives in compliance to the federal government directive that a special purpose vehicle be formed where all members will belong to enable them buy the shares.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, 10 staffs who initially subscribed to the purchase of the 2.5 equity shares had their jobs terminated from the employment of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis led to the beginning of a legal battle as to whether the laid off staff can continue to enjoy the dividends since they were no longer staff in the company.\n\n\u201cWhen the shareholding became an issue the laid off staff approached the River State Ministry of Commerce and Industry to arbitrate between it and the cooperative, the Ministry gave an Arbitral Award in favour of the laid off staff and consequently, the exited staffs of the co-operative approached the Federal High Court to enforce the arbitral award and as required by law it was granted and the award became a judgment of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe judgement affirmed the laid off staffs as the authentic owners of the shares. It is of important to note that this judgement has not been appealed to this day.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O.Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting, detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of Indorama Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O .Taiwo of the Federal high court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting ,detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of INDORAMA Petrochemicals ltd.\n\n\u201cWe urge the new Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa to revisit the case and make sure that certain elements in the agency promoting abuse of court orders be arrested and dealt with accordingly.\u201d\n\nHe called on the EFCC rise to its mandate and responsibility and desist from been used by influencial and powerful Nigerians to intimidate poor Nigerians.\n\nOther demands includes that First Bank of Nigeria, without further delay should honour the order of the court and grant access to the funds in its custody.\n\n\u201cFirst Bank must realize that this very act has cost many loss to the members of the Co-operative especially the diseased ones, whose widows only livelihood depends on the funds in their custody.\n\n\u201cIf the impunity continues we will have no option than to commence legal Action against First Bank.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, had said that ongoing cases are not immediately made available to his office.",

This year, candidates were able to locate their centres on time, the supervisors also came on time to take biometric of the candidates, in fact, the whole process is smooth and hitch-free.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Mrs. Grace Godwin confirmed that the process of this year\u2019s UTME was smooth, saying that JAMB has recorded massive improvement in conducting online examination.\n\n\u201d Our children did not complain much about the use of computer or any delay during the exam. There was no case of malpractice or system failure.To me, this is a great feet that JAMB has achieved so far.\n\nAlso, a proprietor and CBT centre owner of Ade- Ola Int\u2019l Schools, Mrs. Mercy Olaosegbe told our reporter that the JAMB examinations in her centre started successfully but experienced a hitch when the server went off.\n\n\u201d The examination was going on successfully, candidates came as early as 7 O\u2019 clock, had their thumb print, we started at the appropriate time, but along the line the server went off. This, actually caused a little delay, but thank God the technical officers were able to fix it as quickly as possible,\u201d said Olaosegbe.\n\nOn the parts of the candidates, especially those who had sat for UTME in the previous years, said there was no stress locating their centres , capturing their biometrics, and operating computer during the 2021 UTME.\n\nIn her own response, Ms Amu Bethel Chioma, one of the candidates said, the conduct was smooth except that questions encountered in the Chemistry were set outside the syllabus and were tough.\n\n\u201d There was no problem with the use of computer because it was the same computers we use for Mock exam that we still used but the only problem was the Chemistry, most things I read were not in the questions,\u201dshe said.\n\nAnother candidates, Odema Nfong from Spirited International School, said her problem was only Literature- in- English where most of the questions were set from the old syllabus.",

          "text": "Emirates Airlines will resume flights to Nigeria from June 23, five months after it banned outbound flights from Abuja and Lagos. This followed the withdrawal of the Rapid Antigen Test the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had insisted passengers from Nigeria travelling to Dubai must take four hours before boarding their flights.\n\nIn another development, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) confirmed it had fixed the airfield light at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, Runway 18R, to enable flights land in the night. Regional Terminal Manager in charge of MMIA, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, stated this on Saturday in an interview with THISDAY.\n\nThe UAE antigen test requirement was against Nigeria\u2019s policy that passengers travelling out of the country should conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 72 hours before their flight.\n\nBut on Saturday, UAE issued a statement conceding that Nigerian passengers that wished to travel to Dubai \u201cmust have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on Instagram by the Dubai media office also said passengers travelling from Nigeria should present a negative PCR test certificate with a QR Code from labs approved by the Nigerian government. It stated that all passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai, adding, \u201cTransit passengers should comply with entry protocol of final destination.\u201d\n\nThe media office said the new regulation was part of measures aimed at easing inbound travel restrictions by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management. The committee introduced new entry protocols for passengers effective June 23.\n\nBesides the new condition for Nigerian travellers, UAE has new regulations for passengers travelling from South Africa and India to Dubai.\n\nFor South Africa, the new rules stipulate that passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cPassengers must present a negative test result for a PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure; UAE citizens are exempted. All passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival at Dubai airport. Transit passengers should comply with entry protocols of final destination,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFor travellers from India, UAE said passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities and passengers must have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure, in addition to the other conditions given to Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nConfirming the withdrawal of the antigen test, Emirates Airlines issued a statement signed by its management, which said, \u201cEmirates welcomes the latest protocols and measures announced by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management to allow the safe resumption of passenger travel from South Africa, Nigeria and India to Dubai. We look forward to facilitating travel from these countries and supporting various travellers\u2019 categories.\n\n\u201cWe will resume carrying passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India in accordance with these protocols from 23rd June. We thank the Supreme Committee for their continuous efforts in monitoring the development of the situation and announcing the appropriate guidelines and protocols to protect the community and safeguard travel sector.\u201d\n\nReacting to the new development, President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, said UAE had done what the Nigerian government wanted. Akporiaye said the new development had shown that no country could rubbish Nigeria if it insisted on a position popular with its citizens.\n\nThe NANTA president said there would be a price to pay if a country stood its ground, regretting that Nigeria had often tended to shy away from the reality of that price.\n\nAkporiaye stated, \u201cSome of the prices include the fact that many Nigerian students studying overseas that were due to travel back found it very difficult doing so without Emirates flights from Nigeria. We travel agents also paid a huge price because if Emirates flights were operating, we would have made money; we wouldn\u2019t have been at the state we are now financially.\n\n\u201cWe give kudos to the federal government and travel agencies. We will now wait for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to lift the ban on Emirates.\u201d\n\nUAE had made the Rapid Antigen Test compulsory for Emirates Airlines, which was to start administering the test on Nigerian passengers from February 4, 2021.\n\nIn response, the federal government temporarily banned the Middle East carrier, insisting passengers travelling out of Nigeria are only required to have PCR test 72 hours before their flight. The government said it did not have the facilities for the antigen test demanded by Emirates.\n\nFollowing Nigeria\u2019s insistence, Emirates banned its outbound flights from Nigeria and later its in-bound flights, which it had operated for several weeks after the ban on outbound flights.\n\nMeanwhile, for over one week the centre lights at the MMIA runway were unserviceable, prompting the agency to issue Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and provide bar stopper light at each end of the runways to guide pilots to land after dusk.\n\nShin-Aba told THISDAY that the airfield lighting on the runway had been fixed and all airlines could now land their planes at the airport.\n\nHowever, insider sources at FAAN told THISDAY that a temporary measure was put in place to enable flights land, as the second runway, known as Runway 18L (domestic runway), had no airfield lighting for years since its rehabilitation in 2008.\n\nThe status of the runway lighting before it was fixed on Saturday might have prompted British Airways to divert its Lagos flight to Abuja on Friday, but other airlines landed their flights at the airport in Lagos.\n\nThe FAAN regional manager stated, \u201cThe runway lights had been bad since over a week, but FAAN issued NOTAM to notify airlines and pilots globally, so any airline coming to Nigeria knew the problem with the runway.\n\n\u201cBut FAAN installed bar stopper light at the two ends of the runway to guide pilots that wish to land at the runway in the night. This is a big challenge for us because it is not about getting the airport certified; it is about sustaining the standard achieved to earn the certification.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why BA diverted its flight to Abuja, but the airline was aware of the status of the airport even before it left London to Lagos.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze and Michael Olugbode",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has called on West African leaders to exert more pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country is not aborted.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was contained in his address on Saturday at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana.\n\nMali was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup in the country.\n\nBuhari, who spoke extensively on the Malian situation, said, \u201cAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people. In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions, which will positively impact our citizens.\n\n\u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily, will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want. Pressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is, unfortunately, under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as \u201cclearly under siege\u201d.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, Buhari cautioned them not to perpetrate acts that could destabilise and destroy their country.\n\n\u201cI urge our organisation to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d the president added.\n\nOn Libya, Buhari faulted the recent United Nations resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the security situation in the region, our organisation must note with serious concern the recent decision by the United Nations and its Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without, first, ensuring that they are disarmed and that neighbouring countries and the Sub-regions were engaged, to put in place modalities for containing or managing the movement of these fighters.\n\n\u201cWhile this action was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders on this critical decision has now created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region, which could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\u201d\n\nThe president said these regions faced a clear possibility of instability with the invasion of the fully armed foreign fighters.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe speech by the Nigerian president at the Summit also addressed other issues of concern in the organisation, including the on-going institutional reforms in ECOWAS. He declared Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reform process, saying he looks forward to an ECOWAS that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nBuhari commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms, as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have clearly realised that operating a bloated administration with the current global economic collapse occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic will be to the detriment of services to our people, which is not sustainable.

          "title": "Nigeria: Anti-graft Chair Bawa Says EFCC Won\u2019t Hand Over Cases to States",
          "text": "Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Three days after the violent kidnap of more than 80 students, a majority of them girls, and five teachers at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, in northwest Nigeria, federal troops late Saturday night were believed to have rescued the rest of the kidnapped victims.\n\nThe troops, THISDAY gathered, were able to rescue the students and their teachers after closing in on the bandits and killings scores of them, before the rest abandoned their hideouts, leaving the victims behind.\n\nSpeculation, however, became rife over the alleged rescue of the students and their teachers, even though details were still unclear as to how the troops ultimately pulled off the rescue operations.\n\nAlthough a day after the raid by the bandits, the military too had moved swiftly, rescuing five students and two teachers, while announcing that one of the students, a female, had died in the forest.\n\nNigerian army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu confirmed that a female student was found dead in the forest by troops tracking the kidnappers, adding that those who were rescued were freed after an exchange of fire in the early hours of Friday.\n\nWith support from the Nigerian Air Force, the troops also reportedly recovered about 800 stolen cattle from the grip of the bandits during the operation, the statement by Nwachukwu claimed.\n\nSo far, no official source could confirm the eventual rescue of the rest of the abducted students and their teachers at the time of filing this report, but a few other sources have confirmed the development, albeit without the requisite details.\n\nOne of the sources contacted early Sunday morning confirmed that the news of their alleged release had been swirling since late Saturday night, but that there was no concrete confirmation from any of the official sources as everyone seemed to have shut down.\n\n\u201cWe heard the news but no one has the details, much less seen any of the students. But the news has been circulating amongst certain class of people, who were confident that the students had been released,\u201d the source stated.\n\nBandits, on Thursday, kidnapped at least 80 students and five teachers from the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, killing a police officer in the process.\n\nA teacher from the school, Usman Aliyu, said the gunmen took more than 80 students, most of them girls.\n\n\u201cThey killed one of the (police officers), broke through the gate and went straight to the students\u2019 classes,\u201d the teacher reportedly told Reuters, a foreign news medium.\n\nKebbi State police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed that the gunmen killed one of their officers during an exchange and also shot a student, who had since been receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe Kebbi State Police Command further claimed that the vehicle used to convey the kidnapped students and teachers belonged to an unnamed High Court judge in the state.\n\nA resident, Atiku Aboki, who went to the school shortly after the gunfire stopped, said he saw a scene of panic and confusion as people searched for their children.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we saw students crying, teachers crying, everyone is sympathising with people,\u201d he also said to Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s kidnapping at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi, marked the third mass abduction from a school in Northwestern part of Nigeria in some weeks, with armed gangs carrying out the kidnappings for ransom.
