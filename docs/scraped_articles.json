As difficult as it is, it is achievable,\u201d Fauci noted.\n\nRecall that a report from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Scripps Research published online in European Pharmaceutical Review showed that a new vaccine against HIV has shown promise in Phase 1 trials, leading to the production of efficient antibodies in 97 percent of participants.\n\nThough there are ongoing researches to find a lasting cure for HIV, there is presently no licensed HIV vaccine in the market.\n\nThe first HIV vaccine trial opened in 1987 at the National Institutes of Health, Clinical Centre, USA, and its Phase 1 trial enrolled 138 healthy, HIV-negative volunteers.\n\nThis new vaccine, which is the product of collaboration between the Scripps Research Institute and non-profit IAVI, draws on a novel vaccination approach to help patients develop antibodies against HIV.\n\nThe approach, known as \u2018germline targeting,\u2019 involves triggering \u201cnaive B cells\u201d in bodies to produce broadly neutralising antibodies that, in turn, fight the pathogen.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Arogbonlo Israel\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Youths Frontier has frowned at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) invitation of its party official on alleged misappropriation of N10 billion.\n\nRecall EFCC on Monday, 17 May, invited three national officers of the PDP for investigation for alleged criminal conspiracy, abuse of office, diversion of funds and fraud.\n\nThe letter dated May 17th 2021 and addressed to the Prince Uche Secondus, the party\u2019s National chairman asked the National Auditor, National Organising Secretary and Director of Finance to report at the EFCC headquarters from May 19th to 21st 2021.\n\nScreenshot of the EFCC invitation letter below;\n\nReacting, the PDP Youth Group in a statement signed by Usman Okai Wednesday, said while it is against any form of corruption within the party, it insisted that, \u201cthe right channels must be explored and adopted and that, it is the only INEC (the electoral umpire) and main supervisory organ of political parties in the country that can carry out any investigation into any party\u2019s financial activities not the EFCC\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads partly:\n\n\u201cIt has come to the notice of the Peoples Democratic Party Youth Frontier that the federal government of Nigeria has devised a plan to begin a round of witch hunts of members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIn a letter dated May 17, 2021 and addressed to the National Chairman of the PDP \u2013 Prince Uche Secondus: the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had invited our National Auditor, National Organizing Secretary and Director of Finance to report to the EFCC headquarters between May 19 and May 21.\n\n\u201cThis, as far as we are concerned, is the Party\u2019s internal affair. The jurisdiction of the EFCC does not extend to investgating internal party wrangling. The EFCC is therefore acting outside its powers by inviting the above named persons.\n\n\u201cOne of the points raised by the EFCC is that, they want to verify the proceeds from the sale of forms. It is unheard of and laughable that the EFCC seeks to turn itself into the de facto auditor of the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the EFCC has lost its focus. It is chasing political parties whose funds have nothing to do with government funds, while there are people who have outstanding cases in court concerning embezzlement of government funds from the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe Integrity Group, a Port Harcourt based nonprofit organisation, had written a petition to the EFCC and President Muhammadu Buhari that, a former governor of Rivers state cum present minister had stolen \u00a3500million as governor.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC denied ever receiving the petition that was written in 2018. Instead, he was made minister- a clear case of what is good for APC is not good for PDP.\n\n\u201cOn August 3, 2020, the EFCC received a petition from the True Freedom and Good Governance group to probe the current minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio and the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission ( NDDC), Kemebradikumo Pondei of diverting N81.5 billion.\n\n\u201cAkpabio is still the minister of Niger Delta Affairs and Pondei of the \u2018Off Your Mic Gate\u2019 is still walking as a free man after that epic fainting- a clear indication that the so called President Buhari war on corruption is selective. Like the erstwhile chairman of APC, who coincidentally is from Edo state declared: once you are in APC, your sins are forgiven, regardless of how grave there are- no man does wrong in APC he suggested.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the reports of many cases of corruption on the table of the EFCC which have either been swept under the carpet or forgotten.\n\n\u201cThese are the affairs that should concern the EFCC for now. It is not to chase the largest party in West Africa around. Go after the real culprits and recover looted funds, especially now that the country is in dire need of financial injection to the economy ruined by APC, under the stewardship of president Buhari. Why do we have to borrow when we have people who are keeping more than half of the country\u2019s GDP as personal funds?\n\n\u201cWe are alerting the public on the precedence being set by the ruling party. This is not about the PDP. But, if this is allowed to stand by people of good reasoning and conscience, then, this country is with military speed precision sliding into totalitarianism. By implication, there may not be opposition structure to contest with the APC in 2023 and beyond- a betrayal of the struggle towards the institutionalization of democracy PDP started.\n\n\u201cTo be categorical about our stand, we do not condone corruption as a party- EFCC is a brain child of the People\u2019s Democratic Party. The party has internal mechanisms put in place to address internal issues \u2013 more reason we are saying this matter is not within the purview of the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore calling on the EFCC to focus on matters within its area of special competence. The EFCC should resist the temptation of becoming a wing of APC.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Here, you deal with everything, from insurgency to kidnapping, to piracy off the Gulf of Guinea and you don\u2019t have such a large army and police force for a country of this size.\n\n\u201cThe only way you turn this thing around is that government has to build the trust of its people, to have the people working with the government to deal with criminality. That\u2019s how successful anti-criminal operations work.\n\n\u201cPeople willingly report those committing crime, working with police to identify criminals, same with the military on the insurgency situation. It\u2019s only when the community is on the side of the police and security services that they can turn around the situation.\u201d\n\nOn the expectations for Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections, Laing said: \u201c2023 is not alright. What happens in the elections is very crucial, not just for Nigeria, but Africa to the world. You (Nigeria) are a large democracy.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect election. There would be problems, but we want it to be better than the last one. We want it to be secure, peaceful, the process should be run well, and you need to get people to register.\u201d\n\nOn her choice of candidates, she said: \u201cMy ideal candidates would be two younger presidential candidates, both with female vice presidential candidates,\u201d apparently referring to the two leading political parties.\n\nTo Wike and Amaechi on the next Rivers State governorship election, she said: \u201cIt is essential that there\u2019s a peaceful election in Rivers State. It\u2019s going to be a crucial part of his (Wike) legacy, how the election goes in this state. We\u2019ve been saying the same thing to Amaechi.\n\n\u201cAnother thing we will be doing is to remind people that if people do incite violence or act violently, we will be prepared to deny them visas to the UK.

          "text": "By Tony Akowe, Abuja\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility Commission has accused government agencies of practically truncating the process of accountability and transparency in handling government revenue by failing to abide by the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\n\nThe Commission said over N1.2 trillion in revenue was still being withheld by defaulting agencies that have refused to remit their 80 percent operating Surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, adding that several MDAs still persist in defaulting and practically keeping money away from government reach for funding of its budget.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Commission said over 60 percent of government agencies have always failed to associate their annual budget with the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, the template for which annual federal government budgets is prepared.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Victor Muruaku who spoke while addressing Assembly Correspondents also indicted about 32 government agencies for failing to submit their audited account to the Commission to enable it calculate their operating Surplus which is supposed to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.\n\nAmong the agencies are the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corp, Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, National Broadcasting Commission, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Standard Organisation of Nigeria, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board, National Integrated Water Resources Management Commission, National Sports Commission, Administrative Staff College of Nigeria and National Business and Technical Examination Board among others.\n\nThe FRC Chairman said that while the Fiscal Responsibility Act provide for offences, it failed to make provision for sanction and punishment, thereby making implementation difficult\n\nMuruako said by the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007, government owned enterprises and Corporations are supposed to remit 80 percent of their operating Surplus to the CRF at the end of every year to make money available for government to fund the annual budget.\n\nAccording to him, through the persistent and continuous engagement of MDAs by the Fiscal Responsibility Commission and especially with the support of the National Assembly, the Federal Government\u2019s share of Operating Surplus from these Corporations has continued to increase over the years.\n\n\u201cFrom our records, the total figure paid as Operating Surplus since the establishment of the PRC to date is beyond N2.15 trillion which, by the way, could not have been possible without the Act and the Commission, given that there would have been no law, rule, regulation or institution requiring such returns.\n\n\u201cSadly, many MDAs still persist in defaulting and practically keeping money away from the federal government\u2019s reach for funding its budgets. Our records indicate that over N12 Trillion is still in the hands of defaulting MDAs.\n\n\u201cThese figures are confirmed from our analysis of the annual audited financial reports submitted to our Commission by the concerned Agencies. Much more is yet out there in the hands of MDAs that either have failed to dutifully audit their accounts or that have done so but choose not to forward copies of their audited financial reports to the Commission as required by law.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that some of the agencies have also developed the habit of writing to withdraw their audited account after the Commission must have calculated their operating Surplus which is done after the agencies has submitted such audited account.\n\nHe said further that from the agency\u2019s verification of government capital projects, it was discovered that 60 percent of Government agencies often undertaking more projects than they can handle because they fail to abide by the approved MTEF.\n\nHe also said that the penchant of approving new contracts by new government to the detriment of existing contracts as well as inadequate funding has led to several abandoned projects across the country.",

Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe said across the world, conflicts and coronavirus have gone hand in hand.\n\nHe noted that as governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel, adding that terrorism is no common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n\u201cAround the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.

Indeed, the resort to terror tactics, disregard to constitutional processes and disrespect for democratic standards to advance their interests of creating an ungovernable space in the region informed the decision of the Federal Government to outlaw IPOB.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe Operation RP in Enugu is the first in the line-up of our strategic plans to restore peace and order across the country\u201d adding that \u201cin the coming days, the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address the challenges of banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Governor Ugwuanyi said the occasion could not have come at a better time than now \u201cgiven the bourgeoning insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the exercise would herald the rejigging and re-tooling of the internal security architecture in the South East to bring it up to speed with emerging dimensions of criminality.\n\n\u201cThat expectation, in my judgment, seems more realisable with the reassuring presence of the Ag. Inspector-General of Police here today,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that his administration fully understands that the primary purpose of government is the security and welfare of the people, as enshrined in the Nigeria\u2019s constitution, Governor Ugwuanyi stated that \u201cpursuant to this leadership responsibility, we have strengthened our Neighbourhood Watch Associations, established Enugu State Forest Guards, which was a novel initiative of the South East Governors\u2019 Forum, and provided security patrol vehicles and communication gadgets to support the security agencies in our state.\u201d",

We have a military presence here. It has been here for many years training your military in counter insurgency and also sharing our experiences.\n\n\u201cThat this kind of challenges are not solved by the military means alone; ultimately it\u2019s about rebuilding trust with the people of this country and having a good offer as well as tackling the underline economic drive, unemployment\u201d.",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, launched 300 mini busses tagged, the First and Last Mile Bus (FLM) Scheme as an alternative to commercial motorcycle popularly known as okada.\n\nThe new buses are expected to ply the inner routes in the six local government areas and nine local council development areas where okada have been banned. No fewer than 2,000 buses expected in the first phase of the project while total number of busses for the project is 5,000.\n\nThe governor, however, said the total ban on okada might not be enforced until another two months to give people enough time to get their cowry cards, gauge their response to the scheme, and also measure the scheme\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nAnother 100 High Capacity Buses were also unveiled by the governor. He described the initiatives as part of measures to address insecurity and provide Lagosians with safe, affordable and resilient commuting options.\n\nSanwo-Olu added that the initiatives were part of efforts to achieve a fully integrated inter-modal transport system.\n\nHe promised his administration was working to fulfil its campaign promises to the people. Commissioner for Transportation, Fredric Oladeinde, said the FLM launch was to reiterate the state\u2019s commitment to develop an integrated multi-modal transport system that is safe, comfortable, and support the people\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nManaging Director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, (LAMATA), Abimbola Akinajo, described the FLM scheme as part of the Bus Reform Initiative conceived to develop a coherent, formalised and regulated transport system and network in state.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe FLM is the last layer of the Bus Reform Initiative for Lagos State, which comes from the Lagos State Transport master plan developed by LAMATA. The Bus Reform Initiative is a plan by government to ensure that over time our public transportation system moves from an unregulated framework to a regulated framework.\u201d\n\nThe FLM scheme will be operated by private operators that will work with the state. The government will support them under a Bus Finance Scheme, where the private operator is expected to make a 20 percent down payment to be eligible to come under the scheme.

          "title": "Analysts Differ on Buhari\u2019s Quest for Fresh N2.3tn External Loan",
          "text": "\u2022N\u2019Assembly considers request\n\n\u2022APC mortgaging nation\u2019s future, says PDP\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nFinancial analysts and the organised private sector yesterday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buhari: Insecurity grows propensity for conflict\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday launched a new operation to battle the rising insecurity in the South-east.\n\nHe also charged policemen in the region to be ruthless with secessionists.\n\nThe launch of the new security strategy, codenamed \u201cOperation RP\u201d is coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State was attacked and property burnt by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari said without security, economic opportunity would remain fragile and the propensity for conflict would grow, adding that military gains do not provide the whole solution.\n\nAlkali, at the launch of the operation in Enugu, charged policemen serving in the South-east region to deal ruthlessly with criminals and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing their will.\n\nHe urged policemen to be firm with criminals that may be threatening citizens within their area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe IG advised police personnel participating in the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police leadership and the entire nation are looking out for two major outcomes as you discharge your duties during this operation: first, to stabilise the security order in the South-east in the shortest possible time; second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the policemen to be civil with law-abiding citizens, respect the rights of the citizens and undertake the operation within the dictates of rule of law.\n\nHe, however, charged them to defend themselves against any armed group that might attempt to attack them, or any police assets and other critical national infrastructure.\n\nHe described the people of South-east as historically peaceful, tolerant, innovative, industrious and entrepreneurial, who are highly respected citizens that have made their marks in the field of academics, scientific inventions and commerce.\n\nHe, however, lamented that although the Igbo are a unique ethnic group that freely and peacefully lives with others across the country and within the South-east, the events of late had altered the positive narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence. This trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria police, military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 was conceptualised to ensure that \u201cwe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, expressed optimism that the operation would lead to the retooling of security architecture in the South-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s event could not have come at a better time than now giving the point of insecurity in the country. In the past week, we have been saddened by the spate of killings of security operatives in their line of duty and destruction of security infrastructure and other public institutions in Nigeria, especially in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that today\u2019s event will herald the rejigging and retooling of international security architecture in the South-east geopolitical zone to bring it up to speed with an emerging dimension of criminality.\u201d\n\nInsecurity Grows Propensity for Conflict\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned that without security, economic opportunity will remain fragile and the propensity for conflict will grow.\n\nHe also said that because of the post-COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and France must seize the chance to strengthen its economic and military ties.\n\nBuhari stated this in an article entitled: \u2018Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Nigeria and France Must Seize the Chance to Strengthen Military and Economic Ties,\u2019 published yesterday by a Paris-based magazine, Le Point.\n\nHe said across the world, conflict and coronavirus had not been far apart and the war against the coronavirus was one Nigeria was fully united with France in a strong determination to overcome.\n\nThe solution, according to him, therefore, is to improve those conditions, as it leaves the people vulnerable to indoctrination.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs governments have struggled to contain COVID-19, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cTerrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorists have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n\n\u201dWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation Occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe president said as the world emerges from COVID-19, there is a chance to rebuild.\n\n\u201cThough we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with the idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for all,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari stated that the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets.\n\nSaying in that context fate is generally linked, the president highlighted that Paris had been active in the common fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into a lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\n\u201dNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperation if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating across our borders to cut the head off their groups.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says proceeds of marginal fields used to augment FAAC\n\nNdubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe federal government is weighing some options as discussions with Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell Petroleum Development Company, begin over its plan for total divestment from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday in Abuja listed three possible options being considered as comprising a takeover of the company\u2019s stake in the oil and gas industry by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); acquisition by indigenous operators and involving a mixture of local players and other foreign independent operators in the process.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy giant has been gradually selling its onshore assets for over a decade in Nigeria.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (JV) SPDC, had recently indicated it would no longer continue to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ben van Beurden, however, said yesterday that its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nHe also told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHowever, Sylva who fielded questions from journalists on the issue stated that while the federal government is in consultations with the oil giant on the divestment move.\n\n\u201cSome actually feel that Shell should not hurriedly divest and to at least stay,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhere Shell has completely divested from a sector is not good for us.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the executive arm is discussing with the National Assembly on the quick passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), saying that the bill will be passed lastest next month.\n\nSylva said: \u201cI want to tell you that PIB is fully on course and we are very happy because we have focused on that for a long time and we had many meetings with the National assembly and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cToday, I believe that we are all basically satisfied with where we are. The National Assembly has given a timeline. They actually gave April but a few things happened. But give or take, I still believe that the passage of the PIB will not go beyond June.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that between now and June, they will pass the PIB. I don\u2019t think we are far away with the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the nation\u2019s future lies in its vast gas reserves, which have been abandoned for decades, adding that the development of the huge gas potential will fast-track the diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cUnfortunately, what should have helped us are the laws around the oil industry and this has not happened over the last 20 years we have been tinkering with the laws. And yet, this law will power a lot of progress in this industry because the problem we have in the gas sector in Nigeria is that there are no clear fiscal regimes in the legal framework.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing the country\u2019s gas reserves which currently stands at 203 trillion TCF, will not only create jobs but also open more linkages with other sectors of the economy.\n\nSylva stated that the 203 trillion proven gas reserves were discovered in the course of oil exploration, adding that a conscious exploration could yield as much as 600 trillion tcf.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople have become more aware of the need for us to move towards gas. Last year, one of the first things we were able to achieve was the NLG Train7 final investment decision (FID) that has eluded the country for a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the development of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves, over $16.1billion has so far come into the country as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nHe added that the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation programme is fully on course, while the autogas policy is being finetuned in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which is to bring in conversion kits and make soft loans available for marketers to fit their filling stations.\n\nFor the policy to work effectively, he said there must be enough vehicles and filling stations.\n\nOn the recent judgement against Nigeria by a Milan court on the Malabu oil deal, the minister stated that the decision on the next move would depend on legal advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe minister also said the $1.5 billion required for the proposed rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery had been secured, adding that putting the refineries in shape was necessary before considering what options are better to run them, including using operations and management (O&M) experts.\n\nOn subsidy removal, Sylva said the federal government did not lack the courage or political will to float petrol price, but was considering stakeholders\u2019 views.\n\nHe stated that proceeds of the recent sale of marginal fields from Signature Bonuses were used to augment the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for April.\n\nOn reports in the social media that he collected $25 million from Saipem to award a contract in LNG Train 7, he said the contracted had already been awarded to Saipem before his appointment.\n\nShell CEO: Nigeria Onshore Oil Incompatible with Company\u2019s Climate Strategy\n\nOil multinational, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yesterday shed more light on its decision to divest from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe company said its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nThe company stated that it had been under increasing pressure from investors to slash emissions and pivot toward cleaner energy, even as the tension was on show at its shareholder meeting yesterday.\n\nBloomberg reported that while speaking at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe balance of risks and rewards associated with our onshore portfolio is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta and the company has started discussions with the government on how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say explicitly that Shell wanted to sell the remainder of its oil assets in the Niger Delta, nor did he provide a timetable.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term energy transition plan laid out to investors for the first time received overwhelming support, but a competing resolution asking for stricter targets also garnered more votes than ever.\n\nAdding to the tension, shareholders were meeting as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas developments needed to stop immediately for climate targets to be met.\n\nShell also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria, where it has been pumping out oil for half a century.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has been gradually selling onshore assets in Nigeria for more than a decade, as it sought to put aside chronic problems such as pollution caused by ruptured pipelines and the resulting legal battles with local communities.\n\nThe issue has become more acute in the past year after Shell pledged to transform itself into a clean energy giant and gradually winds down its oil and gas business to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nYet a full retreat would be an obvious endpoint to years of gradual divestment, even as Shell has reduced its total number of onshore licences in Nigeria by half over the past decade and has been focusing on offshore oil fields and gas operations in the country.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 meeting was dominated by investors\u2019 questions on Shell\u2019s climate strategy, ranging from pleas to set more ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels, to a request that the company \u201cstop apologising\u201d for the products it sells.\n\nWhen asked about an IEA\u2019s new report on stopping new oil and gas fields, Chairman, Chad Holliday, said Shell hadn\u2019t had time to study the report but would do so in due course.\n\nShell\u2019s energy transition plans, which forecast a big expansion in clean energy but also decades more oil and gas production, received nearly 89 per cent votes, while a competing proposal from the group rose to 30 per cent, more than double a year earlier.\n\nShare this:

That is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act and we want him, we will bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for him, he should report to the nearest police station or report to us. He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him. Speaking while while leading a peaceful procession by workers on Tuesday in Kaduna, Wabba said the issue is not about him but about workers, adding that: \u201cWe are here and waiting for him to come and arrest us.

The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea.

          "text": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025. It is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\n\nBut there has been some recent progress. A tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%. Analysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\n\nWhatever the correct figure is, Nigeria still has some ways to go due to a mix of challenges, one of which is infrastructure and an inability to standardise fees. For broadband access to increase throughout the country, network operators have to dig up roads and lay optic fibre cables.\n\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments. But RoW fees are high and it is expensive to lay cables; so broadband connectivity suffers.\n\nWhile RoW is a source of revenue for state governments, the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract telcos to make a significant broadband investment. In 2020, MTN requested approval from the Ekiti state government to lay 160km of fibre optic cables after reducing its RoW fees.\n\nGovernors agree to slash Right of Way fees\n\nStandardising RoW fees is one way to encourage telcos to make investments in broadband infrastructure, so in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s 36 governors agreed to an important step \u2013 a standardised RoW fee of \u20a6145/m.\n\nSo far, only Kaduna, Ekiti, Katsina, Plateau, Ekiti, Kwara, Anambra, and Imo are implementing the new fees one year after the agreement. States like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge N2,500, N4,000, N750 per Linear Meter.\n\nIt is unclear why these states are not implementing the new fees, but stakeholders continue to mount pressure regardless. There are reports that the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) is looking at signing a Memorandum of Understanding with states to bring down RoW charges.\n\nThere have also been discussions on the floor of the National Assembly, but it has not translated into lower fees mostly because the governors reserve the right to fix these fees.\n\nRegardless of this power, the governors of the remaining 29 states must play the long game and lower prices because deepening broadband penetration is a big win for Nigeria as a whole.",

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",

          "text": "In March, Nigerian startup Termii raised $1.4 million in a seed round. Future Africa co-led the round with Kepple Africa Ventures, a Japanese Africa-focused venture capital firm.\n\nIt is not clear how much Future Africa invested in Termii but the firm can invest up to $500,000 in deals, thanks to the Future Africa Collective, its community of angel investors.\n\nIt turns out Future Africa has done a dozen other deals since. Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Healthtech startup, APEX Medical Labs, is helping Malawians get specialised diagnostic healthcare",
          "text": "Located in the South-Eastern region of Africa, Malawi has 83% of its population living in rural communities. This explains the strong dependence on the government for public amenities, including health facilities. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 67% of the country\u2019s healthcare is handled by the government, and the private sector barely takes care of the 1% left behind by non-profit organisations.\n\nDiagnosis is an important part of treatment, but existing facilities in the country do not have the capacity for certain medical tests, or the equipment is faulty when they are required. Consequently, some doctors do not suggest tests to patients; they would rather adopt alternative means or advise them to travel outside the country.\n\nIn 2017, two medical lab technologists, Kundai Moyo and Taziona Mzumara thought this shouldn\u2019t be and began working on a solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of the specialised tests were being sent to South Africa or India. So we thought again to address this gap or rather have our population have access to these diagnostic services closer to home, and faster so that they also get quality services,\u201d explains Kundai Moyo, Co-founder and Operations Director at APEX Medical Laboratories.\n\nMoyo\u2019s understanding of the situation came from her 16 years of practice and the opinions of some doctors.\n\n\u201cWe did a survey among some of the doctors, we noted that most of the time they don\u2019t use laboratory services, not because they don\u2019t need them but because they are not available, or most of the time they are faulty,\u201d she adds.\n\nEstablishing a niche\n\nAt first, the Malawi market appeared to be unripe for such an intervention considering the small population that visits private hospitals. Of this number, there\u2019s even a smaller fraction who can afford the service. But Moyo soon realised that it could be used to the startup\u2019s advantage.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on those that can pay, but I think there are other opportunities. For example, public-private partnerships, and also to expand to other cities, especially for the tests that are unique to us because we have tests we\u2019ve introduced in Malawi that have not been there. No one else is providing them currently,\u201d she boasts.\n\nBut first, she had to build the necessary capacity.\n\nBefore getting their first client in July 2018, Moyo got admitted into the African Women Entrepreneurship Cooperative to learn the basis for entrepreneurship for three months. She considers this knowledge invaluable to the progress the startup has made.\n\nIt was within the same period that the startup got the business certification, and the founders bootstrapped funds to secure a space. They also got their first set of test equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all this in place, the startup devised different means to tackle the challenge by making sure it is at the client\u2019s convenience.\n\n\u201cAt APEX, we are driven by this and want to make sure that we bring a cooperative service that is unique to Malawi and to prevent the sending of clients samples outside the country to India or South Africa. But at the same time bring a unique service that our clients can be served in their home or at the doctor of their choice without being moved from one clinic to the other,\u201d Moyo notes.\n\nNow, APEX Medical Laboratories not only focuses on people who walk into the facility to request tests. It also targets private practising doctors, public and private hospitals, health insurance companies, and health organisations.\n\nInterestingly, feedback from all these entities has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s only about 20% or less that walk into the facility. 80% come from outside \u2014 referred from clinics, doctors, private doctors, and hospitals and organisations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moyo, the startup now boasts of servicing 3,000 individuals from 30 clinics, 3 health organisations, and several private doctors.\n\nBut achieving this wasn\u2019t easy. At the start, it involved convincing hospitals and health centres of its services. Finally, the startup strategically located a lab within another facility as a form of partnership.\n\n\u201cWe have other agreements with these big hospitals that don\u2019t have those particular services they want us to provide\u2014for example, HIV Virology PCR. We have an agreement with them that all their clients for this particular test, they direct to us,\u201d Kundai reveals.\n\nThis arrangement also applies to some health insurance companies that would have normally suggested tests for their clients abroad.\n\nBespoke service delivery\n\nDepending on the test requested from the 86 medical tests that APEX Medical Laboratories offers, a client may have to spend between $5 and $100.\n\nFor its mobile (on the road) and home test services, the lab receives requests through messaging platforms like its website, social media platform, and WhatsApp \u2014 where it can track the location of a client.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has grown steadily.\n\n\u201cIn terms of growth, I think we were growing even when we weren\u2019t making a profit. From 2018 to 2019, I think we did like 300%; 2019 to 2020, about 400%; and then 2020 to 2021, about 95% growth.\u201d\n\nGoing by this, Moyo says the startup is making up to $15,000 in monthly revenue but only started making a profit in 2020.\n\nOn how the business has handled demand \u2014 even other laboratories outsource to the startup \u2014 the startup has enjoyed a few external fundings.\n\nPost-revenue in 2019, the startup participated in the Growth Accelerator Malawi entrepreneurship challenge and won a $48,000 grant. In 2020, it bagged $16,000 in grants from the Malawi Entrepreneurship COVID Challenge. It has also gained exposure through a program organised by Africa-focused publication, Yale African Startup Review (YASR).\n\nFor now, the startup only operates in Malawi\u2019s capital city, Lilongwe. However, as it grows in capacity and gets more funds, it plans to expand to Blantyre by June 2021.\n\nLeveraging other tech solutions\n\nApart from the basic test equipment, the startup has acquired machines adapted for more than one test.\n\nIn 2020, for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic when the government authorised the startup to carry out COVID-19 tests, the lab adapted the HIV testing equipment for COVID-19 tests.\n\nAsides from that, APEX Medical Laboratories has also adopted a data information software.\n\n\u201cWhat we call the laboratory information management system or ELDS where we have the information for the client, what kind of condition they have, who the doctor requesting is, and what kind of test, then their result,\u201d Moyo describes.\n\nWith time, doctors referring patients to the lab can quickly access the medical history of new and returning clients. The founder says the startup plans to strongly leverage this in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are using it to understand the diseases because you\u2019ll be responding to the needs of the client in terms of what services we need to focus on, which is important for the different population,\u201d she adds.\n\nApart from the ease this brings to clients, the system is also helping the business with proper documentation and service delivery.\n\nWhile the startup works towards growing its team beyond six specialists, it plans to expand into other African countries before the end of 2024.\n\nAs it is, Moyo and her team plan to keep evolving to grow the brand further. She believes this is possible given the conducive business environment that the country provides, especially for female entrepreneurs.\n\nFeatured image credit: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nEmmanuel and Chimgozirim here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nNew or not so new logistics regulations\n\nUber, Lagos, and lost items\n\nThe race to build Africa\u2019s crypto infrastructure\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s 2021 investment so far\n\nNew? logistics regulations in Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian government has approved what seems to be new regulations for the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). It also approved a rulemaking process which, it states, would establish NIPOST as a regulator in the logistics sector.\n\nThe rule is termed: The Courier and Logistics Services (Operations) Regulations and will provide a regulatory framework for Nigeria\u2019s logistics sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. In 2020, NIPOST released a regulation with the same name but to huge backlash and outrage. The regulations increased licencing fees for logistics operators, and they were also required to remit 2% of their revenue to the NIPOST.\n\nDespite the fact that NIPOST regulations are subject to Ministerial approval, Dr Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s ICT minister feigned ignorance at the rules and ordered NIPOST to back down.\n\nWhat has changed? The government only stated that it has approved new regulations, but no details have been revealed yet. Have the controversial provisions been removed? How will this impact the logistics sector?\n\nLet\u2019s dive into this rabbit hole later today. It should be interesting.\n\nWhat have you lost lately on Uber?\n\nHave you been in the city of Lagos on a typical Monday morning? You would likely find it doused with the smell of vehicle exhaust and the desperation of commuters.\n\nYou think you\u2019re lucky: You ordered an Uber so you don\u2019t have to jump Danfos (commercial yellow buses), but guess what, no one is safe. You would still have to chill in hot traffic.\n\nNo surprise then when Uber stated that Lagosians are the most guilty of forgetting items at the end of their trips. And it happens the most on, you guessed it, Mondays and Sundays.\n\nSome of the items forgotten include the regular culprits like keys and wrist watches but also things you wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to forget like cameras and laptops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, you could retrieve these items\u2026.hopefully.\n\nCheck back later today to find out what other items people left behind.\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s 2021 investment\n\nNigeria\u2019s Future Africa fund says it has invested $3 million in 13 African startups so far in 2021, double the investments made in 2020. Founded by serial entrepreneur, Iyin Aboyeji in 2020, Future Africa is on a mission to provide early-stage funding for African innovators.\n\nMore funding for female-led startups: Earlier this year, Iyin stated the firm\u2019s desire to invest at least $1 million in female founders. Going by the announcement, it would seem that the goal has been reached. While they declined to mention all startups that have been funded, of the four mentioned, we can confirm that Lami has a woman on its founding team.\n\nCan you take advantage of this? For a yearly subscription fee of $1000, individuals can take part in funding Africa\u2019s future where they can invest a minimum of $5000 yearly. Limited Partners can invest up to $25,000 yearly.\n\nWe go into more detail here.\n\nMore African founders are getting involved in providing early-stage funding for African entrepreneurs. Piggyvest co-founder Odunayo Eweniyi and Endeavor Nigeria MD, Eloho Omame recently launched a fund for female founders. Iroko TV founder Jason Njoku has also been involved in providing funds for entrepreneurs through SPARK and later Investzilla.\n\nAfrica\u2019s crypto Infrastructure\n\nNot long ago, I had a series of interviews with several crypto startup founders. At the time, it seemed like every time I checked my inbox, there would always be a crypto startup pitching a story. To be honest, it felt strange and intriguing.\n\nThose series of interviews helped me understand the space and gave birth to some interesting stories. Like how Nigerian youth dominate the crypto surge, how the Nigerian government could leverage it for growth, how to think about regulations, and several exciting use cases for crypto.\n\nA clear pattern: A major gap we noticed was a clear dearth of blockchain, and by extension, crypto infrastructure.\n\nFor crypto startups to thrive, there has to be a technology infrastructure powering it, and most of them starting out have to get liquidity (enough cash to power through the early stages).\n\nQuidax, one of Nigeria\u2019s earliest exchanges, launched in 2017 at a time when crypto was only a whisper and a tale for most Nigerians.\n\nWe had a chat with CEO Buchi Okoro on the company\u2019s journey which started from building trust in WhatsApp groups to creating an exchange that currently averages nearly a billion dollars worth of yearly transactions.\n\nRead: Nigerian crypto startup, Quidax, is building Africa\u2019s crypto infrastructure one major market at a time\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHomzmart raises $15m\n\nSeriously, Egyptian startups need to show everyone the secret. This is the third funding round of over a million dollars in the MENA region this week. Co-founded by Mahmoud Ibrahim, COO of Daraz and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics, Jumia, the startup has secured $15 million to build its furniture marketplace. There\u2019s more.\n\nEgypt-based last-mile delivery company, Bosta, raises $6.4m Series A. Read\n\nSafaricom\u2019s end of fiscal year report shows an increase in Internet data revenue.

          "title": "Pension contributors navigate maze of PFAs for better returns",
          "text": "The quest for higher returns and better service delivery are driving mass movement of pension contributors to other Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) under the newly approved transfer window.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that PFAs that have remained conservative, sluggish in carrying their contributors and retirees along in terms of engagement and communications are largely being affected.\n\nAccording to latest figures released by the National Pension Commission (PenCom), the number of contributors that have moved has risen by 353 percent to a total of 12,681 in the Transfer Quarter that ended March 31, 2021, from a total number of 2,799 Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders in the maiden Transfer Quarter that ended December 31, 2020.\n\nPenCom says the number more than quadrupled in the last transfer quarter, and expect consistently upward trend, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs.\n\n\u201cOverall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry,\u201d the industry regulator states.\n\nMost of the movement is happening in RSA FUND II, which is the default fund for all Active Contributors who are below 50 years old, an industry source says.\n\nThe PenCom notes in a statement that the launching of the RSA Transfer System (RTS) on November 16, 2020, heralded the full implementation of one of the cardinal features of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), the portability of RSAs.\n\nRead Also: Pension operators partner AVCA to empower local investors on private equity\n\n\u201cBy this development, RSA holders have been empowered to move their RSAs from their current PFAs to other PFAs of their choice, whenever they desire to do so,\u201d it notes.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the opening of the \u2018Transfer Window,\u2019 as it is popularly referred to, has been embraced by a large number of RSA holders in their quest for better service delivery and returns on investment from PFAs.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has ensured that the requirements for initiating RSA transfers are minimal, and has also been made available on its website, necessary information to guide RSA holders through the process. Specifically, its publication of the \u2018Frequently Asked Questions\u2019 on RSA transfers, provides RSA holders with all they need to know about RTS.\n\n\u201cThe RTS is a fully automated, efficient and transparent process that has pre-defined timelines. It ensures hassle free movement of RSAs across PFAs,\u201d Commission.\n\nAs the transfer of RSAs involves movement of pension assets between PFAs, the entire process attracts the full weight of the Commission\u2019s regulatory surveillance, the PenCom notes. The fact that the process has been completely free of charge has also given RSA holders an added advantage, it states.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming response by RSA holders to the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is, therefore, not surprising. In the maiden Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 December 2020, a total number of 2,799 RSA holders transferred their RSAs to various PFAs. This number more than quadrupled in the next Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 March 2021, as a total number of 12,681 RSA transfers took place,\u201d the Commission discloses.\n\nAccording to Olumide Oyetan, chief executive, Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers, in an interview with BusinessDay recently, the transfer window is a positive development for the pension industry as it gives RSA holders the freedom to change their initial selection of a PFA to their preferred service provider based on attributes that are important to them.\n\n\u201cFor us as a company, the transfer window has given us the opportunity to welcome new clients and continually improve our technology and services to meet most of our clients\u2019 needs,\u201d he said.\n\nLeveraging our various educative programmes, the transfer window also gives us the opportunity to enlighten a wider audience, thereby boosting confidence in the Nigerian pension industry as well as the larger financial services industry, he stated.\n\nIbrahim Alhassan Babayo, chairman, Board of Directors, Premium Pensions Limited, said during the company\u2019s annual general meeting that the long-awaited Transfer Window had shifted power to the contributors as they now have the opportunity to switch from one PFA to another.\n\nThe opportunities to move when dissatisfied have an implication on Assets under Management (AUM), though reported that Premium Pension Limited was a net gainer during the maiden Transfer Window quarter, he said.\n\nA consistently upward trend is anticipated, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs. Overall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Act that established the Scheme, the objectives of this scheme is to ensure that every person who worked in either the public service of the Federation, Federal Capital Territory, states and local government or the private sector receives his retirement benefits as and when due; and to assist improvident individuals by ensuring that they save in order to cater for their livelihood during old age.\n\nIn the case of the private sector, the Scheme shall apply to employees who are in the employment of an organisation in which there are three or more employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the provision of subsection (2) of this section, employee of organisation with less than three employees as well as self-employed persons shall be entitled to participate under the scheme in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission.",

          "text": "As coronavirus closed businesses around the world and forced millions to stay home, Nigeria\u2019s film industry produced more local movies in 2020 compared to previous four years.\n\nThe arrival of the deadly COVID-19 alongside a nationwide lockdown led to a halt in film and TV productions, costing estimated tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings. However, film producers tried to focus on high-quality movies, growing cinema audiences, as lockdown was eased, and the likes of Netflix pushed to tap into the country\u2019s over 200 million population.\n\nDespite COVID-19 challenges, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show the number of movies produced surged by 477.6 percent to 2,599 in 2020, the highest when compared to 450 movies in 2017. In 2018 and 2019, it produced 565 and 700 movies, respectively\n\nThe NBS data also show that the number of movies produced in quarter one of 2021 stood at 416, almost close to what was made in 2017.\n\nBy location, Lagos had the highest with 149, closely followed by Onitsha with 140 movies, Benin City and Bauchi recorded two movies each, respectively. From the record, data were provided by the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) and verified and validated by the NBS.\n\nExperts in the movie industry have said that the challenges surrounding COVID-19 triggered a new height of creativity among Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cThe fact that more movies were produced in a disruptive year 2020 signals the resilience of the sector, and also highlights that the sector is gradually living up to its potentials,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nRead Also: Eyimofe to premiere in Nigerian cinemas after success at world\u2019s film festivals\n\nSamuel Oniyitan, a movie producer, says the lockdown period provided the time and a little sense of sanity for most of them to write different stories, noting, \u201cBefore the lockdown, we really don\u2019t have much time to write enough stories.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative industry is one of the most vibrant in Africa. In recent years, the sector has seen a period of rapid progress facilitated by emerging digital technology, which supports content creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC Nigeria), Nollywood, the second largest film producer in the world, contributed 2.3 percent to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2016. The industry is reported to generate between $500 million and $1 billion annually and is usually busy towards the end of the year.\n\nLast year, Nigerian cinemas closed for six months had to depend on quality local movie content from Nollywood to stay afloat because of the drop in foreign contents.\n\nNollywood took advantage of the lack of foreign content by releasing quality local contents like Omo Ghetto, Fate of Alakada, Quam\u2019s Money, Dear Affy, Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story, Who\u2019s the Boss, This Lady Called Life, Voiceless, \u00ccf\u00e9, Introducing The Kujus, that glued the Nigerian audience to various online platforms during the lockdown and the cinemas across the country, when lockdown was eased.\n\nIn order to increase its less than 50,000 Nigerian subscribers, last year, Netflix, a global on-demand movie streaming company increased its Nollywood originals on its video streaming platform and also collaborated with Nollywood directors and producers to churn out more local Netflix originals.\n\nRobert Onyeri, a professional filmmaker, says young filmmakers are doing a phenomenal job in reinventing the Nollywood wheel, breaking from the norm, crafting fresh narratives and style on how we tell our stories. \u201cIt would do Nollywood a lot of good to foster and not stifle these young filmmakers,\u201d he states.\n\nDespite the growth in movie production, stakeholders have lamented the insufficient support from the present administration as against the previous President Goodluck Jonathan administration that set up the Nigerian Creative and Entertainment Industry Stimulation $200 million Loan Scheme meant to address major issues in the industry \u2013 distribution, capacity building and content production.\n\n\u201cThere is no funding and structure in place. Goodluck did it and it worked because many people benefited from it,\u201d an official from Filmone Cinemas says.",

Therefore, we can no longer afford to ignore actions against greenhouse effects.\n\n\u201cIt is to this end that these sets of standards and the other approved standards in this category are considered very important, timely and instruments for actions to support energy sufficiency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director general said that the standards would also mitigate the negative effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cAs these standards are launched today, opportunities for fair trade practices, lowered cost of manufacture/assembly, consumer satisfaction, business expansion, employment creation and career development will all be enhanced.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to comply with all the requirements of these standards to ensure good manufacturing practices and the best product quality that will satisfy all consumers at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nSalim explained that the SON would carry out stakeholders awareness campaign and strict enforcement to ensure that manufacturers, project developers and users complied with the new standards.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that representatives of relevant government agencies, international partners and other stakeholders in the power sector were present at the launch.\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission(NERC), Federal Ministry of Power, the Nigerian National Committee of IEC/Technical Committee were among the relevant institutions that sent their goodwill messages to SON.\n\nEngr. Peter Ewesor, NEMSA Managing Director and Chief Electrical Inspector of the Federation, said that the launch was a milestone in the effort toward enforcement of standards and regulations.\n\nHe said that NEMSA enforcement team would work with SON to ensure that manufacturers of electrical materials and installations upheld stipulated standards.\n\n...",

          "text": "The ongoing five-day warning strike by labour unions in Kaduna State will cost the state huge economic losses, a university don has warned.\n\nTerhemba Wuam, a professor of Economic History at Kaduna State University, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna.\n\nHe said the poor masses would be left to bear the burden.\n\nNAN recalls that the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) on Monday began a five-day warning strike over a plan to sack civil servants by the state government.\n\nThe strike, which entered day three on Wednesday, had crippled economic activities in the state with the government and business owners counting their losses.\n\nAccording to the professor, the suspension of electricity supply, closures of petrol stations and the shutdown of economic activities will have huge economic consequences for the government and the people.\n\n\u201cThe state government says it is rightsizing its civil service so as not to be spending a larger portion of its money on civil servants.\n\n\u201cLabour, on the other hand, is saying, \u2018do not sack our members in the name of right sizing\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhile both are right in their arguments, there is something both parties are missing in this unending debate \u2013 the strategic role of recurrent expenditure in the development of the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the labour unions failed to put up an argument that when the government pay salaries, \u201cit is not only the civil servants that consume what the state gets from the federation account.\u201d\n\nMr Wuam explained that when the government pays salaries, it workers use the money in training millions of children in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions, critical in human capital development.\n\n\u201cThe labour union should tell the government that it is the money they earn as salaries that service half of the state in terms of ensuring that education, health and other government services are delivered.\n\n\u201cBoth labour unions and the government are missing this point,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lecturer further pointed out the overwhelming emphasis on the importance of capital projects, stressing, however, that recurrent expenditure could even be more important.\n\nHe noted that although capital projects might provide the buildings, the roads and other infrastructure, at the level of the country\u2019s growth and development, the multiplier effect might be limited.\n\n\u201cFor example, when you pay a Chinese company N10 billion for capital projects executed, that money goes to China.\n\n\u201cBut if you pay Kaduna State civil servants that N10 billion, they train your citizens, provide health services to the citizens, collect taxes and the money is retained within the economy.\n\n\u201cThe government has its valid point, but the labour unions have to make the government understand, through dialogue, that what they are fighting for will contribute to the state\u2019s development agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Wuam advised the state government and the labour unions to consider going to the negotiating table as fast as possible as a better option in the interest of both parties and residents of the state.\n\nHe said the most important thing at this point was for both parties to reach a middle ground so that what they were fighting for would be for the development of Kaduna State.\n\nThe economic historian further stressed the need for a rethink around the economy.\n\nHe said that considering the level of states and federal governments\u2019 financial obligations, simply downsizing or managing the \u201cnational cake\u201d as it was would no longer be sufficient.\n\nAccording to him, economic productivity will have to be doubled within a decade or stand the risk of total collapse.\n\nHe said the fundamentals for doubling the rate of economic growth exists and must be tapped by the government, people of the state and the country.\n\n(NAN)",

The Central Bank of Nigeria stands ready to support youths that are willing to engage in agriculture.\u201d\n\nHe added that under the 2020 wet season CBN-RIFAN partnership, the bank had also financed 221,450 farmers for the cultivation of 221,450 hectares in 32 states.\n\nThe governor said the CBN planned a minimum one million hectares of rice through a combination of RIFAN farmers and prime/private anchors for each planting season in 2021.\n\nHe restated the bank\u2019s resolve to partner with the fiscal authorities to ensure the integration of Nigerian farmers into the government\u2019s Economic Sustainability Programme aimed at providing five million homes with electricity using solar energy.\n\nHe also urged farmers to repay their loans in order to sustain the ABP.\n\nHe said every farmer with a good repayment record in the programme would be eligible to get a solar home system that would provide electricity to power their essential home appliances.\n\nEmefiele said the bank would develop a repayment framework that would allow farmers to use their farm produce as repayment for the electricity consumed by the beneficiaries of the scheme.\n\n\u201cLoan repayment is the hallmark of every credit cycle and the sustainability of the programme is hinged on farmers\u2019 ability and willingness to repay their loans, and we are constantly engaging with them to enhance their trust in the system,\u201d he added",

Today\u2019s launch of Operation RP by the Nigeria Police follows the directives of Mr. President to the Nigeria Police to re-evaluate and emplace new operational strategies to stem the tide of violence and secessionist agenda not only in the South-East but across the country.\u201d\n\nBaba added, \u201cIndeed, the resort to terror tactics, disregard to constitutional processes and disrespect for democratic standards to advance their interests of creating an ungovernable space in the region informed the decision of the Federal Government to outlaw IPOB.\u201d",

          "text": "In an article published in the French news magazine, Le Point, President Muhammadu Buhari admitted the gains made by Boko Haram insurgents against the Nigerian military.\n\nBut he blames the COVID-19 pandemic for the gains made by the Jihadist rebels.\n\nHe wrote:\u201dAcross the world, conflict and Coronavirus have not been far apart. As governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa\u2026 Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger\u201d.\n\nRead the full article titled: POST-COVID-19 PANDEMIC, NIGERIA AND FRANCE MUST SEIZE THE CHANCE TO STRENGTHEN MILITARY AND ECONOMIC TIES.\n\nToday, leaders from across Africa meet in Paris to discuss plans to recover from the impact of a common enemy \u2013 COVID-19. But for African nations from across the Sahel region and beyond, the issues are inseparable from the fight against another common enemy which is terrorism. And like the war against the Coronavirus, it is one we are fully united with France in our strong determination to overcome.\n\nAcross the world, conflict and Coronavirus have not been far apart. As governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa. Terrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.\n\nWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon. It has demonstrated why pushing against one front can prove futile if groups can simply migrate to ponds of insecurity across porous borders. Yet as instability has spread, so the networks that sustain it have strengthened \u2013 whether that be weapons supply chains from Libya, ideological imports of Al-Qaeda and ISIS from the Middle East, or trafficking networks that take money from those escaping instability and feeds it back into the system that generates it.\n\nMeanwhile the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets. In that context, our fate is linked. Hence Paris has been active in this common fight. The French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\nNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperations if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\nIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\nHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\n\nIn the Sahel, crises converge. Traditionally, this vast arid land has been poorer than its Mediterranean neighbours to the north and fertile land to its South. Now, climate change and environmental degradation squeeze the region of water sources, draining opportunity and increasing competition amongst various groups for scarce resources. The fallout from Libya has flushed the whole region with weapons, making any disputes and competition far more destructive. And it is upon these conditions, the lies and propaganda of terrorists who falsely claim to be Islamists promising salvation can find an audience. Islam is a religion of peace.\n\nTo counteract these, we must focus on initiatives that sustainably spread opportunity far and wide across the Sahel. Transport links across the Sahel have become dilapidated, much of it still the remnants of the colonial era. For the region\u2019s burgeoning young population, reinvigorating these links or building anew is critical. It allows for efficient allocation of labour; the movement of inputs such as seed, fertiliser or equipment to the areas that need it; and freight to take produce or extractives to market or value-add factories.\n\nNow, as the world emerges from the pandemic, we have the chance to build back better. Though we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with that idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for both of us.",

          "text": "Coalition under the aegis of the Yoruba Appraisal Forum (YAF) , on Tuesday, in Akure, Ondo State, warned South-West youths against aiding terrorism by certain groups and individuals acting under the guise of agitating for an independent Yoruba nation.\n\nYAF stated that Yoruba youths should be cautious and vigilant to avoid unknowingly aiding or participating in terrorist activities under unpatriotic groups and individuals claiming to be fighting for an independent Yoruba nation, warning that partaking in such nefarious activities, willingly or unwillingly, could have serious consequences for them.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s National Coordinator, Adeshina Animashaun, gave this warning while addressing members and residents of Akure, the Ondo State capital , during a motorcade organised to sensitise the people of the state to the unpatriotic activities of groups and individuals parading themselves in the South-West as champions of Yoruba self-determination and independence.\n\nA huge crowd of okada riders and people carrying placards with various inscriptions advising Yoruba against violence and dancing to music provided by a live band, went round Akure and other parts of the state distributing handbills and leaflets urging the people of the South-West not to be deceived by the antics of those claiming to be fighting Yoruba cause. Some of the inscriptions on the YAF placards also enjoined the youths to eschew violence, live in peace with other residents of their states and report suspected troublemakers to the nearest security agency.\n\nAnimashaun, who led hundreds of other members and residents during the motorcade, also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, the service chiefs, the inspector general of police, governors of the six South-West states and other major stakeholders in Yorubaland to rise to the challenge and stop the plans by secession agitators to instigate violence in the region.\n\nThe YAF national coordinator stated that the warning became imperative following the alarm raised in certain quarters that the entire South-West geo-political zone might have been surrounded by terrorists.\n\nLast Wednesday, second republic senator and renowned Historian, Prof. Banji Akintoye, had alleged that some terrorists planned to attack the entire Yorubaland with the objective of wrecking the economy of the area.\n\nBut the YAF national coordinator said that the government and security agencies should examine Akintoye\u2019s claim thoroughly to ascertain that he was not merely giving a hint of what his group had in the offing, considering his past utterances and antecedents in support of the secession of Yorubaland from the rest of Nigeria.\n\nAnimashaun said, \u201cAkintoye knows much more than we all think he knows. He should be questioned regarding this particular alarm he\u2019s raising because his antecedents and utterances as well as those of the members of his group advocating and agitating for secession of the South-West and disintegration of the Nigerian nation are issues that must be properyly examined vis-\u00e0-vis the alarm he\u2019s now raising of some people planning to attack South-West. We just hope he\u2019s not giving an inkling of what they have in the offing in the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only just advise our innocent youths to be careful of joining such unpatriotic groups in order not find themselves fighting the wrong cause when it\u2019s already too late to back out and falling on the wrong side of the law. Our youths should avoid being recruited to support and fight the cause of terrorist groups under the guise of agitating for an Oodua Republic or independent Yoruba nation.\u201d\n\nThe YAF coordinator, therefore, advised the Federal Government and the governors of the six South-West states to ensure the deployment of adequate number of security agents throughout the region and Yorubaland to forestall plans by any groups of persons or individuals to instigate violence and cause chaos and destruction in the area.\n\nAnimashaun enjoined all well-meaning Yoruba youths to join hands and rise against terrorism and agitation for secession by groups or individuals covering up to cause chaos and endanger the lives and property of people of the South West and indeed Nigeria.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe cannot fold our arms and watch a few criminals in the name of secession to unleash terror in the South West.\n\n\u201cIt is a fight by all against these enemies of state and should not be left to government alone.\n\n\u201cWe must all be vigilant and report suspicious movements to the nearest security agency within our areas.\u201d\n\nThe Forum\u2019s coordinator also enjoined traditional rulers throughout Yorubaland to rise in defence of the region and their communities by warning youths in their domains to eschew violence and not to allow themselves to be cajoled into joining terrorist groups by those pretending to be agitating for an independent Yoruba nation.\n\nAnimashau also advised parents to warn their children of the consequences of crime and treason.\n\nThe YAF coordinator restated the Forum\u2019s call on the Department of State Services (DSS), the police and other security agencies to clampdown on secession agitators in the South West and across the country to avert anarchy and address the security challenges confronting the nation.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our stand rejecting calls by a group led by self-styled Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho and others, that Yorubaland should secede from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAny plot to destabilise Yorubaland will not work and we will resist it. Enough wasting of innocent lives in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe agitators cannot and do not speak for Yoruba youths. Our governors, religious leaders and politicians must rise to call these reckless few to order.\u201d",

The order of the Governor cannot be enforced for the following reasons:\n\n\u201c1. By the combined effect of the Trade Union Act and the Nigerian Constitution, Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have the unquestionable rights to participate in the peaceful warning strike and mass protests against further retrenchment of workers in the Kaduna State public service.\n\n\u201c2. The Miscellaneous Offences Act is not a state statute but a federal enactment. To that extent, if Governor El Rufai has evidence that Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have contravened any provisions of the Act he is required to lodge a complaint in any of the police stations in Kaduna State. The Governor lacks the power to declare any alleged offender wanted under the Act or any other law whatsoever.\n\n\u201c3. Furthermore, since Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders are entitled to the fundamental right of fair hearing including the presumption of innocence guaranteed by section 36 of the Constitution the Governor of Kaduna lacks the power to declare them wanted.\u201d\n\nFalana, therefore, called on the authorities of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies to ignore the \u201cillegal statement\u201d by Governor El Rufai.",

Italy, Belgium, Hungary and other nations already have started allowing outdoor dining, while drinking and eating indoors was allowed in Britain\u2019s pubs on Monday.\n\nEateries in France have been closed since the end of October, the longest time of any European country except Poland, where bars and restaurants reopened Saturday for outdoor service after being closed for seven months.\n\nSome French caf\u00e9 and restaurant owners have spent days preparing for Wednesday\u2019s milestone. The excitement is at risk of a dampening down: rain is forecast for large swaths of France, including Paris.\n\nThe government also has put serious limits on capacity in venues, with restaurants only allowed to fill their outdoor seating areas to only 50% of capacity and to put no more than six people at a table.\n\nOther rules to ensure social distancing apply elsewhere. Movie theaters must limit audiences to 35% of capacity. Museums must guarantee 8 square meters of space (86 square feet) per visitor.\n\nThe government plans to extend the curfew until 11 p.m. and to permit indoor dining at restaurants and bistros \u2013 and relax border rules for tourists \u2013 starting on June 9. The final phase of the three-stage reopening plan is scheduled for June 30, when the curfew will end and all other restrictions will be lifted, if health conditions allow.\n\nFrance has recorded more than 108,000 deaths due to COVID-19 since the start of the epidemic, among the highest tolls in Europe.
