          "title": "Buni, Malami move to block convention, governors rise against interim party chair",
          "text": "There are strong indications that the Yobe State Governor and Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, has intensified moves to prevent the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for February from holding.\n\nThe PUNCH on Tuesday gathered that Buni\u2019s moves had the backing of the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN; the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu and his Jigawa State Governor counterpart, Muhammad Badaru.\n\nIt was learnt that as part of the plot, Buni-led caretaker committee was not interested in February convention so that it could remain in office till the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nA party leader, who confided in one of our correspondents, said, \u201cBuni\u2019s panel is desperate to prevent the convention from holding because the Yobe governor has vice-presidential ambition. That is why the governor is foot-dragging on the national convention issue. In a matter of days, the caretaker committee will come up with an excuse that the convention cannot hold in February because of the lingering crises in some state. It is part of the delay tactics.\u201d\n\nIt was however gathered the majority of the governors had got wind of the plan of Buni and would move against him at their meeting today (Wednesday).\n\nIt was also learnt that the decision of APC leader, Bola Tinubu, to contest the presidential election had unsettled the camp of Buni.\n\nIt was gathered that if the governors insisted on holding the planned February convention, Buni and his backers would push for the consensus method to elect national officers in order to maintain control of the party ahead of the primaries.\n\nThree governors, Malami push consensus agenda to block Tinubu\n\nThis is just as The PUNCH learnt on Tuesday that the delay by the Buni committee in picking a date for the convention was also propelled by Buni\u2019s vice-presidential ambition which now makes it less likely if Tinubu emerges as the APC presidential candidate.\n\nBased on this development, the governors of the APC, who support Tinubu\u2019s ambition are already strategising on how to ensure that the convention holds as quickly as possible and in a transparent manner.\n\n\u201cIt is true that there is a crisis in several states. But I can tell you categorically that the delays in holding this convention are caused in part by Buni\u2019s ambition to be vice-president,\u201d said a member of the Buni committee, who is sympathetic to the governors.\n\nThe President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had on June 25, 2020 dissolved the National Working Committee of the APC led by former Governor Adams Oshiomhole due to a crisis that was caused by Oshiomhole\u2019s feud with his successor, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State.\n\nBased on pressure from some governors including Kebbi State Governor, Bagudu; Malami; Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and his Jigawa State counterpart, Muhammad Badaru, the President at a meeting of the National Executive Council of the party, dissolved the NWC and appointed Buni as the leader of a 13-member committee.\n\nThe mandate of the Buni-led committee was to organise a national convention within six months but the committee continued to foot-drag, meeting Buhari regularly for extensions.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are 14 in the committee, Buni is the one that takes all decisions. He continued to shift the date for reasons best known to him,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if the decision to delay the convention was not caused by the crisis in several states, the official said the crisis was indeed real but it was not enough to stall a national convention for so long.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is that Buni got very comfortable and powerful in this position. A governor who is busy in his home state ought not to have time to be sitting down in Abuja.\n\n\u201cFor the first six months, the committee achieved nothing apart from trying to convince governors of the Peoples Democratic Party to defect. So, that was how six months was spent when the core mandate of the committee was to organise a convention.\n\n\u201cThis same committee organised the frivolous Anambra primary that has now been discredited by the court. They now want to supervise the Ekiti and Osun governorship primaries.\u201d\n\nThe official further stated that the Buni committee had set up several sub-committees that had achieved nothing.\n\nHe said even the reconciliation committee led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu was just another avenue to waste more time.\n\n\u201cIn March 2021, Buni set up the Congress Strategy and Contact Committee headed by Badaru which was supposed to submit a report on zoning of the Presidential election and other matters. They said at the time that the convention would hold in June 2021. That matter has since been forgotten.\n\n\u201cBuni set up a reconciliation committee on October 11 but the committee did not start its job until two months later. Obviously, everything is just delay tactics. The truth is that Buni has become so powerful that he wants to be able to determine the Presidential candidate of the APC who will pick him as a running mate,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how Buni intended to achieve this, the official said the Yobe State governor and his backers that had succeeded in killing the idea of mandatory direct primaries and would ensure that both the chairman of the APC and the presidential candidate would emerge through consensus.\n\nHe said the consensus method would be used in edging out the likes of Tinubu who had a strong following in the party.\n\n\u201cWe are going to put our foot down and demand that a date for the convention is announced this week. If not, we will take the gloves off. We will no longer allow a tiny cabal in the APC to take us for a ride. Even President Buhari, who is not seeking office, is growing frustrated with these games,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhen contacted on the telephone, the spokesman for the Yobe State Governor, Mamman Mohammed, said the issue was a party affair not a Yobe State issue.\n\n\u201cWe are presently in Abuja and this issue is a party affair not an issue of Yobe State where the governor governs. We are speaking with your colleague here in Abuja,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the National Secretary of the Caretaker committee, John Akpanudoedehe, did not respond to a text message on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, efforts to get Governor Bagudu\u2019s media to react to the plot to foist consensus arrangement on the party and edged out Tinubu did not succeed.\n\nEven several calls and messages sent to his media aide, Yahaya Sarki, were not returned nor replied, as at the time of going to press.\n\nMalami doesn\u2019t hold any position in APC, plays no role, says media aide\n\nBut when asked about Malami\u2019s role in the APC crisis, the Spokesman for the AGF, Dr Umar Gwandu, said his principal was preoccupied with his duties as the AGF.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) is not talking politics but is proving his worth in the discharge of the responsibilities bestowed on him as the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\n\u201cHe is doing wonderfully well as the Attorney-General and not as a politician. Malami does not hold any office in the All Progressive Congress and plays no political role in the party.\u201d\n\nSomeone is manipulating convention not to hold \u2013 PGF DG\n\nMeanwhile, stakeholders of the APC have faulted the party\u2019s current leadership for exuding a body language that disrespects the earlier proposed February national convention.\n\nThis is as they said that the party\u2019s laxity in holding a convention is only a foretaste of the frictions that might hinder other critical milestones in the run-up to the 2023 elections.\n\nDirector-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Lukman, said this on Tuesday in Abuja when delivering the keynote address at the APC Stakeholders Summit themed \u2018Rebuilding the APC of our dreams\u2019.\n\nA distraught Lukman also faulted the idea of zoning, calling it a blast from the PDP years, which has done a great disservice to the quality of Nigeria\u2019s leadership for decades.\n\nHe also said the lapse in communication between the APC and Nigerians had given the opposing Peoples Democratic Party a voice in recent times. He faulted the Buni-led committee for leaving a communication gap that the opposition had exploited.\n\nSpeaking of the national convention, Lukman said, \u201cAll of us as members and leaders are looking forward to a situation where we will wake up one morning, and we\u2019ll be told that on so and so date and venue, the national convention of the party is going to take place. Unfortunately, we are wasting so much time.\n\n\u201cAs human beings, when we struggle to get water to drink, what it simply means is that we will not have the capacity to find food. So, if we are struggling for a critical organ of the party such as the National Convention to hold, then how are we going to manage contests that will produce candidates?\n\n\u201cThe danger signal is that we may end up having a convention that will not guarantee a healthy contest within the party. We need to get out of that. We think that February 5 will be the convention. Yet somebody just sat down somewhere and is manipulating it not to hold. And we are all taking it? We can\u2019t have a political party that disrespects decisions.\u201d\n\nThe DG also attributed the poor quality of leadership produced in the country to zoning, a system he faulted.\n\nLukman also said the poor communication among party members and the populace is the leading cause of the internal fever the APC is experiencing.\n\nHe took shots at the current National Secretary of the CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe, saying that the APC was suffering because it lacks a competent national secretary.\n\nLukman added, \u201cThe national secretary is a critical office. From our experience with the caretaker committee, part of our disasters is not having a competent secretary. I am not personalising it, but that is the reality. We need a competent secretary else the bureaucracy will be weak\u2014no organisation functions without an efficient bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWe are now struggling to hold a convention. At the last count, there were nine aspirants for the chairmanship. By yesterday morning, I saw another person, making it 10. There are more coming. I recall that in 2014, we didn\u2019t have that situation.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason was because meetings were taking place. So, leaders were able to consult and engage with one other and moderate the actions of everybody in the party. Now, because leaders have become overconfident, meetings are hardly taking place. It is now difficult to moderate the leaders\u2019 excesses and even the caretaker committee. We must appeal to our leaders to return to that mode of having meetings. And they don\u2019t need to expect agreement every time. This is what we need as a party.\u201d\n\nEfforts to make Akpanudoedehe respond to Lukman criticism did not succeed as he did not reply an SMS sent to him.\n\nTinubu promotes excellence, capable of becoming Nigeria\u2019s President \u2013 Abe\n\nMeanwhile, a former representative of the Rivers South-East Senatorial district in the National Assembly, Senator Magnus Abe has described Tinubu as a promoter of excellence, saying he is capable and qualified to become Nigeria\u2019s President in 2023.\n\nAbe said this during a breakfast meeting with journalist in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital on Tuesday.\n\nAbe added,\u201d The most important job of a leader is to pick people. If you look at the quality of people that Asiwaju picked and the way he promotes quality people in everything, they stand out.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that has kept Africa where it is , is that leaders prefer loyalty above capacity and competence. Asiwaju is one of few leaders in Africa who picks capacity and competence above loyalty and promotes excellence in every way.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Administration has said civil servants without proof of vaccination and negative coronavirus test results done within 72 hours will not be allowed to enter their offices as from next Monday.\n\nThis is coming after the Federal Government, through the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, asked state governors to enact and enforce vaccination mandates for local and state government workers.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Media and Strategic Communication, Abubakar Sani, said a circular by the FCTA Permanent Secretary, Olusade Adesola, had been sent to relevant agencies for enforcement.\n\nHe said the move was part of measures to curtail the spread of the deadly virus in the FCT.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018FCTA to bar unvaccinated staff, visitors from offices\u2019.\n\nIt read, \u201cAs part of efforts aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the FCT, all members of staff are required to show evidence of COVID-19 vaccination or present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within 72 hours, failure of which such members of staff will not be allowed into the office premises commencing from Monday, January 17, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn view of the fact that the FCTA premises are public buildings, all visitors and clients coming to do business are required to comply with this directive.\n\n\u201cA circular signed by the FCTA Permanent Secretary has been sent to the Executive Secretary of the Federal Capital Development Authority and all mandate secretaries, the Coordinator of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council and the Coordinator of the Satellite Towns Development Department, heads of all departments and FCTA agencies to officially inform them.\u201d\n\nHe warned that persistent non-compliance or refusal by staff to be vaccinated would be treated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Public Service Rules.\n\nSani, however, disclosed that to ensure strict compliance with the directive, the Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement and the Director of Security Services had been mandated to mount surveillance at all entry points.\n\nThe NPHDA, on Tuesday, via its official Facebook page, said Lagos, Ondo, Bayelsa and Edo states \u201chave joined other states to move at least eight steps backward since the start of the mass vaccination campaign in the country.\u201d\n\nThe agency also stated that the South-East, North-East and the South-South zones had contributed the least to the mass vaccination campaign.\n\nThe information came to the fore as our correspondent observed that Nigeria had continued to witness an increase in the death toll with a total of 15 deaths reported between January 7, 2022 and January 10, 2022.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the Federal Government, through the NPHCDA, had introduced mass vaccination campaigns in states in a bid to speed up the process in states.\n\nSome of the proposed mass vaccination sites listed included schools, markets and places of worship, among others.\n\nSince the commencement of the mass vaccination, the NPHCDA has kept track of the progress of each state.\n\nAs of January 11, 2022, the NPHCDA stated that governors of Nasarawa, Jigawa, Ogun, Oyo and Zamfara states were top performing as regards the issue of mass vaccination.\n\nIt, however, noted in its highlights, \u201cLagos, Ondo, Bayelsa and Edo have joined other states to move at least eight steps backward since the start of the vaccination campaign.\n\n\u201cThe South-East zone, North-East zone, South-South zone have contributed the lowest to the mass vaccination campaign at 2.7 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH reports that as of January 10, 2022, Nigeria had yet to vaccinate 10 per cent of the eligible population with the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. This is as the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals remains below five per cent.\n\nExperts have continued to advocate herd immunity amidst discoveries of new variants of COVID-19.\n\nThe nation is currently in the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control continues to predict more waves if the citizens continue to ignore public health measures and shun vaccination.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is within his right as a Nigerian to go for it. But for the purpose of further clarity, we see the move to visit the President as a troublemaking misstep purposely to create an impact that may unbalance the present drivers of the party, the progressive governor\u2019s forum and enlarge the fault lines already visible and to midwife a division within.\n\n\u201cThis attitude is uncalled for, particularly from any democrat that is worthy of being a member of an association and at a time the Nation is looking for peace.\n\nMoreover, It is important for us to set the record straight, that the presidential interest from any tribe other than from the IGBOS may take the nation into a deeper political trouble that may set the nation ablaze if care is not taking.\n\n\u201cThose who see Alhaji Abubakar Atiku\u2019s and Tinubu\u2019s interest as their \u201cRight\u201d obviously also believed that Igbo interest is a \u201cHope\u201d and we can from this stage imagine what calamity we have created for 250million of lives and families and how quickly we have destroyed the bridges made by southern governors for our common struggle and to the understanding of our people in the North and South that oneness amongst ourselves and within our diversity is more important than the interest of political brigands and their fair weather helpers.\n\n\u201cAs leaders of thought in the Southwest, we have taken inventory of conditions in our diversity and our findings convinced us that the fate of our vast people and ethnic nationalities across Nigeria can only be made well, if we rotate the office of the president amongst ourselves and in a uniform fashion. It is very important for leaders both in the South and North to put some sort of order in their feelings and form a new basis for their future actions to avoid taken 250 million of our people into near war scenarios.\n\n\u201cWe have looked in astonishment on all of our political and religious decisions so far, and as leaders and fathers, with a mixture of pride and apprehension, watch leaders achieve a scandalous and applauded fame in political tricks.\n\nWe therefore plead with leaders mostly in the south not to play the \u201cTraitor Role\u201d.\n\nWe have taken a position to support IGBO presidency come 2023, the declaration we have also made and we are not going to take it back.\n\n\u201cOn Igbo presidency we still stand.\u201d",

          "text": "UNICEF/NPC team at the meeting\n\nBy Peter Duru \u2013 Makurdi\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF in collaboration with the National Population Commission, NPC, have commenced sensitization campaign to scale up child birth registration in the 23 Local Government Areas, LGAs, of Benue state.\n\nAddressing the One-Day Stakeholders\u2019 Engagement with Religious, Traditional and Community Leaders from Guma, Gwer East, Gwer West and Makurdi Local Government Areas of Benue State towards Strengthened Collaboration, Partnership and Ownership for Improved Under-Five Birth Registration Service Delivery, Tuesday in Makurdi, the UNICEF Chief of Enugu Field Office, Dr. Ibrahim Conteh urged all hands to be on deck to improve child registration in the state.\n\nRepresented by Mr. victor Atuchukwu, the Child Protection Specialist, UNICEF Enugu Field Office, Dr. Conteh expressed concern at the low rate of under-five registration in the state noting that a birth registration from the National Population Commission, NPC, remained the passport of protection for the child.\n\nTo drive the process, Dr. Conteh said, \u201cthe NPC is coordinating and UNICEF is supporting the process to ensure that the mandate of the commission, as contained in the rights of the child is achieved by ensuring that every child in the country has a legal identity and a name which is a birth certificate in this instance.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the low births registration in Benue state, the Chief of Field Office said, \u201cfrom the available data on Benue state from the National Demographic Health Survey, NDHS, of 2018 only 39.1 percent of under-five children have their birth registered.\n\n\u201cAnd of that number only 16.9 percent of them have birth certificates, that is of the 39.1 percent that were registered.\n\n\u201cThe NPC on their own part also have to understand that even of the 39.1 percent that were registered, not all of them were registered with the commission, only 21.7 percent of the total 39.1 percent that registered, were registered with the NPC.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore a mandate for the NPC in Benue state to ensure that these numbers are increased and every child has a birth certificate. In the communities we have the Registrar, we have the Chief Registrar working at the Local Governments and the community levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for all hands to be on deck to ensure that the births of our under-five children are registered because of the inherent benefits.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the reaction elicited from the stakeholders at the meeting, Dr. Conteh said, \u201cfrom the meeting today we can see that the commitments have come, the change can only come from the people, it does not matter what the mandate is, especially when it has to come to getting the people understand and move away from the ignorance state of the importance of birth registration and them understanding the importance.\n\n\u201cSo from the meeting today and the responses we got you will understand that knowledge has been increased and especially when the commitment is coming from the people themselves.\n\n\u201cThink about it, we are a homogenous society, when we get information either from the traditional leaders or the paramount rulers we concur. Even if we are stubborn to the traditional leaders, when our pastors or religious leaders say it we listen to them. This includes the NPC from the side of the government.\n\n\u201cSo I see everybody coming together to work, not just for the data but we are talking child protection. A child that doesn\u2019t have a name which is an identity and the birth certificate from the NPC doesn\u2019t have any protection because that is actually the passport to protection for children.\n\n\u201cWe have today interacted with four LGAs which are Makurdi, Gwer West, Gwer East and Guma. The campaign will reach all the 23 LGAs of Benue state and we expect the same commitments.\n\n\u201cThrough this knowledge child birth registration will increase especially when we start linking things with the betterment and welfare of not just the children but the community.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that it is until the government knows the number of children that were given birth to, or the number of children that will be given birth to, following the birth registration records, certification and documentation, that they can start planning for schools and the number of desks that they will use; the number of vaccine for immunization and others that they will need.\u201d\n\nWhile cautioning that any birth registration done outside the NPC is illegal and not recognized by law, Dr. Conteh said that \u201cas provided in the Nigerian Constitution, according to the Births and Deaths Compulsory Registration Act Number 69 of 1992, registration of births and deaths is compulsory in all cases in Nigeria. The National Population Commission has the mandate and is responsible for registering this important event nationwide.\u201d\n\nIn his remark, the NPC Federal Commissioner in charge of Benue state, Mrs. Patricia Kupchi said the outcome of the state-wide sensitization would be a blessing to the children of the state.\n\nRepresented by the Benue state Director of the NPC, Mr. Stephen Tsemende, the Federal Commissioner commended the stakeholders for turning out in their numbers to participate in the advocacy explaining that the Commission was not just about conducting census alone, \u201cit is also our constitutional mandate among others to register the birth of under-five children.\n\n\u201cRegistering the birth of our children is just one out of the many responsibilities of NPC. We thank the stakeholders for heeding the call to attend the meeting. I assure you that at the end of the meeting, the perception of many would change about NPC. When you don\u2019t have knowledge, you can even ignore things that are for your benefit,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Benue state Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr. Joseph Ngbea who was represented by the Director of Public Health, Dr. Terna Kur commended UNICEF and NPC for the collaboration to drive the campaign stressing that the Ministry would collaborate with them to give improved healthcare services to the people of the state.\n\n\u201cWe are here to identify with UNICEF and NPC on the issues of birth registration. Birth registration is not new to many but we discovered that as time went on, birth registration dropped drastically. That\u2019s why we are here to discuss it.\n\n\u201cWe must register our births because it has a lot to do in improving the economy of the country. For us in the Ministry of Health, it is not new to work with traditional institution to deliver healthcare services in communities. We are going to be very supportive to this cause.\n\n\u201cWe have also been collaborating with the church to ensure that we get all the health needs of children to them and to ensure they are registered. We are going to be working with every stakeholder on this issue to ensure its success,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile responses from stakeholders at the meeting indicated that the people where ready to key into the advocacy.\n\nOne of the stakeholders and traditional ruler who is the District Head of Ankpa /Wadata, Chief Samuel Asema assured that he would mobilise all his subjects to ensure that all children\u2019s birth were registered.\n\nOn his part, Secretary of the NKST Church, Ama-Makurdi, Elder John Ayu assured that the church would lead the campaign to have the births of under-five children registered. He however urged the NPC to recruit more staff to man the local government offices to show commitment on their part and ensure speedy registration exercise.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable to have only four NPC staff manning the Makurdi office where you have records of many children being given birth to every day,\u201d he said.\n\nA youth from Aliade in Gwer East LGA, Mr. Gabriel Nakpa from NKST Church Aliade, promised to inform his pastor to fix a date and time for the youths to create awareness and tell the people about the importance of registering the birth of their children as well as the dangers of not registering them.\n\n\u201cFrom the information we have now, I can tell you that we owe our children that responsibility to ensure that their births are registered at the NPC and certificate issued to them because it is a right we cannot afford to deny them anymore.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We know that the government owns 40 percent of the distribution. The National grid is controlled from Osogbo and must receive enough energy to transmit power. Government has set out to rehabilitate the transmission grid and we are beginning to see results.\n\n\u201cOur national transmission has not increase from 5,000 Mega Watts but it has not dropped.

The Yandev to Makurdi transmission line will also be completed within six months,\u201d he assured.\n\nOn the Presidential Power Initiative, he said it was being implemented in partnership with the German Goverment and driven by Special Purpose Vehicle with the Minister of Finance as the board Chairman.\n\nAccording to him, under the project, the Federal Government had ordered 10 Power Transformers to be deployed all over the country which would boost electricity supply in the country.\n\nThe Power Minister who was accompanied by the Minister for State, Power, Mr. Goddy Agba explained that they were in the State to inspect the ongoing upgrade of the Joint Sub Stations from Kashibilla in Taraba state \u201cwhere there is a dam and power plant to Yandev in Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State which has been completed and already giving power to Takum, Wukari and its environs. The project\u2019s capacity is 40 Mega Watts but there are technical issues we are addressing.\u201d\n\nReceiving the delegation Governor Ortom commended the President Muhammadu Buhari for improving on Power distribution in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Power Ministry is committed to execution of projects under their purview.

We are going to ask the court to restrict them from implementing the law and the court will decide.\n\n\u201cThe first ground is that a dead man has no right under the law. Anybody that is dead has lost all the rights that he has.\n\n\u201cThe right of Obas that they are claiming that we are violating is not right because a dead man has no right again under the law.\n\n\u201cSecondly, what we are saying is that Obaship institution will is optional, we are not forcing anybody to come there, we are not saying they should not bury Obas, but what we are opposing, if you follow, our argument is that how can they now say Christians and Muslims should come and be burying Obas, traditional heads? If there is anything that they don\u2019t want during their burials, they should say, but traditionalists must be the ones to bury Obas, not Christians.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they say that Christians or Muslims should be the ones to install the monarchs? They are not saying this. The governor even said without prejudice to the rights of traditionalists under customary law.

The Liverpool forward cut an isolated figure up front, starved of service and the quality around him to have an influence.\n\nNigeria fired German coach Gernot Rohr in December after an unimpressive World Cup qualifying campaign and put former national star Augustine Eguavoen in temporary charge.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEguavoen\u2019s squad was without forwards Victor Osimhen, Emmanuel Dennis, and Odion Ighalo for a variety of reasons, but the team started their campaign well against Mohamed Salah-captained Egypt.\n\nProlific Liverpool scorer Salah hardly touched the ball and had only one chance, late in the second half, to equalise.\n\nA cagey opening half controlled by Nigeria sprang to life on 26 minutes when winger Moses Simon got behind the Egypt defence and fired into the side netting from a difficult angle.\n\nSimon played a major role when the Super Eagles took the lead four minutes later at the 30,000-capacity Stade Roumde Adjia in the north-western city of Garoua.\n\nHis cross was only partially cleared by Ahmed Hegazy and Nigerian Joseph Aribo nodded the ball into the path of Iheanacho who hammered a half-volley past goalkeeper Mohamed Elshenawy.\n\nIheanacho almost set up a second goal for Nigeria before half-time, but his pass to Taiwo Awoniyi was just too strong and Elshenawy dashed off his line to gather the ball.\n\nEgypt nearly fell further behind a couple of minutes into the second half when Elshenawy got his hands to an Awoniyi header and the ball came back into play off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nSimon\u2019s speed was a constant threat on the left, while Nigeria goalkeeper Maduka Okoye was a mere spectator with Egypt unable to mount pressure.\n\nNIGERIA: Maduka Okoye, Ola Aina, Kenneth Omeruo (Semi Ajayi 79\u2019), William Troost-Ekong, Zaidu Sanusi, Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo, Moses Simon (Alex Iwobi 90+1\u2019), Taiwo Awoniyi (Umar Sadiq 72\u2019), Samuel Chukwueze (Chidera Ejuke 72\u2019), Kelechi Iheanacho (Kelechi Nwakali 80\u2019)",

          "title": "Despite ban, crypto will shake digital currency space",
          "text": "On February 5, last year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions and desist from transacting with entities engaging in crypto. Despite the CBN\u2019s order, which has been voided by a court ruling, no official pronouncement has been made, but trade in crypto continues to flourish. LUCAS AJANAKU reports that the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria will further deepen the global trade in the country.\n\nOstensibly as official reaction to the booming trade in crypto, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) first clamped down on traders and financial institutions that were facilitating the trade. It later launched its version it called e-Naira.\n\nCrypto and eNaira are digital or virtual currencies and are mediums of exchange but are not regular money. While the former is not issued or backed by the Federal Government or any other government or central bank, the latter is.\n\nBut in the years ahead, the crypto world will continue to see infrastructure development, proliferation of protocols, expansion of the metaverse, evolution of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as increased regulation, according to Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of major digital asset investment firm Grayscale.\n\nIn a letter to investors, the CEO took a moment to look back, stating that \u201cit is remarkable where we are today compared to 12 months ago\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCrypto and Web3 are seeing increased attention and acceptance by the media, regulators, legacy financial institutions, and world leaders. Therefore, crypto is continually increasing its footprint and becoming \u201cfurther woven into the global economy,\u201d Sonnenshein said.\n\nAs for his look into the future of crypto, the CEO said he is focused on \u201cthe big picture,\u201d listing five key trends to watch this year and beyond.\n\nThe first is crypto infrastructure development. The digital economy requires the tools and services that facilitate access to and usage of crypto, which is why crypto infrastructure will continue to grow. This includes exchanges, wallets, and analytics software.\n\n\u201cAs the crypto economy and existing financial markets become increasingly intertwined, these are likely to provide some of the most compelling long-term investment opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the year, more protocols than ever before will be witnessed.\n\nThe increase in the number of different crypto protocols is \u201cstaggering, \u201cand it is not slowing down, finds the CEO.\n\n\u201cSorting through these protocols to separate the wheat from the chaff continues to be challenging, requiring deep knowledge of both the technology and the marketplace,\u201d he added.\n\nExpansion of Web3 and the metaverse will also play a significant impact in crypto adoption and trading.\n\nThe Web2 experience is defined by large centralised corporations, with the users being the product and the means of revenue generation, Sonnenshein said. On the other hand, Web3, which, according to the CEO, includes the metaverse, shows opportunities for a digital future where the users control their data and digital footprint in all \u201cthe focal points of societal engagement,\u201d such as commerce, gaming, entertainment, news, and social networks. \u201cWeb3 flips the script and empowers users in a revolutionary way,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the NFT\u2019s current iteration is limited, mostly to digital art \u2013 however, this will change as they continue to evolve through the years into \u201cmore sophisticated\u201d use cases. This will especially be seen in areas such as authenticity, provenance, and ownership, as well as across sectors, including fashion, music, gaming, real estate, and ticketing.\n\n\u201cThe public discourse and momentum around NFTs demonstrates the material value of digital verification.\u201d\n\nNew regulation and policies are expected in this sphere of digital human endeavor. Grayscale finds that increased regulation is both inevitable and beneficial. Sonnenshein argues that we\u2019ve never before seen regulators and policymakers engaged and articulate about the crypto ecosystem as they are now.\n\n\u201cThis enables the conversation to shift to how these new technologies \u2013 when provided with the appropriate regulatory frameworks \u2013 can flourish, keeping crypto companies in the United States, and setting a global standard for crypto regulation.\u201d\n\nGoing back to the CEO\u2019s comment on how far the industry came in just a year, he noted that it\u2019s easy to forget that \u2018we are still in the early days \u2013 and this is the most exciting part about crypto\u2019.\n\nLosing the sight of this early age, Sonnenshein said \u201cleads many to make predictions that are premature or unfounded.\u201d For instance, he said digital assets and/or the metaverse will not replace the physical world or traditional asset classes \u2013 but will augment them, stating.\n\n\u201cWhile the path of the digital economy is relatively unknown, our reality is increasingly a fusion of the analog and digital worlds,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe All Progress Congress (APC) national leader and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said he has told President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to vie for the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nHe said as a democrat, President Buhari did not stop him from attempting to pursuing his life-long ambition.\n\nThe party chieftain said this while responding to questions from State House Correspondents after he met the president in his office at the presidential villa, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAsked if he had informed Buhari of his ambition, the APC chieftain said: \u201cI will answer that with categorical yes. I\u2019ve informed the president of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people will I consult. You will soon hear, all you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You\u2019ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr. President of my ambition, you don\u2019t expect more answers than that.\u201d\n\nOn the president\u2019s response, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s our business. He is a democrat. He didn\u2019t ask me to stop. He didn\u2019t ask me not to attempt and pursue my ambition, it\u2019s a lifelong ambition. So, why do you expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation, and you must adopt the principles and the values and the virtues of democracy. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHe declined to comment on what a race for the APC ticket between him and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo whose support groups have been mobilising for his candidacy would look like.\n\nAccording to him, with what he did in Lagos as governor, he has the capacity to rule Nigeria.\n\nOn Osinbajo\u2019s potential ambition, Tinubu maintained that he would not discuss any individual.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve have done that with commitment and unyielding\u2026 you know, in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cYou know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil we were producing when we first came in and what it is today. We cannot even\u2026 at the time we came in, we did not pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line. Today, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan, you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State on the aggressive pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads, the carnage of dying on motor vehicles is reducing except you know, lack of compliance with a lot of Nigerian drivers and VIOs. Let us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked why he would not remain a kingmaker rather than being the king, he said there was nothing that stops a kingmaker from becoming the king unless he has committed murder.\n\n\u201cAbout the cap of king maker. I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception.\u201d\n\nOn the direct primaries and the convention, he said: \u201cFirst of all, the National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review and review again. Whatever they come up with as electoral amendment is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively. The great roadmap to success is the ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So, to me, the electoral amendment point, we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it rigorously.\u201d\n\nOn the ruling party\u2019s convention, he said: \u201cIt is certain that we are going to get it.\u201d\n\nAsked when he responded: \u201cOh, well\u2026 I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the party. And the president is the leader of the party. So, expect convention, maybe if that\u2019s added to your own anxiety, or the other party\u2019s anxiety, it\u2019s is good for us. We get it and we\u2019ll get it done properly.\u201d\n\nOn the purpose of his visit, Tinubu said he came to see the President on general issues concerning Nigeria, including the ruling political party, security issues, the achievement and the New Year Agenda.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nSouth\u2013South leader, Chief Edwin Clark has reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Channels Television interview where he again rejected the clamour for state police as a solution to worsening security situation in the country.\n\nThe president had said: \u201cState police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tiers of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Let the people in local government tell you the truth; the fight between local governments and the governor.\u201d\n\nBut Clark, a former minister of information and leader of Pan Niger Delta Delta Forum (PANDEF) said Buhari was also guilty of the excuse that governors would misuse state police. He alleged that the current administration was also using the police to persecute perceived political opponents, thereby undermining the National Assembly and obstructing free speeches.\n\nHe said it was unconstitutional and authoritative for Mr. president to say that state police, which was even recommended by the Governor El-Rufai Committee as one of its items under devolution of power to be transferred from the Executive List in Schedule 1 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, to Schedule II of the Concurrent List, should be discarded.\n\nHe therefore urged President Buhari to give in to the demands of allowing the creation of state police.\n\nHe stated this in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, entitled, \u201dMajority of Nigerians believe in state police because it is one cardinal points or one of the ingredients in a federal system of government.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said the truth and not lies remain essential in running a democratic government and that there was the need for proper guidance, survival and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cMr President dismissed the call for state police in the country. He said that state police was not an option, that governors will misuse it. He gave an unrelated instance of the relationship between state governors and local governments, that there is no functional local government in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile the president is right that no local government in this country truly functions as provided by the constitution, not even the joint account under which state governments receive monies on behalf of the local governments, because the accounts are fully controlled by the state governors, it is not enough to dismiss the demand for state police.\n\n\u201cIt may be necessary to refer to some Sections of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution. Section 214 (1) says: There shall be a police force for Nigeria, which shall be known as the Nigerian Police force, and subject to the provisions of this section no other police shall be established for the federation or any part thereof.\n\n\u201cAnd Section 215 (4) says subject to the provisions of this section, the governor of a state or such commissioner of the government of the state as he may authorise in that behalf, may give to the commissioner of police of that state such lawful directions with respect to the maintenance and securing of public safety and public order within the state as he may consider necessary, and the commissioner of police shall comply with those directions or cause them to be complied with provided that before carrying out any such directions under the foregoing provisions of this subsection the commissioner of police may request that the matter be referred to the president or such minister of the government of the federation as may be authorised in that behalf by the President for his directions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI humbly submit that the above Section 214 (1), does not portray tenets of a federal system of government, but a unitary form of government. Hence the 1999 Constitution is rejected by democratic Nigerians who believe in a federal system of government. In a similar manner, Section 215 (4), does not really contain the ingredients of a federal system of government. As I stated in my recent interview, state p oleic is a popular agitation by Nigerians and was robustly discussed and agreed upon during the 2014 National Conference.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has advised members of the National Assembly, particularly members of House of Representatives, to drop their proposed bill meant to outlaw strikes and other industrial actions, particularly by health care workers under the umbrella of Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU).\n\nA House of Representatives member from Enugu State, Simon Atige, had championed a bill entitled: \u2018An Act to amend the Trade Disputes Act, cap T8, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, meant to prohibit medical practitioners in the employment of federal, state and local governments in the \u2018essential service\u2019 sectors, from embarking on strikes.\n\nThe bill was also meant to accelerate administrative and judicial proceedings in the determination of trade disputes involving them and related matters.\n\nNLC said the move was a deliberate attempt to gag the workers and legally weaken their strength, so they can loose legal backing to pursue their legitimate rights which mostly come from strike and other industrial actions, and they won\u2019t accept it.\n\nNLC President, Ayuba Wabba, who addressed journalists in Abuja, on the proposed bill, said Nigerian workers won\u2019t accept the bill, and would use all available means and strength to stop it.\n\nWabba said the proposed bill was an outright violation of fundamental human rights of workers, and also a violation of some sections of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, particularly on the Freedom of Association which Nigeria is a signatory to.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe NLC president disagreed with the plan to categorise health care workers under JOHESU as \u2018essential\u2019 service providers by the bill, hence they won\u2019t be entitled to strike. He, thereby, made reference to some sections of the ILO document particularly on Freedom of Association which only recognised air traffic controllers as essential service workers.\n\nWabba said: \u201cCompilation 769 of the ILO treaty stated clearly that strikes aimed at increase in wages and payment of wage arrears falls within the scope of legitimacy of trade union activities.\n\n\u201cAlso, compilation 751 stated that the right of workers to strike constitute a fundamental human rights of workers and their organisation, especially unions. Besides, strikes are used as means of defending the economy, social rights and interests of workers.\u201d\n\nHe, however, promised that NLC won\u2019t be confrontational in its approach against the lawmakers, rather it would adopt the option of lobbying and other means to pacify the lawmakers, and properly educate them on the dangers of their steps and the need to retrace the steps for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cThis move by lawmakers is laughable and a display of ignorance of the ILO conventions. Obviously, those proposing this law against strike by health workers are not aware of the ILO conventions, hence they are taking the wrong steps. Nigeria, through the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, is aware of the ILO conventions, and often provide reports on the compliance to the ILO authorities, periodically.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022AGF, BPP back Bala-Usman\n\n\u2022President orders conclusion of procurement process within 60 days\n\nEromosele Abiodun\n\nThe battle by INTELS Nigeria Limited to retain its service boat contract in the pilotage district of Lagos, Warri, Bonny, Port-Harcourt and Calabar, which expired on August 8, 2020, has met a dead end with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cancellation of the January 2021 directive to restore the contract.\n\nTHISDAY reliably gathered that the president took the decision following advice from the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Director General Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), and Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC), that unanimously advised the president against the restoration of the contract.\n\nThe development was seen as major victory for the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala-Usman whose alleged sin was failing to honour a presidential directive on the said contract.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi had listed failure to honour a presidential directive on the restoration of INTELS pilotage contract as terms of reference for the panel of enquiry set up to probe the NPA.\n\nThis was despite Bala-Usman\u2019s explanation that the president had withdrawn the directive pending further advice from the Attorney- General of the Federation and the Bureau of Public Procurement(BPP).\n\nThe terms of reference read: \u201cExamine and investigate issues leading to the termination of pilotage other contracts of NPA and confirm compliance with the terms of the respective contracts, court ruling and presidential directive.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter addressed to the AGF and the Minister of Transportation, with reference number: SH/COS/23/A/229, dated January 7, 2022, and singed by the Chief of Staff (COS) to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, seen by THISDAY, the president directed that the procurement process initiated by the procuring entity, NPA, that was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Transportation be forwarded immediately to the BPP for action.\n\nThe COS in the letter stated: \u201cThe president has also directed that upon receipt of the No-objection approval from the BPP, a memorandum be presented by the Ministry of Transportation to the Federal Executive Council for consideration, that the Ministry of Transportation should ensure that the process is concluded within 60 days of the president\u2019s directive to avoid further loss of revenue by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat NPA should ensure that the sanctity of the agreements with respect to Onne 4 (Berths 9, 10 & 11) be maintained, as there is no subsisting contract with INTELS for their utilisation.\u201d\n\nBuhari also directed the AGF to ensure quick determination of the cases in court in view of their economic importance, stressing that the above set of directives prior approval dated January 22, 2021 granted on the matter.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Buhari decided to act after reading the submissions of both the AGF and BPP who expressly warned of the danger of further litigations if the pilotage contract is restored.\n\nThe AGF had two months ago written to the president after a review of submissions by the NPA and INTELS.\n\nIn the letter dated November 18, 2021, with reference MJ/DSD/23/VII, seen by THISDAY, the AGF had stated that the NPA neither suspended nor terminated any of its contracts with INTELS, \u201cwhich therefore obviates the need for any restoration.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is certainty in the duration of the contract and the position of the law remains clear that a written contract freely entered into by the parties is binding on them. \u201cAccordingly, the contract for Managing Agent awarded to Messrs INTELS in 2007 validly came to an end and extinguished pursuant to the terms of agreement between the parties, which specified an end date of August 2020. The agreement did not provide for any further extension of the contract in favour of INTELS.\n\n\u201cIt is also to be noted that NPA pursuant to the expiration of the contract, kick-started the procurement process to appoint another managing agent in order to forestall any break in the service being rendered.\n\n\u201cNPA submitted that it concluded the tender/bidding process and forwarded the result to the Minister of Transportation for same to be presented for FEC\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nINTELS, the AGF added, resorted to litigation to frustrate the conclusion of the procurement process based on its grievance on a different subject-matter.\n\nThe development, the AGF added, had created a vacuum in the provision of this critical service in the maritime sector with its attendant loss of revenue from service boat operation to the federal government.\n\nThe AGF also stressed that the approval granted by the president in January last year, which Bala-Usman was said to have disobeyed, was based on insufficient information at the time.\n\nThe purported termination, he concluded, could not have occurred since the contract came to an end in 2020 based on the agreement by the parties.\n\nIn the same vein, the BPP denounced claims by the Ministry of Transportation and urged the president not to restore the contract to avoid further litigation.\n\nThe BPP in a letter addressed to the COS to the president, with reference, BPP/DG/2021/007, dated March 9, 2021, had stated that the decision by the NPA to initiate a procurement process in anticipation of the expiration of the contract for boat operation managing agent was in order.\n\nThe BPP in the letter signed by its Director General, Mamman Ahmadu, concluded that, \u201cThere is a compelling need to ensure that contractors and service providers do not take undue advantage of government agencies and do not obtain contracts from government agencies through the court rooms.\n\n\u201cThe correct procedure is that contracts should be won through a proper procurement process that complies with the provisions of the PPA, 2007. Furthermore, there is need to avoid the kind of monopoly currently enjoyed by Messrs INTELS which has cascaded into entitlement mentality being demonstrated by the firm.\n\n\u201cAlso, monopoly will inevitably result in charging a higher price to the consumer/client than what is obtainable from a competitive market, thereby eroding value for money.\u201d\n\nThe NPA and INTELS have since 2020 disagreed over the renewal of the pilotage or boat service contract.\n\nThe Nigerian Ports Authority insisted that the 10 years contract with INTELS expired on August 8, 2020, after which it initiated procurement processes for the contract.\n\nThe NPA thereafter submitted the outcome of the procurement process, which the Authority says INTELS participated in, to the Minister who, rather than forward same to BPP, sought the approval of the President to restore the contract to INTELS. This situation has brought the boat pilotage service operations to a standstill for about 16 months, with attendant revenue losses to the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Transparency Nigeria Group has urged the Central Bank of Nigeria to immediately dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of WEMA Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of Wema Bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds. \u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta received billions from Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, Ocean Trust moved N1.5billion from its 0702892574 Wema Bank account to another 0122613238 account within Wema Bank.\n\nThe description for the transaction was labelled \u201cClosure proceeds\u201d.\n\nA week after on January 9, N800million was transferred to the same bank account.\n\nOn January 16, 2019, N500million was also transferred to the same account. N1.5 billion, N800 million, and N500 million were transferred to the 0122613238 Ocean Trust account on February 1, February 8 and February 15 in 2019, respectively.\n\nThe same account got N1.5 billion on March 4, while N800 million and N500 million were transferred on March 11 and 18, 2019.\n\nOn April 3, the account received yet another N1.5billion while N800million was credited to it on April 10 and another N500million on April 17.\n\nN1.5 billion was moved to the account on May 3 while N600million and N500million were credited to the account on May 10 and May 17 respectively.\n\nOn June 3, N1.5billion was transferred to the Ocean Trust account with another N600million on June 10 and another N500million on June 17.",

          "title": "OBITUARY: Ernest Shonekan, the technocrat who 'stabilised' Nigeria after June 12 annulment",
          "text": "While June 12 and its aftermath remains a brackish pit in the ocean of Nigeria\u2019s history, Ernest Shonekan is widely credited as the man who brought \u201cstability\u201d at a time of dire political uncertainty.\n\nA glance at the short but illustrious gallery of Nigeria\u2019s leaders will show leaders in military regalia, alongside a handful of men in starched traditional attire. But right at the centre of these two sets of leaders is solemn-looking Shonekan, who held power, albeit briefly, after Ibrahim Babangida, former head of state, \u201cstepped aside\u201d after the June 12 annulment.\n\nShonekan died on Tuesday at the age of 85 and with the tributes that have continued to pour in in his honour, his short stint at the helm of the country\u2019s affairs leads the conversations around what many term a well-lived life.\n\nBeyond his transient regime as Nigeria\u2019s interim head of state, Shonekan was a British-trained lawyer and industrialist who headed vast Nigerian conglomerates. He founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), a private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group that promotes sustainable growth and the development of the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFROM LAGOS TO BRITAIN\n\nShonekan was born on May 9, 1936, in Lagos to a civil servant father who originated from Abeokuta. He got his earlier education at the CMS Grammar School and Igbobi College before getting a law degree from the University of London. He later attended the Harvard Business School.\n\nIn 1964, Shonekan was employed by the United Africa Company of Nigeria, at the time a subsidiary of the United Africa Company, which had a reputation dating back to the British colonial days. A quick rise through the ranks saw him land a place on the board of directors at the age of 40. He was made chairman and managing director in 1980. He was given the title of Abese of Egbaland in 1981.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROLE IN JUNE 12 CRISIS\n\nOn January 2, 1993, Babangida appointed Shonekan as the head of the transitional council that was created to be the initial stage of the military regime\u2019s eventual handover to a civilian government that should have emerged from the presidential election later that year.\n\nHowever, June 12, 1993 came and the election rolled by and Babangida annulled the results after Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) was said to have taken a significant lead over his opponent, Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC). A crisis ensued with Abiola and his supporters pushing for a declaration of victory.\n\nBabangida, instead, stepped aside on August 27, 1993, but not before he signed a decree establishing the interim national government, which saw Shonekan become the interim head of state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEIGHTY-THREE DAYS IN OFFICE\n\nShonekan became the Nigerian head of state with the shortest term in office after he was ousted by Sani Abacha, his defence minister, on November 17, 1993. He spent just 83 days as the head of the Nigerian government. His interim government was, however, largely unpopular with the people despite naming Abiola as his vice-president.\n\nUnder his brief leadership, the strident economic policies of his predecessor began degrading, which many have linked to the uncertain political terrain following the June 12 annulment.\n\nBefore settling and building a structure to create impact, he was deposed in a coup headed by Abacha.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelivering his resignation address on November 17, 1993, Shonekan said the national government under his watch \u201ctried very hard to bring honour to government\u201d and took steps to tackle corruption and indiscipline.\n\nMeanwhile, days before his resignation, on November 10, 1993, a high court ruled that the interim government was \u201cillegal\u201d on the basis that Shonekan\u2019s appointment was signed after Babangida \u201cstepped aside\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOUT OF OFFICE AND INTO NESG\n\nAfter leaving office in 1993, with the private sector connections he built in his years at UAC, he founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe private sector think-tank has worked with the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) to help promote economic cooperation between sub-nationals and businesses in the quest to create jobs.\n\nIn 2019, the group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Universities Commission (NUC) for an academia-industry collaboration to revitalise Nigeria\u2019s higher education system.\n\nTHE NATIONALIST WHO BELIEVED YOUTHS CAN TRANSFORM NIGERIA\n\nAside from other positions he has held, including as chairman of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Shonekan has not minced words about his belief in Nigeria\u2019s potential for greatness.\n\nSpeaking during the Democracy Day celebration in May 2014, he had expressed optimism about Nigeria\u2019s \u201cbright future\u201d, which he believed could be achieved by promoting peace and supporting the youth population.\n\n\u201cI believe that the future will be bright if there is peace. Without peace, there can\u2019t be any progress in the country. So, we need to have peace in the country. And if we have to have peace, each of us must contribute our quota towards it,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cSo, I appeal to everybody that they should sheathe their swords and let\u2019s concentrate on growing the economy further and create jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019re thinking in terms of the youths because the youths constitute about 50 percent of the total population at the moment \u2014 that\u2019s a lot.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to create jobs; we have to make them happy. If we\u2019re able to get each of them them to do a little bit to contribute to the economy, this country will be a better place and it will be very difficult for any country to beat Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFrom past leaders to lawmakers and political stakeholders, one message cuts across board on how Shonekan will be remembered \u2014 stability.\n\nWhile President Muhammadu Buhari described Shonekan as \u201ca peacemaker\u201d who steered Nigeria through \u201ca delicate time when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking\u201d, for former President Goodluck Jonathan, he was \u201ca bridge builder who stepped in to lead at a very difficult time\u201d.",

          "title": "Unchecked ambition, lax regulations: The genesis of predatory digital lenders in Nigeria",
          "text": "Ebuka Anyaeji thought he had seen it all, so when he first received a threat message about being a guarantor to a debtor on the run, he dismissed it as a joke, a message sent by an angry creditor to the wrong phone number. But the messages (WhatsApp and text) kept coming in; then Anyaeji found out his friends were also getting the same.\n\nLater on, the harassment moved from messages to phone calls\u2014real-time and pre-recorded calls. The content of the messages transitioned from just informing him that someone was owing the creditor money to threatening to embarrass him if he didn\u2019t get the defaulting debtor in question to pay.\n\n\u201cThe messages typically went along this line: \u2018This person is owing us money, and you\u2019re one of his guarantors. Tell him to pay or else we\u2019ll embarrass both of you\u2019,\u201d Anyaeji told TechCabal. \u201cIn some instances, they mentioned the amount of money owed, which was surprisingly low\u2014about \u20a610,000 ($17.8) or \u20a630,000 ($53.6)\u2014or in other cases they just referred to the debtor as a chronic debtor or fraudulent individual.\u201d\n\nOut of the numerous messages he\u2019s gotten, there\u2019s been only one occasion where he knew the debtor being referred to\u2014a university mate. What did he do about this case? He didn\u2019t bother informing the person, because they weren\u2019t close.\n\nA screenshot of Anyaeji\u2019s Whatsapp chat.\n\nFor Anyaeji, who now occasionally dishes out witty responses to the senders of these messages just for fun, he wonders why the debt collection practices of digital lenders like Soko Loan, LCash, 9Jacash among others use shaming tactics and, more importantly, whether this new trend would continue unchecked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this\n\nThere is no doubt that Africans have embraced taking loans through digital-lending apps. They are discreet, quick to access, and require no collateral. But this also means lenders who use the repayment habits of users to gauge their creditworthiness\u2014and never physically meet their customers\u2014often struggle with loan repayment.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been like this in Nigeria. Loans were primarily issued out by traditional banks, who rarely ever gave out loans without the backing of collateral or guarantors.\n\nIn the case of a loan default, before it ever gets to the point where a defaulting debtor\u2019s collateral is seized, there are a number of checks put in place. First, loans are given only after credit checks have been run and the account relationship manager can vouch for a potential borrower. When a borrower defaults, the account relationship manager first reaches out to the lender to find out the reason, and even visits to confirm. Guarantors and referees are also contacted, if need be.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties are open and transparent, penalty charges don\u2019t come in yet. Until when they\u2019re past due obligations, which is typically over 90 days,\u201d an employee of a Nigerian bank, who spoke under anonymity, told TechCabal.\n\nOftentimes, while the account officer is following up with the defaulting customer, the monitoring team and even bank directors can also check up on the defaulting customer. The conversations typically revolve around ascertaining the repayment ability of the customer, restructuring the loan to extend the tenure and possibly waiving off penalty charges.\n\nIf all efforts to reach a reasonable agreement or recover the debt fail, the bank reverts to possessing the item\u2014usually a house or car\u2014used as collateral. This is a last resort that the bank isn\u2019t keen on exercising, another banker told TechCabal. \u201cWe detest having to possess people\u2019s lands or houses, which serve as collateral; the bank is not into real estate,\u201d he said.\n\nHow did lending apps come into the picture?\n\nFor a long time, Nigerian banks preferred to lend to businesses and not individuals. This led to the rise of new lenders like Carbon (formerly Paylater), Renmoney, and Branch that have filled the gap by offering quick loans through smartphone apps.\n\nTemi Sodipo, a credit risk analyst recalls the early days when there were only a few prominent Nigerian digital lenders like Renmoney and Paylater. But, as the years went by, new digital lenders popped up at different corners. People were at first skeptical but, over time, consumer confidence grew.\n\n\u201cI remember in late 2017 when we disbursed \u20a61 billion ($1.8m) in loans at Renmoney, we had a party to celebrate. In early 2019, when we issued \u20a64 billion ($7.3m) loans, it was just a normal month,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more digital lenders coming into the space, Sodipo believes that, despite the fact that many claim they\u2019re getting more people financially included, most digital lenders serve the same set of people because the terms for accessing the loans are similar. The terms include a six-month-long bank statement, verifiable government ID, employment letter, or work email verification.\n\nHe believes this has created an avenue for a few ambitious players who wanted a slice of the market to become lax with their rules. Some digital lenders even started giving out loans to people with bad ratings on credit bureau\u2014an obvious red flag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why they turn to desperate debt collection measures as they contend with a high rate of default. It\u2019s simply bad underwriting and not paying attention to basic credit risk principles,\u201d Sodipo said.\n\nCommercial banks also started dishing out instant loans\n\nIn 2020, at least half of the 22 existing Nigerian commercial banks started offering instant loan products without collaterals, something that was unheard of years ago. What was the driver of this move? A new directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN announced an increase in the required minimum Loan-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of commercial banks to 60% from 57.64%. At the end of September, it further increased the LDR to 65%. LDR stipulates the volume of loans a bank must give out as a percentage of its total deposit. In the case of 65% LDR, it meant that if, for instance, a bank has \u20a6100 billion of customer deposits, it must have at least \u20a665 billion issued as loans. The increase was done to encourage commercial banks to issue more loans to individuals and businesses in order to stimulate the economy.\n\nTo avoid the sanctions that came with not meeting the LDR, these commercial banks began offering instant loan products without collaterals at risk of high repayment default rate. When debtors defaulted, the banks, however, unlike digital lenders, responded differently to the defaults.\n\nA source familiar with this incident told TechCabal that, unlike the digital lenders, these big commercial banks can afford to introduce these types of loans and make a loss on them, considering that they make tens and hundreds of billions of naira in profit.\n\nIn addition to being able to absorb the loss, the CBN issued a directive\u2014the Global Standing Instructions (GSI) policy\u2014that gave banks the right to deduct the amount owed from the bank account of the loan defaulters in other banks, in order to reduce the amount of non-performing loans\u2014a move that reduced the chances of defaulting customers owing while having money with other banks.\n\nOptions available to digital lenders\n\nCurrently, digital lenders don\u2019t have the right to debit the accounts of loan defaulters in other banks via GSI, so they rely on automated card debits, repayment reminders, and reporting customers to the credit bureau as a last resort. But do these methods work?\n\nJulian Flosbach, CEO of BFree, an ethical debt recovery company, believes they do if they consider the reasons customers default as well as their current financial situation. According to flosbach a majority of borrowers default because they lose their jobs, their business fails, or due to health emergencies that change the financial affordability of customers. He believes that assessing the new financial abilities of a customer and offering new repayments plans via convenient communication channels can then increase the repayment rates from these customers significantly.\n\nAn employee at a digital lending company explained that reporting to the credit bureau could be effective at times. She cited a case of a defaulting debtor whose application visa was denied because he failed to repay his loan for over a year. Credit checks are a prerequisite for issuing visas in some countries.\n\nShe also affirms Sodipo\u2019s point about an influx of lenders with lax rules by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s typically companies not registered with the credit bureau that use unethical debt collection practices.\u201d\n\nSlow and steady doesn\u2019t win this race\n\nIt\u2019s clear that digital lenders involved in unethical debt collection practices do so because of their unchecked ambition and the convenience of operating outside the law.\n\nFortunately, a number of governing bodies are beginning to do something about these digital lenders. In August 2021, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine (a questionable small amount) on Soko Lending Company, one of the digital lenders which repeatedly contacted Anyaeji.\n\nA few months later, in October, Google took down a number of predatory loan apps from its Play Store for violating its policies. Despite these actions, the pace of the response from Nigerian regulators is slow when compared to Kenya, where in December a new law was put in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nIf victims like Anyaeji and his friends would ever be free from the disturbance and intimidation from these predatory digital lenders, Nigeria\u2019s regulators would have to increase the pace of their response.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA.

I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day\n\nOluwanifemi, here\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCrypto at AFCON\n\nTouch and Pay (TAP)\u2019s Cowry card\n\nCrypto ads at AFCON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Sky Sports\n\nThe African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2022 kicked off on Sunday, January 9, in Cameroon. Although there have been multiple postponements, anticipation didn\u2019t quite wane. So far, four matches have been played, and many more are to come before the finale on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about sports, but I\u2019ve grown a liking for football, and I\u2019ve been conveniently drawn to foreign leagues, especially the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Following the buzz around AFCON, I asked Emmanuel Paul if players were on an international break. \u201cApparently not,\u201d he replied.\n\nAfrica is a great exporter of talents, and this includes football. This means some foreign clubs would have to miss their players for some weeks. Well, my real worry was Chelsea having Kepa Arrizabalaga man the nets for its upcoming major matches\ud83d\ude10, instead of Mendy, who is off to make Senegal proud. Anyways, the entire situation was surprising since AFCON is one of the world\u2019s major continental tournaments, like Euros and Copa America.\n\nWant to know something even more surprising? Binance is a major sponsor for AFCON. Before expressing my main concern, I also found that Nigerian-founded payments startup, Flutterwave partnered with Afrosport TV, the cable channel that acquired AFCON broadcast rights. Cool, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, back to Binance. Getting the global crypto-trading platform on AFCON basically translates to legitimately allowing millions of Africans to see crypto ads on every matchday. The terms of the partnership involve having Binance adverts placed on the perimeter boards on all the stadiums hosting AFCON matches. 52 live matches!\n\nOh, the irony. I hope we\u2019re not quick to forget the hostility of African central banks and regulatory agencies toward digital currencies. One that readily comes to mind is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricting cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Despite all that, Africa still tops the chart regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platforms in terms of transaction volume globally. Source? 2020 and 2021 stats.\n\nRecall? Nigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions\n\nIt might not be convenient to argue that the football governing body for Africa, the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF), isn\u2019t aware of this apathy. Does this further confirm the suspicion that African governments, like many other countries, are comfortable with leaving the cryptocurrency sector unregulated only to clamp down on it occasionally?\n\nIt\u2019s not new. Between 2018 and now, more cryptocurrency and blockchain companies have gotten into sports worldwide. A crypto-trading platform, eToro is one of Europe\u2019s biggest football sponsors. Clubs like Tottenham Hotspur FC, Brighton & Hove Albion FC, Cardiff City FC, Crystal Palace FC, Leicester City FC, Newcastle United FC, and Southampton FC make the list. In fact, in 2021, Binance became the main jersey sponsor for S.S.

Conductors like speed; they want transactions to be done on time and will even ask you to \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t have change or worse, you forget your wallet at home? Scenarios like this propelled Micheal Oluwole and Olamide Afolabi to start the company, Touch and Pay (TAP).\n\nTAP is the company behind the Cowry cards used to pay for bus fares on BRT buses. The cards are Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled, so payment can be made with a single touch.\n\nAccording to Oluwole and Afolabi, the idea behind TAP is to create something close to cash transactions as this is the best way to digitise transactions in the informal sector where cash reigns supreme.\n\nThey spoke to Bolu about how they got the Lagos deal, their ups and downs and some of the big plans they have for the future.\n\nRead all about it here: How Touch and Pay (TAP) got 1.5 million Lagosians to adopt cashless bus rides\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nY Combinator will now invest $500,000 in accelerated companies.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a busy Thursday afternoon in one of Nigeria\u2019s busiest cities \u2014 Lagos. Three young men who needed to go from Ikotun to Agege hopped into the popular yellow buses known as Danfo.\n\nShortly after the journey began, the conductor asked for payment.\n\nThe man who was to pay their fare had no idea his wallet wasn\u2019t with him and confidently reached for it in its usual place \u2014 his back pocket \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t there. He calmly stuck his hand into the left-back pocket but withdrew it with a panicked look on his face.\n\nThat pocket, too, was empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreets of Lagos\n\nHis situation instantly became a drama; his fellow commuters, the audience, and he, the protagonist in a stage play with a bad script.\n\nThe conductor, who stood right in front of him, glared at him as he tried to come to terms with the situation.\n\nBeads of sweat had begun to appear on the young man\u2019s head. He wasn\u2019t okay. Although he knew he wouldn\u2019t find it, he searched his other pockets frantically.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten his wallet at home.\n\nResigned to his fate, he concluded that he and his friends were in trouble. When the conductor finally asked what the problem was, he asked, \u201cCan I do a transfer?\u201d\n\nThe conductor threw his head back in laughter but what followed was a very dark look.\n\nMichael Oluwole, Olamide Afolabi, and Yinka Adewale (Kudi CEO) had a similar experience, which led them \u2014 Oluwole and Afolabi \u2014 to create a digital payment system that is as seamless as cash payments.\n\nThey are the founders of Touch and Pay (TAP), creators of the contactless Cowry card used in paying bus fares. It is especially popular in Lagos, with over 1.5 million users. TAP is currently trying to replicate its success in Kaduna, Kano, Oyo, and Ogun States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoding from OAU to LAUTECH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP Co-Founder, Olamide Afolabi and Micheal Oluwole.\n\nThe three friends wanted to own a tech company since they were in university, so they did the techiest thing they could think of \u2014 coding.\n\nFrom what Afolabi told me, coding was perhaps the coolest thing to do in university then.\n\n\u201cWe were basically tech enthusiasts. In the university, we devoted most of our time to technology. We participated in Microsoft Imagine Cups and Microsoft student ambassadors. Those were the things that reigned seven or eight years ago. To be cool in school, you just had to be a member of a tech organisation.\u201d\n\nAfolabi went to Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Osun State, Nigeria, while Oluwole and Adewale studied at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Though Afolabi wasn\u2019t in the same school as his friends, he said they could still do things together.\n\n\u201cWe came together to participate in Microsoft Imagine Cups, and the first time we did it, we didn\u2019t even qualify. We did it the second time, and we came second, and the third time we won to represent Nigeria in Russia.\u201d\n\nThey were great at coding, and to them, that was all they needed to build a successful tech business, but after a couple of unsuccessful businesses, they quickly realised they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nThey came up with businesses such as Clinic Bell, a platform that helped doctors and patients secure appointments at a mutually convenient time. Still, the three went broke within a couple of months as their pocket money could not keep the business running.\n\nWhen they returned from Russia, they got into the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) and learnt that being able to code doesn\u2019t make you a good businessman.\n\nGetting the Lagos deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nTAP started the process of digitising microtransactions in 2017, but it didn\u2019t start with transportation. It piloted with different sectors before realising transportation was the way to go.\n\n\u201cBetween 2017 and 2019, we ran a lot of pilots. We created wristbands for Gidi Culture Festivals; we collected the Jangali tax in Kwara. We also deployed the technology at Babcock University and LAUTECH. We even tested it with microfinance banks and thrift collectors.\n\n\u201cAnd it was at that point we realised we couldn\u2019t keep stretching ourselves. We were probably a team of eight then.\u201d\n\nThe team asked, \u201cWhich sector can we look at that will give us traction in the shortest amount of time?\u201d\n\nThe answer was transportation, and they decided to focus on digitising transactions in that sector.\n\nOluwole said the decision to focus on transportation put them in the right place at the right time. They started by working with LAGBUS, creating a revenue assurance system that helps track revenue.\n\nImpressed by their work, LAGBUS recommended them to LAGFERRY to do the same thing. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, everything was about to change for TAP.\n\nSide note: LAGBUS was created by the Lagos State Government in conjunction with a private company in 2007 and has over ten franchises. LAGFERRY, on the other hand, was established in 1983 in conjunction with Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA). LAGBUS and LAGFERRY are under a single regulator, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA).\n\nPopularly known as BRT buses, LAGBUSes are anchored at several terminals across Lagos, where passengers get tickets to board buses. However, TAP has been contracted by LAGBUS to digitise the payment system. Passengers now load their Cowry cards at terminals instead of paying with cash and getting tickets. They pay by placing the cards on the NFC-enabled devices on the buses.\n\nThe entire country was in lockdown, and governments were saddled with the daunting task of figuring out a way to open up economic activities in the safest way possible. Transportation was obviously a strong spread point for the virus.\n\nExchanging cash, handing out bus tickets, and frequent communication were ways the virus could spread, and the Lagos State Government needed a solution.\n\nAfolabi defined the solution the State wanted specifically as \u201cthe contactless system just like Oyster in the UK.\u201d\n\nA lot of companies that could provide this solution came forward. Oluwole said they came from Cyprus and several other European countries. But their solutions did not conform with the realities of Lagos. He said many of them proffered online transactions, but Internet quality in Lagos and Europe differ significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwole and Afolabi live in Lagos, and they understood that a radical change that was too different from what people were used to would not work. And with enough experience with LAGBUS and LAGFERRY, TAP was the right company for the job. The startup formed a strategic partnership with the Lagos State Government to digitise the transport system.\n\nDigitising microtransactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrotransactions are daily transactions, like paying bus fares and buying things in traffic. They\u2019re transactions done with cash because they\u2019re inexpensive and are not worth the hassle of bank transfers or card payments.\n\nAs insignificant as they might seem, microtransactions are very important to the economy. They are what keep small businesses going. These small businesses are the backbone of the Nigerian economy. According to PwC, they have contributed 48% of the national GDP in the past five years.\n\nHowever, microtransactions are still largely cash-based in Nigeria. Towards the end of 2021, naira notes in circulation rose by 4.6%, signifying a high dependence on cash.\n\nHowever, digitising daily transactions is hard. Afolabi said it is understandable to use bank transfers for rent, school fees, and other large payments, but doing the same for micropayments isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nThe founders thought the best way to digitise small payments would be through contactless cards.\n\nOluwole said, \u201cWe needed to mimic cash transactions, and one of the characteristics of cash is that it is physical. It doesn\u2019t get network issues, and you receive the value immediately. Hence the reason why we went through the contactless route.\n\n\u201cToday, contactless works both online and mostly offline. So, if I perform a transaction, it will be completed whether there is a network connection or not.\u201d\n\nAfolabi chipped in that in the informal sector, it has always been speed over accuracy, which is why cash works.\n\n\u201cAny tech that will digitise cash transitions in the informal sector has to match the speed.\u201d\n\nOther startups have tried to digitise payment for public transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos\u2019 yellow buses. Source: Steemit\n\nThere are many problems with the public transport system in Nigeria, especially Lagos, and the easiest way to sum up these problems is through a single phrase, \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nThat phrase takes into account the ways of unruly bus conductors, uncomfortable sitting arrangements, and even the battle to secure a place for yourself in old rickety yellow buses.\n\nBut the most apparent meaning of the phrase is, only board a bus with the exact denomination of the bus fare or be prepared to give away your change.\n\nTAP isn\u2019t the first startup attempting to digitise payment on public transportation. In 2019, we featured Gona, a startup digitising bus payments with Quick Response (QR) codes.\n\nPassengers download the Gona app and scan one of the many QR codes that have been pasted in strategic points on the bus to pay their fares. However, we\u2019ve not heard much of the startup; lately, the website, getgona.com is also not functioning.\n\nInterestingly, Afolabi pointed out that TAP is also experimenting with QR codes, but they\u2019ve realised not everyone has a smartphone to scan them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment with QR code\n\nAccording to Statista, 48.12% of Nigerians use mobile Internet. It is projected that this number will hit 59.7% by 2026. Afolabi admits that the smartphone penetration in Nigeria is definitely growing, and scanning QR codes as a means of payment could be an iteration for TAP.\n\nATM cards have contactless capabilities too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nThe touch to pay technology on contactless cards is made possible by Near Field Communication technology or NFC. While NFC is just catching on as a payment method, it is not exactly a shiny new technology.\n\nIn 2006, Nokia created the first NFC-enabled mobile phone and most flagship smartphones since 2010 have NFC. Once a card or device has an NFC chip, it can exchange information with other NFC-enabled devices.\n\nMost bank cards also have this NFC chip in them. A radio wave image at the corner of an ATM card indicates it has an NFC chip. So why can\u2019t we just pay for bus rides with our bank cards?\n\nAfolabi\u2019s first answer is that bank cards still need the Internet to carry out transactions with NFC because the money has to be debited from the bank account. Where there\u2019s a network timeout or the recipient\u2019s bank isn\u2019t available, transactions will fail.\n\nOluwole explained this further with a bit of humour, asking, \u201cWould you go to the bank to complain that a \u20a6200 transaction did not go through? The current infrastructure we have today doesn\u2019t really support microtransactions,s and that\u2019s why we are creating a new framework.\u201d\n\nIt is also quite expensive for the merchant and the customer. According to Afolabi, there are charges that the card issuer (MasterCard or Visa), the bank, and the terminal provider deduct from every transaction, which is to the detriment of the merchant.\n\nAnother major reason why bank cards will not work is that \u201cwe still have so many people that don\u2019t have bank accounts.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) puts the number of Nigerians with a bank verification number (BVN) at 51.8 million as of January 2022. This leaves about 54 million Nigerian adults without a BVN.\n\nHe, however, admitted that TAP is working with some banks so users can top up their Cowry cards directly from their banks.\n\nA path to true financial inclusion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it\u2019s starting with transportation, TAP has plans to digitise the entire informal market with contactless cards and perhaps it could be a way to achieve true financial inclusion.\n\nThe founders explained that Cowry cards generate financial data about people that might not even have bank accounts.\n\nAn instance is how they\u2019ve deployed the technology in other states like Kaduna, Ogun, and Oyo. In Kaduna, for example, the Cowry card helps the government receive revenue from transport operators.\n\nOluwole pointed out that receiving the revenues via cash through a collector left out a lot of information that could be valuable to the government. The actual bus drivers or bus owners were unknown to the government even though they pay taxes regularly.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re changing that model by giving them a card which could also serve as their association ID card. They can fund this card and make their daily payments with it. The more they make these payments with the card, the more the government has access to them.\u201d\n\nPaying with the cards gives the government information about individual drivers and how much they pay tax. Giving tax returns or tax reliefs then becomes easy.\n\nBus drivers could also access insurance through the plethora of data the card payment system provides.\n\nBoth founders did not immediately admit they were positioned to solve the problem of true financial inclusion in the country when I asked them. However, they inadvertently did when they enthusiastically painted scenarios where the Cowry card could facilitate financial inclusion.\n\nOne of those scenarios is passengers getting rides on credit due to information available about their ride patterns.\n\nIt is important to note that all these could be possible without even having a bank account.\n\n\u201cThese are informal transactions, and nobody has been able to penetrate this sector. We are creating a simple platform that provides visibility into these transactions, and all of a sudden, the entire ecosystem changes and now we have data.\u201d Oluwole said.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a 2% or 5% fee on transactions. Oluwole hinted that merchants are happy to part with the fees because it doesn\u2019t only cover the transactions but the entire process of digitising a business.\n\nThe company has grown so far without raising any funds, but Communications Manager, Damilola Adebesin, said they have plans to raise in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I\u2019ve got quite an interesting lineup for you today, including some information (probably unwarranted) about super apps.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m discussing:\n\nBFREE $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\nInstant transfers in Tanzania\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup laws\n\nBFREE raises $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBFREE team; Source: TechCrunch\n\nNigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE has announced a $1.7 million pre-Series A as the company looks to expand to Asia, South America, Europe, and across Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis expansion drive will see the company move into 16 countries, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan, and Indonesia.\n\nThe round saw participation from 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures, and several other angel investors. This comes after the fintech\u2019s $800,000 seed raise in May 2021 and brings total disclosed funding to $2.5 million.\n\nIf you live in Nigeria or Kenya, chances are you might have received a text from a loan company debt shaming a friend, colleague, or family member. To solve issues like this and with experience working for digital lending startups, Julian Flosbach (CEO), Chukwudi Enyi (COO), and Moses Nmor (CPO) founded BFREE in 2020.\n\nCurious about BFREE? You should check out this in-depth article: How Nigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE, is helping Africans repay their loans\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company has hired two additions to the team: Konrad Pawlus (CTO) and Yohan Theatre, Head of Data Decision-Making and Financial Engineering.\n\nThe startup says it currently serves around 800,000 customers and has followed up 1.1 million defaulters to date, with Flosbach telling TechCrunch that the company looks to handle 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.\n\nThe African funding scene is off to a good start this year, with startups in different industries already bagging significant amounts. Last year was a good one, and you can check out Chimgozirim\u2019s analysis here: African startups raised $1 million every 2 hours in 2021 \u2014 Africa: The Big Deal\n\nTanzanians to enjoy instant transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has said that it expects to roll out its new payment system, Tanzania Instant Payment System (TIPS), in February 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, what does TIPS do? This payment system would enable Tanzanians to instantly transfer money to people in their mobile contact list without searching for their phone numbers. It would also allow the interoperability of digital financial services among payment service providers to make transactions cost-effective and secure.\n\nEssentially, users of all digital payment systems, including mobile money operators like Airtel Money, Tigo, M-Pesa, and HaloPesa, will be registered under a single platform and anyone can send money by searching the name of the registered recipient in the system.\n\nUnder Tanzania\u2019s present payment system, transfers are made within two hours of the initiation of the transaction. In an increasingly digital world, this could be a roadblock for everyday use cases in markets and shops.\n\nThree years in the making: preparations for TIPS first began in June 2018 following the passing into law of the Payment Systems Act 2015, which authorised the BoT to upgrade and create new financial systems. It was to be launched in 2020 but got shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter several delays, a potential date of December 2021 was given but was postponed due to upgrades being made to the system.\n\nComparing Africa\u2019s startup laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s recent history with startup acts appears promising. From the first foray by Tunisia in 2018 to the second by Senegal in 2020, countries on the continent are creating enabling environments for these disruptors.\n\nRecently, Nigeria-based technological advisory firm, Tech Hive Advisory and Africa-focused tech policy research NGO, Ikigai Innovation Initiative released a guide on African startup acts: Start-up Laws in Africa Vol. 2.\n\nThe guide highlighted and compared regulations \u2014 proposed and already existing \u2014 from six countries: Tunisia, Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Algeria.\n\nComparing the first five countries, the guide focused on the material and territorial scope of the different laws and regulations, labels and governance, incentives, and enforcement.\n\nAlthough there were several similarities, these regulations differed on several counts. For example, only Tunisia provides a paid vacation to resurrect fledgling startups, fully sponsored by the government. All five are quiet on monetary penalties.\n\nInterestingly, going by the four parameters, The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) appears to rank highest, with Tunisia coming in a close second.\n\nHowever, I noticed that on the table, regarding sanctions like withdrawal of labels and marks, The NSB got positive marks, contradicting an earlier position in the guide which stated that there were no provisions for a withdrawal of labels and marks.\n\nThe NSB has received approval from Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council and is expected to be presented to the National Assembly by Muhammadu Buhari, the country\u2019s president.\n\nCurrently, it appears there are no publicly available copies of the bill.\n\nWe can, however, (re)read Emmanuel\u2019s Paul\u2019s analysis here: Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nI\u2019m back with my music recommendations, and this weekend, I listened to a playlist I curated myself.

          "text": "Amid the low-interest-rate environment, high inflation and currency risks, there are investment strategies that can help investors reap from opportunities and close the gap in negative returns.\n\nInvestment analysts polled by BusinessDay tipped that investing in commercial papers, dollar investment and the stock market could reduce the impact of inflation, devaluation and other risks on savings and investments.\n\nWith the accelerating inflation, currently at 15.4 percent, and low-interest rate on the 364-day Treasury bill at 5.4 percent, the real return on investment across many Nigerian instruments remained in the negative.\n\nThe World Bank has also projected that Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate may be among the world\u2019s highest in 2022.\n\nBusinessDay polled six investment analysts to obtain their views on the best investment strategies in 2022.\n\nMoses Ojo, chief economist, PanAfrican Capital Holdings Limited\n\nDuring the year, there will be a lot of borrowing by the federal government to fund the budget, so we expect to see an increase in the fixed income rate.\n\nThere will also likely be a moderation in the returns in the equity market, so we are likely going to see investors take their investment from the equity to the fixed income market where they will likely find better returns.\n\nIn the first quarter, I expect to see the equity market move up as investors attempt to qualify for dividends that would be declared. In the second half of the year, when the federal government will be attempting to raise funds both in the domestic and international market, we expect to see a slight hike in the fixed income rate.\n\nFor the first quarter, equity investment is a good one but as we move towards the second half of the year, the fixed income market will be a good one for investors especially short-term investors that are after returns and not capital appreciation.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham\n\nInvestors must set objectives and understand their risk appetite to be able to maximize investment opportunities.\n\nRather than invest in treasury bills, you can look at commercial papers that come with higher premiums. It comes with higher risks but you can also look at the names of the companies issuing it before investing. There would be more issuance in the first quarter of the year, so investors should position themselves\n\nIt is also very important for investors to look at their exposure to dollar investment, maybe in terms of dollar mutual funds. This will help hedge their savings against inflation and any depreciation or devaluation of the naira.\n\nThe Nigerian stocks would also perform well in 2022 especially the financial services sector, telecommunication sector and industrial goods sector despite being a pre-election year.\n\nRead also: Nigerian stocks to watch in 2022\n\nObjective differs across investors, risk appetite differs so you will need to work with your portfolio manager to guide you but generally speaking, between 40-50 percent in money market investment, 30 percent in dollar investment and about 20 percent in equity and 10 percent in an alternative asset because of the high risk.\n\nGbolahan Ologunro, an economist at Lagos-based Cordros\n\nThe fixed income market will present opportunities for investors to generate good returns as yields are likely to retrace higher. This will be facilitated by the increased reliance on the domestic debt market in financing the high budget deficit alongside election uncertainties that will fuel demand for higher returns on risk-free assets.\n\nIncome investors can also get cash flows from dividend-paying stocks particularly the banking names given the attractive dividend yields.\n\nBeing a pre-election year, there will be consternation from foreign investors which will drive demand for dollars particularly in the second half of the year. Consequently, a long strategy on the greenback will also yield decent returns in the year.\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, investment research analyst, United Capital Plc\n\nInvesting in 2022 would require a very strategic and organized approach to achieving investment objectives. While the interest rate environment is currently uninspiring, that is expected to change during the year which should provide interesting opportunities for investors. Thus, a bit of patience for the yield environment to revert higher would be investors\u2019 best approach.\n\nThat said, expectations of higher yields would be negative for the equities market. Nevertheless, there would still be pockets of opportunities on stocks expected to deliver strong earnings. Thus, careful screening of companies with solid numbers in 2022 could provide equity returns for investors later in 2022.\n\nOmosuyi Temitope, investment strategy analyst, Afrinvest Limited\n\nThere are opportunities across all asset classes, what is more important is the right timing, investment objective and risk appetite.\n\nAlthough we have been seeing a significant decline in yield in Treasury bills and it may not be so attractive but if an investor needs security and is risk-averse, they can consider the fixed income market regardless of the low rates.\n\nBut if they can stomach some risk, the equities market is still attractive regardless of the pre-election year sentiments. The important thing is to know the right stocks to pick, when to invest and when to exit.\n\nAhmed Jinad, senior investment research analyst, Meristem Securities\n\nEven though yields are low in the fixed income market, there are still instruments that are high-yielding but they come with a higher level of risk and they might not be applicable to retail investors.\n\nTherefore, investors must match their expectations with their risk appetite. There are times investors will need to take a lower return if they are risk-averse and when market conditions improve they can take a more aggressive approach.\n\nFor the equities market, the factors are there to ensure the market is not bearish. Since the pandemic, there has been a higher level of participation by domestic investors who are more attuned to the uncertainties. This means they are not quick to sell off as foreign portfolio investors would, especially in a year that will see a lot of activities ahead of next year\u2019s elections, so we can expect less volatility.\n\nEarnings performance from last year showed most companies reported good results in 9 months so we would see companies paying dividends even if they do not increase it, they might sustain what they did last year. Overall, the triggers are there for the stock market to remain positive.",

          "text": "The year 2021 was a roller-coaster year for equities, with eight months of positive returns and four-month of bearish season. The market ended the year 2021 with impressive positive return of 6.7percent amid remarkable last-minute rally which helped push the value of listed stocks up by N1.23trillion in 2021.\n\nInterestingly, market liquidity and the record rally were driven majorly by domestic institutional and retail investors, thus reinforcing the potential of Nigerian investors in stabilizing and growing the market.\n\nNotwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year 2022.\n\nThe big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022? Stocks seen reoccurring in many analysts BUY lists for 2022 which investors should actively consider in their equities portfolio this year include Dangote Cement Plc, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Lafarge Africa Plc, GTCO Plc, Nestle Nigeria, Zenith Bank Plc, BUA Cement, BUA Foods Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, Access Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc and Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc.\n\nCurrently at the Nigerian market, many of these stocks are undervalued and present attractive BUY opportunities for investors seeking both capital appreciation and for long term returns in form of dividend yield.\n\n\u201cCompanies such as Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, GTCO, Nestle and Zenith Bank, which are our top picks, are resilient bellwethers with the history of sustaining earnings growth through political cycles,\u201d according to Isaac Olorungbon, Chief Executive of Deep Trust and Investments Limited.\n\nHe remains upbeat on the prospect of the Nigerian stock market in 2022, \u201cas our cautious optimism reinforces our outlook of another positive return for Nigerian equity investors in the new year\u201d.\n\nOthers are: Unilever Nigeria Plc, Okomu Oil Palm Plc, Presco Plc, Vitafoam Plc, Berger Paints Plc, Ardova Plc, SEPLAT Plc and Total Energies Marketing Nigeria Plc. Also on analysts BUY list are Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Guinness Nigeria Plc, Conoil Plc, FCMB Group Plc, May & Baker Plc, Fidson Healthcare Plc and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc.\n\nAmid increasing optimism in the market, likely modest rise in the interest rate environment may undermine funds flow to equities in 2022, but positive earnings outlook across most largely capitalised value stocks should reinforce the investment opportunities in those stocks.\n\nDangote Cement Plc\n\nDangote Cement Plc is Africa\u2019s leading cement producer with existing operations in 10 African Countries with a production capacity of 48.6million tonnes per year. The company\u2019s share price as at January 10, 2022 was N260 per share; year-to-date (YtD) change (+1.2percent); while in year 2021 the stock rose by +4.9percent.\n\nRead also: Stock market value rises by N1.33trn in first week of 2022\n\nMeristem analysts target price (TP) for Dangote Cement is N287.81; Vetiva analysts target price for the stock is N280; while United Capital analysts target price for Dangote Cement is N270.3. Going by these analysts 2022 target price for the cement maker, the stock has upside potential and should be considered a BUY.\n\nBUY rating is given to a stock considered highly undervalued, but with strong fundamentals, and where potential return in excess of or equal to 15percent is expected to be realized between its current price and analysts\u2019 target price (TP).\n\nAhead of its full-year (FY) 2021 results, its unaudited interim financial statements for nine months ended September 30, 2021, shows revenue grew to N1.022trillion as against N761.44billion 2021. Pretax profit for the nine months period was N405.487billion as against N271.960billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nEarnings per share increased to N16.23 in 9M\u201921 from N12.2 in 9M\u201920. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries is to operate plants for the preparation, manufacture, and distribution of cement and related products. Sector (Industrial Goods), Sub-Sector (Building Materials), Market Classification (Premium Board), and Shares Outstanding (17,040,507,405 units).\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications Plc\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTNN) is engaged in business of building and operating Global System for Mobiles (GSM) cellular network systems and other related services in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest telecommunications provider did a public offer of its shares from Wednesday, December 1 to December 14, 2021, which allowed retail investors to purchase up to 575 million shares at N169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the secondary market.\n\nAs at January 10, 2022, its share price of N185.5 per share represented negative return of 5.8percent year-to-date (YtD). The stock had risen by 16percent in the year 2021. In November 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria gave an approval-in-principle for the proposed MoMo Payment Service Bank Limited (PSB), a payment service bank (PSB) owned by MTN Nigeria Communications Plc.\n\n\u201cGoing into 2022, we believe that MTNN\u2019s 4G coverage will continue to be expansive, as it strives to meet the ever-growing data needs of Nigeria\u2019s population. Thus data revenue is projected to come in at N647 billion, up 25percent year-on-year (y/y).\n\n\u201cGiven that the NCC has lifted the suspension of new SIM card registrations, and with the company also hinting that it is actively ramping up new-registration centres, which will support the FG\u2019s NIN enrollment programme, we expect to see some gains in MTNN\u2019s subscriber base going forward. Thus, we expect this to somewhat provide a support system for voice revenue through 2022. However, we also bear in mind that voice services are subject to stiff competition, given the growing preference for internet-driven cheaper substitutes.\n\n\u201cWith the company now underway to getting a PSB licence, product offerings are up for a full-blown scale-up, and we might start to see considerable impact on MTN\u2019s top-line performance,\u201d according to Victoria Ejugwu, Oil & Gas, Telcoms analyst at Lagos-based Vetiva.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into the 2022 we are guided by our recent Nigerian telecom sector report \u2018Delivering a Digital Future\u2019, December 30, in which we recommend a BUY for MTN Nigeria with target price of N266.17/share and a Sell for Airtel Africa with a target price of N793.84/share\u201d, according to Coronation Research analysts in their January 4 note.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of MTN Nigeria Communications Plc for the nine months period ended September 30, 2021 shows that its revenue grew to N1.206trillion from 9M\u20192020 level of N975.764billion, up by 23.62percent.\n\nThe leading Telco\u2019s Profit Before Tax (PBT) in 9M\u201921 went up to N321.352billion from N211.594billion in 9M\u20192020, up by 51.87percent; while its basic/ diluted earnings per share increased to N10.82 from N7.09 in 9M\u20192020, up by 52.74percent.\n\nMTNN offers broadband fixed wireless access service, telecommunication services and mobile financial services (fintech) respectively. The Company\u2019s segments include Consumer Business Unit (CBU), Enterprise Business Unit (EBU) and Wholesale Business Unit (WBU).\n\nMTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications will each pay $273.6 million for Nigeria\u2019s first 5G high-speed spectrum licences that they were awarded following an auction held by country\u2019s telecoms regulator last month. Sector: (ICT); Sub Sector (Telecommunications Services); Market Classification (Premium Board) and Shares Outstanding (20,354,513,050 units).\n\nSeplat Energy Plc\n\nSeplat Energy Plc is a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and London Stock Exchange. The company believes that the greatest opportunity ahead of it is to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population and drive Nigeria\u2019s transition to cleaner, more affordable energy that is accessible to all. SEPLAT closed year 2021 at N650 per share, up by 61.6percent in 2021.\n\nAs at January 10, the stock price at N665 represents an increase of 2.3percent year-to-date (YtD). In its unaudited results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, SEPLAT grew revenue to N182.7billion from N135.6billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nGross profit went up to N58.1billion in 9M\u201921 from N31.7billion in 9M\u201920. Pre-tax profit grew to N38.6billion from loss before tax of N45.5billion in 9M\u20192020. For SEPLAT, ANOH project remains on track for first gas in H1 2022.\n\n\u201cA strong step forward will be when we bring on stream the ANOH project in 2022 delivering more transition gas to an energy poor market, over reliant on expensive, high carbon-emitting electricity generated from small-scale diesel and PMS generators\u201d, said Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer of SEPLAT Energy Plc.\n\nUnited Capital target price for SEPLAT is N770.4 with BUY rating. Meristem target price for SEPLAT is N754.42 supported with BUY rating. Vetiva also rated the stock a BUY with 2022 target price at N796.57.\n\n\u201cRecently, Seplat announced that the company was in discussions for a possible acquisition of some shallow water assets from ExxonMobil. Given that details of the acquisition are yet to be released to the public, we have not included the potential impact on the valuation of Seplat.\n\nHowever, should the deal materialize, we expect to see an increase in crude output, while we expect cost synergies to result from the integration of administrative operations for the combined entity,\u201d said Luke Ofojebe, Vetiva\u2019s head of research.\n\nSector (Oil & Gas); Sub Sector (Exploration and Production); Market Classification (Premium Board); and Shares Outstanding (588,444,561 units).\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria Plc\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria Plc, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading Food and Agro-allied Groups remains committed to executing its overall long-term strategy aimed at maintaining growth and sustaining profitability.\n\nRecently, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc and Honeywell Group Limited agreed to combine operations of FMN through its affiliates and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc (HFMP), a portfolio company of HGL, at a total enterprise value of N80 billion which will make Honeywell Group dispose of a 71.69percent stake in HFMP to FMN.\n\nThe proposed transaction will combine two businesses with shared goals and create a more resilient national champion in the Nigerian foods industry, ensuring long-term job creation and preservation.\n\nA combination of FMN and HFMP will bring together two trusted and iconic brands, creating a food business that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population, further enhance National food security objectives and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). FMN is devoted to feeding the nation while actively investing in attaining Nigeria\u2019s food self-sufficiency goals.\n\nFlour Mills was among best-performing stocks in 2021 (+183.3percent). In the trading week ended January 7, 2022, the share price of Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc closed at N29 per share, representing an increase of 2.3percent year-to-date (YtD).\n\nIn half-year (H1) (2021/2022), the Group revenue of Flour Mills of Nigeri Plc was N522.8 billion, compared to N355.1billion in H1 2020/21 which represents 47percent \u2013 year-on-year (YoY) growth. Performance was consistent across all key business segments in the group with Agro-allied and support segments, in particular, showing impressive growth by as much as 35percent. In the review H1 period, the Group\u2019s Profit Before Tax (PBT) was N15.5 billion, compared to N14.6 billion in H1 2020/21 (6percent \u2013 YoY growth).\n\nThis performance was underpinned by continued strong operating performance in the food segment; continuous improvement in Agro-allied and support segments. The Group\u2019s Profit After Tax (PAT) was N10.5 billion, compared to N9.9 billion in H1 2020/21 (6percent \u2013 YoY growth). The Group\u2019s solid operational performance was stimulated by strong organic growth, supported by product innovation, and continued momentum in retail sales.\n\nThe stock had on January 10 decreased this year by 0.9percent. United Capital research analysts said Flour Mills is a BUY considering their target price of N46.6 for the stock. Meristem also wants investors to buy Flour Mills considering their target price of N40.63.\n\nLagos-based Meristem research analysts in their January 10 stock recommendation urged investors to \u201cBUY\u201d Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc shares. Also, Vetiva\u2019s price target for Flour Mills is N44.34,\u201d said its Consumer Goods analyst, Chinma Ukadike.\n\n\u201cWe note that the company\u2019s volume growth strategy has been quite successful so far, across its Food and agro-allied segments. In line with this, we remain positive on the impact of newer product roll-out expected in the coming quarters\u201d, the analysts said.\n\nSector (Consumer Goods); Sub Sector (Food Products); Market Classification (Main Board); Shares Outstanding (4,100,379,605 units).",

          "title": "How Nigeria can get more from $1.5bn start-up funding",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem may have had 2021 as its best year with more than $1.5 billion recorded in investment, but a significant portion of that total funding did not enter into the Nigerian economy, experts say.\n\nApart from the talent that comes mostly from Nigeria, tech companies source equipment and infrastructure abroad, the two claiming a large share of the funding. Also, with the majority of the foreign investors coming from abroad, the decision for what is allocated to each segment is made from the company\u2019s headquarters, mostly abroad where the companies are incorporated.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about venture funding is that there are tight milestones attached to the money,\u201d notes a tech founder who pleaded anonymity. \u201cThis means there are agreements about what the money will be used for. However, it is a double-edged sword and if things don\u2019t go the way you planned it, it can be disastrous. This is the reason it is critical for startups to have good governance from the beginning to keep them honest and focused on the reason for raising funding.\u201d\n\nA report compiled by Maxime Bayen, senior venture builder at BFA Global, and Max Cuvellier, head of mobile for development, GSMA, shows just how busy Nigerian tech companies were in 2021. The report found that whereas fintech companies dominated the funding scene, one in every five dollars raised in 2021 was by a Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nOPay, a company that has its roots in Nigeria, took the largest slice of the funding with its record haul of $400 million. Nigeria also recorded three unicorns, Flutterwave, OPay, and Andela, the first of its kind by any African country in a calendar year.\n\nExperts attribute the record funding to five factors. The first is Nigeria\u2019s population size. It is really tough to ignore a market of 200 million people, even though the size of the middle class may be smaller relative to what is obtainable in more developed economies. The second factor is that venture capital firms will continue looking for new markets as the Western economic growth potentials flatten.\n\nMore Nigerian companies and founders getting into global accelerators, an indication of the high quality of the founders in the ecosystem, is attributed as the third factor. The fourth factor is that Nigeria\u2019s largely untapped economic potential makes it a good place to test hypotheses. It may be a tough environment to succeed in, but it also has a high mobile penetration, which is an indication of access to digital products.\n\nThe final factor is the growth of the fintech space and many fintech startups have done well to project their continental and global ambitions.\n\nNevertheless, a vast majority of the companies that received funding in 2021 have their headquarters located outside the country, despite their primary market being Nigeria and other African nations.\n\nFlutterwave (raised $170m, for example, has its main office at 1323, Columbus Avenue, San Francisco. OPay ($400m) was incorporated September 24, 2019, with a registered office at 19 Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, England, M4 4FY. Andela ($200m) sees itself as a US company with \u2018campuses\u2019 in Nigeria and other African countries. TradeDepot ($110m) is primarily located in San Francisco, CA, United States, and is part of the Computer Systems Design and Related Services Industry of that country. Kuda Bank ($80m) was primarily incorporated in 2015 in London.\n\nExperts say where a tech company is primarily incorporated is very significant for its operations. The ability to secure funding easily is one of the reasons. Foreign investors, which made up about 80 percent of the total funding raised by Nigerian companies, would have found it difficult to commit their money, especially in large sums to tech companies with primary bases in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: How 10 Nigerian startups have fared after Y Combinator funding\n\nOne reason for this is the unpredictability of macroeconomics in a country like Nigeria. For example, the country\u2019s inability to control the exchange rate is a big turn-off for many investors. Other problems like multiple taxation, poor digital infrastructure, and high inflation are some of the reasons tech companies run abroad to incorporate.\n\nQuite a number of the companies that secured funding in 2021 were incorporated in Delaware, a small mid-Atlantic US state that sits on a peninsula, for a reason. A US venture capital investor often prefers Delaware startups because of the several classes of stock that Delaware law allows. The law gives preferred stock investors of a corporation certain voting rights and control over the corporation. Many venture capitals (VCs) insist on the Delaware corporate form and will even require a startup to convert the current entity to a Delaware C Corporation before they are willing to invest.\n\nA startup registered in Delaware is taxed as a C-Corp. A c corporation (or C-corp) is a legal structure for a corporation in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. Often these Delaware corporations come with 10 million shares of common stock authorised with $0.0001 par value. Most of these corporations issue half of the shares to founders.\n\nThese corporations are seen as well-adapted to VC and angel investing over other forms of business entities.\n\nImportantly, US VC investors typically set standardised procedures for their investment activities and often require Delaware corporations for their investment targets. For instance, Y Combinator, a US seed money accelerator founded in 2005, requires that international startups they invest in are registered in the US as well as in their local countries. Y Combinator has invested in 30 Nigerian companies so far some of which include Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, Termii, and many others.\n\nAlthough many of the funders may genuinely want their funds to help develop Nigeria and the African continent, they are first businesses and want great returns. Investors also want security and peace of mind, this is why most times they insist on founders incorporating in friendly jurisdictions that would not make bad decisions, states a source in the industry.\n\nIt is equally important to note that institutional investors, some of which came into the African funding scene for the first time in 2021 are not angel investors. They are interested in the company meeting all the agreed milestones so that the next valuation is much higher and they can exit at a great position if that is the strategy. To ensure this becomes reality, many of them would take board positions, track the performance and push for growth.\n\nIn insisting startups are incorporated within their jurisdiction, the investors are trying to mitigate two risks: the risk of company failing and business environmental risks. The first kind of risk is tackled in different ways and can work out very well, just good or bad. But the business environment risks are more straightforward. Nigerian and most of Africa have bad perceptions and structural problems including poor tax structures, profit repatriation and low reputation for ease of doing business.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the government must decide to either play the good game or lose out,\u201d says a source that would not be named, to make him speak freely.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is that most of the best-funded startups are headquartered in other climes. This reality will have consequences in future liquidation events.\u201d\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, founder/managing partner of Future Africa, tells BusinessDay that the Nigerian economy benefits from talent recruitment, however, noting the risk of more of the money being spent abroad. The risk could also affect talent recruitment, where without a concerted effort to engage the universities to deliver more industry-ready talent, companies could be forced to outsource their development to other countries.\n\nAboyeji says Nigeriads to hire qualified talent at all levels. Who in the education sector is specifically delivering talent for this purpose,\u201d he asks.\n\nCompanies will also need more sophisticated financial services; especially given they have raised funding in dollars and would want to manage exchange rate risk much better. In this regard, Nigerian banks could come up with dedicated help desks for startups that have raised millions of dollars.\n\nAboyeji also notes that startups will need new kinds of real estate and infrastructure to scale.\n\n\u201cI remember the CEO of a global payments business that bought a Nigerian company recently asking over breakfast, \u2018where can I put 1000 engineers in Lagos\u2019?\u201d All of a sudden I realise that indeed there is no facility for that.\n\nIt was one of the reasons we decided to build Talent City, which is basically a city-scale infrastructure designed for tech companies and their employees to live, work, and play, he states. \u201cWe can go on and on. But the biggest determinant of whether Nigeria benefits from these funds is whether captains of industry and government wake up from their slumber, and design strategies to serve the industry properly,\u201d he says.",
          "summary": "Apart from the talent that comes mostly from Nigeria, tech companies source equipment and infrastructure abroad, the two claiming a large share of the funding.\nThe report found that whereas fintech companies dominated the funding scene, one in every five dollars raised in 2021 was by a Nigerian fintech startup.\nOPay, a company that has its roots in Nigeria, took the largest slice of the funding with its record haul of $400 million.\nA US venture capital investor often prefers Delaware startups because of the several classes of stock that Delaware law allows.\nY Combinator has invested in 30 Nigerian companies so far some of which include Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, Termii, and many others.",

Moreover, the programme has provided a much-needed boost to local economies by buying the products of smallholder farmers and providing jobs to more than 107,000 cooks from low-income families.\n\nSchools provide local farmers with a predictable outlet for their products, leading to a stable income, more investments and higher productivity. The children enjoy healthy, diversified food; this makes it more likely that they will stay in school, perform better, and improve their adult job prospects.\n\nIn line with one of the key pillars for sustaining the NHGSFP, several partnerships have been realised across various relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Government, which have truly strengthened the collaboration and cooperation for a more effective service delivery. Key partners include the National Youth Service Corp, Ministries of Agriculture, of Education, Information, Trade and Industry, Water Resources amongst others.\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Honorable Minister Sadiya Farouq, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, said, \u201cThe NHGSFP remains an important intervention of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Through it hunger, malnutrition, poverty, education can all be addressed. It is an investment that is fully funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria because of its sheer potential as a development driver.\n\n\u201cWe at the FMHADMSD are here to ensure that this programme is strengthened and sustained so that it can continue to support the needs of the children, families, women and communities it targets. The technical support from the World Food Programme is therefore timely, relevant and well appreciated.\u201d\n\nRonald Sibanda, WFP Country Director, in his own remarks, noted, \u201cOne of the best ways of fighting hunger and preventing malnutrition among children is to provide them with a healthy school meal. Nigeria is a good example of where the Government has taken the lead from day one and invested resources and funding into the design and implementation of its National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme. This is a great initiative and WFP is very pleased to provide technical support for the Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "text": "A political support group \u2018Got Your Back Nigeria\u2019 said Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi state has the support of even the opposition party to run for the presidency come 2023.\n\nNational coordinator of the group, Prof Chris Mustapha Nwaokobia Jnr, stated this in a press statement on Tuesday.\n\nProf. Nwaokobia Jnr was reacting to a recent debate on Channels TV\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nHe said Segun Sowunmi, a former spokesperson of Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation in the 2019 presidential election and Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, both profound speakers had their turns as the anchor grilled them on the politics of 2023 and the chances of presidential aspirants seeking to emerge as candidates of the two leading political parties.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cThe names listed on the PDP side were Atiku Abubakar, Aminu Tambuwal, Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Goodluck Jonathan and Pius Anyim. And on the APC side were names like Bola Tinubu, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Governor Yahaya Bello, Rochas Okorocha, Rotimi Amaechi, Godswill Akpabio, Kayode Fayemi and Babatunde Fashola. And Kingsley Moghalu, Akinwunmi Adesina, Jack Rich Tein, Oby Ezekwesili, and Tunde Bakare were those mentioned outside of the two major parties.\n\nProf. Nwaokobia Jnr said the guest from the PDP, Segun Sowunmi, was seen clearly in admitting that besides his boss, Atiku Abubakar, Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) was perhaps the most prepared to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\n\u201cHe admitted that GYB is broad minded (can carry along Nigerians of different tendencies), sagacious (creative and has the capacity to generate the ideas needed to make Nigeria work), youthful (has age and fitness), is competent, and can unite Nigerians. He practically craved and called on GYB to move over to the PDP to make real his ambition. It was an endorsement beyond Partisanship, and a testimony of the competency and the capacity of the phenomenon called GYB\n\n\u201cGYB is a pan Nigerian political and social vehicle, GYB is young, fit, active and vivacious, GYB has the ideas and is 21st century compliant, GYB is passionate about the Nigeria of our dreams, GYB is an apostle of human capital development, and GYB in so many ways have proven that the call to berth a new Nigeria is his unalterable commitment and destiny.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFinally on the program in reference, the Guests and the Anchor of that didactic show on politics (Politics Today), were unanimous in the chances of the name that stole the show. It was Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) everywhere throughout the duration of the show. It was Atiku Abubakar a few times, it was Kayode Fayemi and Babatunde Fashola once or twice, and the name Bola Ahmed Tinubu BAT hardly featured in the 1hour long program because apparently his age, fitness, and perhaps ideas needed to weave a united and cosmopolitan Nigeria is suspect. Baba BAT is obviously old and tired, and should be asked by all men and women of goodwill to rest,\u201d he claimed.",

Aliyu Aziz, said as the custodian of the foundational identity database for Africa\u2019s most populous nation, NIMC has gone to great lengths to ensure the nation\u2019s database is adequately secured and protected especially given the spate of cyber-attacks on networks across the world.\n\n\u201cOver the years, through painstaking efforts, NIMC has built a robust and credible system for Nigeria\u2019s identity database. The Commission and its infrastructure are certified to the ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard which are revalidated annually.\n\n\u201cNIMC has ensured maximum security of its systems and database because of the critical nature of the identity data which the Commission collects, manages and maintains as critical assets for the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Commission assured the public that it will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards in data security on behalf of the Federal Government and ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations.\n\nThe NIMC director-general added that the Commission does not use nor store information on the AWS cloud platform or any public cloud despite the usefulness of the NIMC Mobile App available to the public for accessing their national identification number (NIN) on-the-go.\n\nHe further stated that the NIMC MobileID application has no database within the App, nor does it store information in flat files, noting that the Commission has made this app available to the public to reduce and eliminate any delay or challenge(s) in accessing one\u2019s NIN.\n\nHe said that the public should be aware that the possession of a NIN slip does not amount to access to the\n\nNational Identity Database, but that the NIN slip is just a physical assertion of a person\u2019s identity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnder the data protection regulations, no licensed partner/vendor is authorized to scan and store copies of individuals NIN slips but rather authenticate the NIN using the approved and authorised verification platforms/channels provided.\n\n\u201cAs part of its policies to protect personally identifiable information stored in the National Identity Database, the public may recall that the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy through NIMC launched the Tokenization features of the NIN verification service. This solution is to safeguard the personal data of individuals and ensure continuous user rights and privacy,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn compliance with the mandatory use of NIN for government services, the Commission also hailed the concerted efforts of several Federal Government agencies such as Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB), the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigeria Immigration Services, Pension Commission (PenCom), the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigeria Correctional Service, the Nigeria Customs, and a host of others, who have streamlined their services in line with the use of National Identification Number (NIN) as the valid means of identification.\n\nEngr Aziz also appealed to all stakeholders to embrace the identity, enrol and receive their NINs. He\n\nopined that the Federal Government\u2019s efforts in providing security and economic solace for all Nigerians will be enhanced when the entire population is enrolled into the national identity\n\ndatabase.",

          "title": "Those saying Presidency shouldn't be zoned in PDP are agents of APC",
          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on Tuesday said members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who are saying the presidency should not be zoned are agents of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nFormer Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who is interested in contesting the 2023 presidency had said on Monday that the presidency should not be zoned to the South.\n\nWike spoke when he visited Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to commiserate with him on the death of the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Adetunji.\n\n\u201cForget about the people saying there should not be zoning. It is just a distraction. For me, those doing that are agents of the APC and they are not helping the party. Whichever way, we must sit down and take the best decision that will make Nigerians to be happy; that will make us to win the election.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for anything we do that won\u2019t make us win the election, because it means we still want Nigerians to suffer and they cannot just continue to suffer. They have suffered enough in the hands of APC and God will not forgive PDP if we don\u2019t rescue Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe you are one of the people doing well in your state. We must take a decision. Not taking a decision means that there is no leadership. It is not like a situation we have in the APC where they will say one thing today and, tomorrow, they will say another thing. They don\u2019t even know who is in charge. But you are in charge of Oyo State and you are doing well,\u201d Wike told Makinde.\n\nWike said he and others had come to let Makinde know that it was important for them as a party to unite a lot of Nigerians who were waiting for the PDP and that the party could not afford to lose this opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe governors must be united. It does not matter who would be the party\u2019s presidential candidate. Once the party and governors are united, I can tell you that the victory is on our way. So, the unity of the governor is key to making sure the party gets it right.\n\n\u201cIt was the way we were united that made us produce the National Chairman and the best National Convention, which got Nigerians surprised. We should also do the same by working hard to produce the presidential candidate, who will win the election for the PDP. This is because if we lose it this time around, Nigerians will not be happy with us.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow this evil they call APC to continue and that is why they cannot put themselves together. So, God has used people like you to unite the party and to organise the best convention. Mine is going around telling our people to let us work together as a party so that we will be able to stand APC in the next general election. We must all rally round anybody the party produces to be the presidential candidate and make sure that we win the election,\u201d he said.\n\nWike further charged Makinde not to be distracted by criticisms, urging him to continue to do well, while also charging his aides and residents of the state to keep supporting him.\n\n\u201cPeople must criticise, even in a family, it happens. So, be focused and don\u2019t be distracted. Continue to do well. This is a public office and not the same with a private business but that experience has helped you a lot to move the state forward.\n\n\u201cI also want to urge your aides to continue to give you the needed support. Most people fail because of their aides, because they are not committed. But for you to have travelled for some days and things still worked, it means your aides are committed and I want to commend you all. You are a part of those that have changed Oyo State,\u201d Wike added.\n\nSpeaking, Makinde said Wike had shown leadership in piloting the affairs of Rivers State, saying he had shown leadership nationally and in pushing for what was right and just in the affairs of the party.\n\n\u201cWe can only pray for more strength and good health so that you will continue to render your service, at least, till the end of your tenure in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cFor us in Oyo State, we are following in your footsteps by giving dividends of democracy to our people. It is all about serving the people.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned just now about individuals jostling for the Presidency of our country under our party\u2019s banner and what they need to know. Well, you have demonstrated it, and this is what we are doing in Oyo State. It is not seeking power for the sake of wanting to be in power but for the sake of making our country and our state a little better than the way we have met it. This has been demonstrated time and time again, especially in Rivers State and that is what we are also doing here.\n\n\u201cThe unity, especially that of the governors of our party is paramount and most of the successes we have recorded so far are really because we are together,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Makinde, 2022 would be a decisive year in the agenda to rescue Nigeria from the disaster brought upon it by close to seven years of APC leadership at the centre, hence the importance of the visit by Governor Wike and the unity among the PDP governors.\n\n\u201cThis visit is timely and appreciated, because 2022 is the year when the political parties will take decisions on who would fly the flags of their parties, from the Presidency to even the lowest positions.\n\n\u201cThis is a year we have to take serious decisions, because whatever we do and whatever the outcome is, Nigerians will have to live with that for the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe past seven years have been a real disaster. If you look at the data, an economy that was growing at the rate of 5 to 6 per cent yearly before then suddenly became poor. We went into recession and we thought we were coming out but still went into another recession.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the population is also growing at an alarming rate. So, just like our party has been pushing, this is the time to rescue Nigeria. We have a serious role to play in that effort,\u201d Makinde added.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nGovernor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state Tuesday formally informed President Muhammadu Buhari of 2023 presidential ambition on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after a chieftain of the party Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu told the President of his ambition to contest for the APC presidential ticket.\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents after a meeting with Buhari in his office in Abuja, the governor said the President advised him to consult widely.\n\nThe governor said he was not perturbed by Tinubu\u2019s entry into the race as he believes that the contest is not about might.\n\nHe said if he gets the opportunity, his presidency would replicate the current effort in Ebonyi state at the national level, stressing that he has a lot to show in running governance as business.\n\n\u201cI told Mr. President, that without prejudice to whatever will be the decision of the party, which we shall abide by, that if the party throws the ticket open or zoned to southern part of Nigeria that I believe that with what I have put in place in the past six years plus, that I\u2019ll be running for presidency, on the platform of APC.\n\n\u201cSo, I told him and, of course, he believes that whoever wants to run for president of this country must have to consult widely, go to all the leaders and that we must do everything to remove ethnicity and religion in our politics so that this country can grow,\u201d he said.\n\nOn APC convention\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Mr. President who must have the final say on the date for convention. And I don\u2019t believe that the governor you mentioned should have spoken for the party because if it is APC governors forum, we have a leader, the chairman who is the His Excellency, the governor of Kebbi State.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t even aware of the meeting when I called him. And if it is the party administration, we have His Excellency, the governor of Yobe state. And I think these two would have been able to speak to the press, if we\u2019re going to have such a meeting on Sunday. So I was not aware but I had to inquire from the chairman of APC Governors Forum who wasn\u2019t also aware. So I\u2019m not sure the meeting held.\n\n\u201cBut I read on a newspaper sometimes when the party leadership came to brief Mr. President, and they told him February convention. Mr. President said yes. He is not a man that says yes and says no, at the same time, he is a man of integrity, he is a man of his words. So I believe that if he ever said February that is going to stick to that February. I am very sure of that but it is for him to speak or for the party leadership to speak. I speak for my state.\u201d\n\nOn Ohaneze Ndigbo\u201cOhaneze leadership should not play politics. Yes, they can speak for the interest of the south East, they can speak for fair treatment to south East as people but as a matter of equity, justice and fairness, and leaving a level playing field for all the political parties and the aspirants.\n\n\u201cThey should not dabble into politics or whom to support or whom not to support. I think that they hear it just like the heard other the political parties aspirants. We will also write them to notify them that yes, they have culpable sons and daughters that if God wills, that could do this job.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, former governor of Abia state and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Tuesday declared that he would contest for the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket if the party zones the position to the south.\n\n\u201cI have all it takes to throw my hat into the ring and contest with anybody from the southern axis of the country if our party zoned its Presidential ticket to the area.\n\n\u201cTinubu like any other qualified Nigerian , is isligible to run for the Nation\u2019s number one position but those of us from the South East feel the zone should be considered in terms of zoning.\n\n\u201cIf however is left open , I will square it up with Tinubu and any other contender grit for grit,\u201d he said.",

Because we are talking based on what Nigeria should be. We are talking based on what people should believe. Obasanjo has been President for eight years. Osinbajo is doing eight years as Vice President. And no Igbo man since independence has been a democratically elected President. So it is always good to think of what is reasonable and what will be more sellable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most prepared Presidential candidate in Nigeria. I\u2019m capable healthwise, I\u2019m capable as a person, I\u2019m capable in my pocket. I\u2019m capable to face anybody. But the party is supreme. I only wait for APC as a party.\n\n\u201cFor me, contesting for President is not the issue. The issue is who is going to lead the country into an economic miracle, into a turnaround. I\u2019m not against Tinubu. If it\u2019s zoned to his area and the party said he should go. Well, the party is supreme. I\u2019m only waiting for the party.\u201d\n\nUmahi\u2019s conviction\n\nAfter his State House briefing, Governor Umahi appeared on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today to provide further insights into his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cI feel within me that the country is passing through a phase and I believe strongly that the miracles that God helped us to do in Ebonyi State by the reason of all the successes we made in all the economic indices and all our programmes, that if given the opportunity, we can replicate it at the national level,\u201d he said.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe explained that his closeness with President Buhari has given him a clear understanding of the President\u2019s intentions and goodwill for the country and he intends to continue from where he stops come 2023.\n\n\u201cThis is my conviction and that we can also build from where Mr President would stop,\u201d Umahi said. \u201cI am also close to Mr President, I know his heartbeat for the country and I know what he desires for this country so I think that I understand his programmes and his policies and his integrity, coupled with what we have done in Ebonyi State and it can add and help the country.\u201d",

It was very, very hot and extremely humid,\u201d said Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi.\n\n\u201cWe are close to Italy\u2019s unbeaten record, which is good. We are unbeaten in three years, but we don\u2019t think about that ahead of every game.

          "text": "More than half of people in Europe will likely catch Omicron by March, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, as the World Bank warned the contagious variant could hamper global economic recovery.\n\nMillions in China were locked down again, exactly two years after Beijing reported the first death from what was later confirmed to be coronavirus.\n\nThe highly transmissible Omicron strain has swept across countries, forcing governments to impose fresh measures and some rolling out vaccine booster shots.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Deltacron\u2019 Likely Result Of Lab Error, Experts Say\n\nBut the WHO on Tuesday warned that repeating booster doses of the original Covid jabs was not a viable strategy against emerging variants.\n\nThe UN body called for new vaccines that better protect against transmission.\n\n\u201cA vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable,\u201d a WHO vaccine advisory group said.\n\nWith almost eight million recorded infections over the past seven days, Europe is currently reporting the largest number of deaths and cases worldwide, according to an AFP tally.\n\nEurope is at the epicentre of alarming new outbreaks and the WHO said Tuesday Omicron could infect half of all people in the region at current rates.\n\nEuropean \u2018tidal wave\u2019\n\nThe WHO\u2019s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge described a \u201cnew west-to-east tidal wave sweeping across\u201d the region.\n\n\u201cThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) forecasts that more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks,\u201d he added.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s European region covers 53 countries and territories including several in Central Asia, and Kluge said 50 of them had Omicron cases.\n\nKluge however stressed \u201capproved vaccines do continue to provide good protection against severe disease and death \u2014 including for Omicron\u201d.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that the spread of Omicron was pushing Covid towards being an endemic disease that humanity could live with, even if it remained a pandemic for now.\n\n\u2018Permanent scar on development\u2019\n\nThe World Bank, meanwhile, predicted global economic growth will decelerate in 2022 as Omicron risks exacerbating labour shortages and supply chain snarls.\n\nIn its latest Global Economic Prospects report, it cut its forecast for world economic growth this year to 4.1 percent after the 5.5 percent rebound last year.\n\nWorld Bank President David Malpass said the pandemic could leave a \u201cpermanent scar on development\u201d as poverty, nutrition and health indicators move in the wrong direction.\n\nThe warnings came exactly two years after the announcement of the first person dying of a virus only later identified as Covid \u2014 a 61-year-old man in Wuhan, China, where the illness was first detected.\n\nSince January 11, 2020, known fatalities in the pandemic have soared to nearly 5.5 million.\n\nChina largely tamed its initial outbreak using lockdowns, border closures and mass testing, but flare-ups in some major cities are testing that zero-Covid strategy just weeks before the Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nThe city of Anyang in Henan province on Monday night told its five million residents not to leave their homes or drive cars on the roads, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said.\n\nThe cities of Yuzhou and Xi\u2019an have also entered strict lockdowns.\n\nHong Kong, which already has some of the toughest coronavirus border restrictions in the world, on Tuesday shut kindergartens and primary schools until early February to fight an Omicron outbreak.\n\nAnd Japan extended until the end of next month a strict Covid border policy that bars almost all new foreign foreign arrivals.\n\nUnequal vaccine access\n\nThe World Economic Forum warned that the widening gap in unequal access to vaccines could create a poisonous legacy of resentment,making it harder to reach agreements on global issues such as climate change.\n\n\u201cA greater prevalence of Covid-19 in low-vaccination countries than in high-vaccination ones will weigh on worker availability and productivity, disrupt supply chains and weaken consumption,\u201d WEF said.\n\nThe polarising nature of the Covid came into sharp focus last week when Australia cancelled the visa of the world\u2019s top men\u2019s tennis player over Covid shot requirements.\n\nThe unjabbed, vaccine-sceptic Novak Djokovic won a legal challenge against the government Monday, but Australia\u2019s immigration minister reserves the right to cancel his visa again as the Serbian aims to defend his Australian Open title.\n\nIn France, unions say three out of four teachers plan to strike on Thursday against the government\u2019s shifting rules on Covid testing for students, forcing half the country\u2019s primary schools to close.\n\nAnd Bolivia\u2019s vice president David Choquehuanca, who touts indigenous treatments for Covid-19, has contracted the virus for a third time, the government announced.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had caught it for a second time.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The biggest match of the Africa Cup of Nations so far saw Nigeria emerge victorious over Egypt in Group D.\n\nThe second true heavyweight match in Cameroon saw Nigeria take firm control of Group D with a 1-0 victory over Mohamed Salah and Egypt.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s game between Morocco and Ghana saw the Atlas Lions come away with a 1-0 victory, football lovers were treated to another matchup of expected title contenders, and the result showed one side is far more prepared to push for the crown than the other.\n\nThe two teams sparred in the opening half hour, with Nantes\u2019 winger Moses Simon looking dangerous, but neither team had a major chance until Leicester striker Kelechi Iheanacho beautifully controlled a ball on the edge of the area and fired it across his body into the Egypt net.\n\nThis goal, rather than prod Egypt into action, only seemed to spur on Nigeria. The Eagles had several chances either side of the break, with Taiwo Awoniyi brilliantly kept out by Mohamed El Shenawy, and a clumsy touch from Iheanacho causing him to spurn a chance to double his tally.\n\nEgypt had one chance in the second half when Nigeria\u2019s defence seemingly thought Salah had been caught offside, but the Egyptian maestro couldn\u2019t lift the ball over Maduka Okoye. In a battle of the captains, he was frustrated throughout by Watford\u2019s William Troost-Ekong.\n\nNigerian substitute Chidera Ejuke could have cemented his country\u2019s win in the final minute, but his length-of-the-pitch break was hit straight at El Shenawy.\n\nIn the end, Iheanacho\u2019s goal was enough to see the Super Eagles triumph.\n\nThe Leicester City man, alongside Moses Simon and Joe Aribo formed what looked like the best attack of the tournament thus far (with new boys Awoniyi and Ejuke also showing promise), which is rather impressive when taking into account the big names like Victor Osimhen and Odion Ighalo the Eagles are missing up front.\n\nDemola Ojo",
