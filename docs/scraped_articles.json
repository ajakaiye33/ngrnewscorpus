          "title": "N100m form: Buhari, APC corrupting Nigeria\u2019s democracy, says Ozekhome",
          "text": "Human Rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress and the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), of corrupting the nation\u2019s democracy by pegging the party\u2019s presidential nomination form at N100 million.\n\nHe slammed the President, whom he said, decried the high cost of form before his emergence for supporting the outrageous fee.\n\nOzekhome questioned where the likes of the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbanjo, the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, among others would get the money to purchase the form.\n\nHe disclosed this in a statement on Thursday night.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe party hopes to rake in #1.5 billion from the 15 aspirants that have so far declared interest in the presidential race. By this singular act, the APC has shown a shocking insatiable bacchanalian propensity to corrupt democracy, and democratic echoes, and also scam the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of this exercise lies not just in the abominable fee prescribed, but more in the party\u2019s pretentious mantra of fighting corruption, using a well-orchestrated and carefully oiled Hitler\u2019s Goebel\u2019s propagandist machinery of dubious pedigree.\n\n\u201cIt is the more abhorrent when we realize that this is miles apart from (indeed more than double) the price fixed by the party\u2019s whipping child, the opposition PDP, which has fixed N40million (N5 million) for the nomination of interest; and N35 million for the nomination form. The N100m is also over 100% of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammed Buhari and the APC have, by this singular act, exhibited a very odious and unpleasant example of how not to fight corruption.\n\n\u201cNigerians should recall that in the prelude to 2015 the presidential elections, President Buhari had trenchantly criticized the N27.5 million levy imposed on his party aspirants for a presidential nomination form. He had pooh pooed it as exorbitant. He has now supported N100 million for the same exercise.\n\n\u201cWith the new amended Electoral Act of 2022 fixing N5 billion limit for a presidential campaign as against the earlier N1billion under the 2010 Electoral Act, as amended, Nigeria\u2019s politics and democracy have been completely moneticised with a swing towards anti-people capitalist mercantilism.\u201d\n\n.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n. As PDP stakeholders agree to work together\n\n. Supports full autonomy for LGAs\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nSenator Mao Ohuabunwa has vowed that the imposition of candidates would not be allowed again in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State.\n\nThe former Leader ECOWAS Parliament made the declaration while addressing Peoples Democratic Party, PDP stakeholders from the LGA in his country home said every member of the party would be involved in the process of choosing candidates for the party.\n\nHe regretted that Arochukwu, a stronghold of PDP, suddenly fell into the hands of the opposition party due to sabotage and backstabbing by some blacklegs in the party.\n\nHe, however, said he had put the past behind him and urged everyone to be committed to the rebuilding of the party.\n\nOhuabunwa vowed to stop at nothing in ensuring that \u201cPDP recaptures Arochukwu which has been the party\u2019s enclave\u201d.\n\nDeclaring that the era of the anointing of candidates is over, Ohuabunwa told aspirants of various political offices in the council to be ready to show their scorecards.\n\nHe said that any aspirant without the support of the masses would not be given the party\u2019s ticket as that would affect the fortunes of the party at the main election.\n\nOhuabunwa said that the House of Representatives seat should be rotated between Arochukwu and Ohafia LGAs, insisting that it will be the turn of Ohafia LGA to produce the occupant in 2023.\n\nHe said that rotation of the seat would promote equity and peace, and eliminate politics of bitterness in the constituency.\n\nSenator Ohuabunwa lent his weight behind the clamour for a power shift to Abia North in 2023, saying that \u201d we believe there is already a wheel going round, and it should continue for peace, justice and equity\u201d.\n\nOhuabunwa who said he had a knack for the Parliament vowed that nothing would stop his return bid to the red chamber in 2023 to advance the cause of Abia North.\n\nHe tasked the stakeholders with unity, stressing that if they would all remain united as a family, no party will be able to dislodge PDP in Arochukwu LGA and the entire Abia North.\n\nSenator Ohuabunwa also restated his support for full financial autonomy for LGAs in the country to fast-track development in the third tier of Government.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakeholders who blamed the loss of Senator Ohuabunwa to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu of the All Progressive Congress, APC, in 2019 on sabotage by some black legs, vowed to avoid a repeat of the \u201c2019 mistake\u201d.\n\nThe stakeholders comprising all PDP Counselors, Council and Ward Executive members as well as zonal exco members and other chieftains of the party vowed to work together to deliver the LGA to PDP at all levels of the 2023 elections.\n\nAddressing the stakeholders, PDP Chairman in the Council, Chief Sunday Okemiri, regretted that factionalisation had been the undoing of the party, and appealed to the gladiators to sheath their swords for the sake of peace.\n\nOkemiri noted that although somebody might have facilitated his emergence, he was not for anybody but for the survival and advancement of the party.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Chairmen of Wards, Ozom Peters of Aro Ward 2, vowed that any gladiator \u201cthat refuses to embrace peace will receive Oshomhole treatment\u201d.\n\n\u201d We the ward Chairmen in Arochukwu LGA have decided to de-register any stakeholder that refuses to embrace peace so that Arochukwu PDP can recover its lost grounds\u201d, Peters threatened.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Counselors, Hon. George Onwumere representing Ward 3 said the Counselors had resolved to detach themselves from the control of any gladiator but work together for the good of the entire Council.\n\nHe blamed the leadership tussle rocking the Arochukwu Legislative arm on the imposition of principal officers by certain stakeholders but added that the Counselors had resolved to put their differences behind.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the major stakeholders, former Commissioner for Joint Projects, Mr JJ Okoro, assured Ohuabunwa of the full support of Arochukwu stakeholders, saying \u201cthe mistake of 2019 will not be repeated\u201d.\n\nHe, however, urged him to continue his consultations with stakeholders in other LGAs in Abia North, \u201cbut as for Arochukwu LGA, go and sleep and leave the job for us\u201d.\n\nIn a remark, PDP Vice Chairman, Abia North, Elder Amah Abraham, said the greatest challenge he faced after his election was how to unite the various factions in Arochukwu PDP.\n\nHe, however, expressed delight at the resolve of the stakeholders to embrace peace and urged all to place the party\u2019s interest above personal interests.",

          "text": "\u2026.says Nigeria will not change until Nigerians change attitude\n\n\u2026.as WLBC empowers 1,100 Nigerians\n\nBy Sam Eyoboka, Akpokona Omafuare and Olayinka Latona\n\nAS Nigerians gear up for another political elections the immediate past president of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, His Eminence, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor has advised Nigerians to shun any form of financial inducement to mortgage their future selling their votes to desperate politicians at the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nOritsejafor who is also the founder of Word of Life Bible Church, Warri in Delta State made the call at the 15th edition of the church\u2019s Micro-Business Empowerment Programme held at the church\u2019s premises in Warri, Delta State.\n\nPastor Oritsejafor, who described vote-buying as an attempt to change a dishonest and corrupt system through corrupt means, stressed the need for the electorate to question the competence and antecedents of the candidates running for political offices before making the choice of whom to vote.\n\nIn his words: \u201cI plead with you, when politicians come and start giving you two thousand naira, do either of two things; either you take the two thousand naira, spend it and don\u2019t do what they want you to do and don\u2019t vote for them because they have not being there for you before now. Now they want your fake vote, they are still going to rig the election, so they need your fake vote and give you two thousand naira, five thousand naira, one quarter bag of rice, salt and all these nonsense.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is simple, plain truth. Don\u2019t mortgage your future for their few currencies now and they later abandon you when they succeed at the polls.\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ayo Oritsejafor doles out N65m to empower members\n\nHe further urged Nigerians to be agents of change in their various capacities so as to contribute their quota to bringing about the change that the nation needs. \u201cOur environment will not change until we change this attitude\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the empowerment programme, the cleric noted that the programme was aimed at making the much neglected people self-reliant, adding that the church through its empowerment programmes want to take girls off the brothels, take able young people off the streets where they do nothing but plan devilish plots against the society.\n\nAdvising the over 700 training and beneficiaries, pastor Oritsejafor urged them to be confident and proud of their legitimate business adding that the mind of Jesus Christ is for them to master their world and not a slave or begger.\n\nIn his words: \u201cThe resurrected Christ has two interess in us. One to take us to heaven, two for us to be masters of our own world. Master your own world. You must not be a slave in your own. A slave is somebody if he or she was not given water or food he cannot eat or drink. That is not the mind of Christ for His children.\n\n\u201cThe token plus what we have tried to teach you are for you to get something doing. Be proud of it,\u201d he said..\n\n\u201cBe confident of yourself, don\u2019t look down on yourself because the way you carry yourself that is the way people will see and address you. Like what you do and be proud of your legitimate business. Do your business with all honesty, dignity and be creative with it\u201d he pointed out.\n\nSpeaking on the need for dignity of labor in the country, Oritsejafor said all jobs are to be respected equally and accorded equal respect without any discrimination based on the type of work it is.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important for us in this nation to re-emphasis the dignity of labor. People must be proud to be rather a groundnut seller rather than a begger.\n\n\u201cOur environment, we are thought that all you need is money, either you steal it or do anything to get money , what our environment is saying is that make sure you get money. Because if you don\u2019t have money you are nothing. That is our environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admire young ladies, some of them under the sun at some strategic junctions, who, instead of selling their bodies, get people to use the PoS and get a little commission out of it.\n\n\u201cIf you are making N5, be proud of it. You are better than a thief who makes N1 million a day and is worth nothing. Don\u2019t look down on yourself.\n\nDirector of Microbusiness Empowerment Programme, Pastor Okeoghene Obiegbedi, said that the programme kicked off in December 2005, with an average cost of N30 million per edition.\n\nThe beneficiaries, who are members of the church, passed through a one-month \u201cdiscipleship training\u201d and were \u201cscreened and trained in different trades and skills\u201d such as drying fresh fish, catering, shoemaking, and soap making tailoring and others.\n\nPastor Obiegbedi revealed that the 2021/2022 empowerment Programme, which is the 15th edition targeted to empower 1,100 individuals with N55, 000 each, totalling N60.5 million.\n\nHe further listed other humanitarian gestures by the cleric and the church to include scholarships to over 1,918 indigent students to study in Nigerian universities and polytechnics, donation of motorcycles, tricycles, new cars, and grinding and sewing machines among others.",

Nevertheless, the long arm of the Law has finally caught up with those monsters in uniform as the Federal High Court proceeded to hear our Suit on the merit and consequently, directed for her unconditional release.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamages were equally awarded against the suspended DCP \u2013 Abba Kyari together with his disbanded outfit, for the gross violation of Mrs Ezediaro\u2019s Fundamental Rights. The Federal High Court seised of the frivolous charge brought against her equally granted her bail on our Application.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, (Thursday) Mrs Ezediaro has finally regained her freedom and presently walking the street a free person. Be assured UmuChineke, that we are vigorously pursuing the bail applications of every other person(s) arrested and detained in similar circumstances and they shall all regain their freedom in due course.\n\n\u201cMy team and I shall stop at nothing to ensure that all UmuChineke arrested and still detained at various detention facilities of the Nigerian Security Agencies are released,\u201d Ejiofor said.",

One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things. Since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have but the plight is that they are inadequate, so to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the porous nature of Nigerian borders and how it is impacting on national security, the NSA attributed some of the challenge to the extensive nature of our borders.\n\nHis words, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone. All of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, the most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime to domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact is not a conjecture, I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of effort to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that the council is looking into.\u201d",

          "text": "Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has told delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Taraba State that if he secures the party\u2019s ticket and wins the election, he will take the war to bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe one problem that our PDP government(under me if elected) must solve is to bring down the level of insecurity in this country otherwise there is no way the economy can grow.\n\n\u201cWhen bandits hear my name they will run because I will take the war to them. I will be the Commander- in-Chief in action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be commanding in projects, in security, in agriculture and the economy together with the armed forces. I\u2019ll be commanding every aspects of life that will make Nigerians happy. This is because I have the capacity to solve the problems of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWike in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, also said the establishment of state police would be one enduring approach to addressing the festering insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe Governor, while wooing delegates of PDP in Taraba State in Jalingo on Thursday, dismissed the argument against the need for state police.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Federal Government, you cannot stop this insecurity if you don\u2019t have state police. You must have state police, there is no two ways about it.\n\n\u201cHaving a state police does not mean you will not have a federal police. All over the federal system, even councils have their own police so that you employ people who know the environment.\n\n\u201cYou cannot take a stranger to go to Mabila, it will take him years to understand that place. You can\u2019t take a stranger and go to Donga or Chanchangi. So, you need people who know the environment so they will be able to take care of the place.\n\n\u201cIf federal offences are committed, the federal police should handle them. If they are state offences, the state police should handle. So one key thing to stop this insecurity in Nigeria is to have state police.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers governor said those opposing state police often argued that if allowed, governors would use it against their opponents.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is will the governors be in office permanently? So, that argument is neither here or there. If this party called APC government loves Nigeria and committed to Nigeria, one project that they would have given to Nigeria is the creation of State police.\u201d\n\nWike explained that the beauty of establishing state police was to ensure that people indigenous to an area were engaged in policing their environment.\n\nWike told the delegates that he was presenting himself to them to be given the presidential ticket to fly the party\u2019s flag in the 2023 election because he was prepared to end the many troubles facing Nigeria.\n\nHe amented incidences of bomb blast in parts of the country and on railway tracks.\n\nTaraba Governor, Darius Ishaku harped the need for creation of state police.\n\nHe lamented the state of insecurity in Nigeria and expressed optimism that if PDP returned to power in 2023, the party would restore the lost glory of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe (Wike) speaks the truth, he fears nobody, and he is a workaholic. You have seen how he has turned Rivers State to a working site. We welcome him. We know what he has said, if God permits he will do it.\n\n\u201cNigeria is yearning for leadership. He has said it, hunger doesn\u2019t east, south or west. Kidnapping doesn\u2019t know south, east or west. Security is security. If there is no security there is no economy. If there is no economy, the country is not existing.\u201d\n\nOn his part, former Gombe Governor Ibrahim Dankwambo described Wike as a faithful party man with requisite experience to lead Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe is a true party man. Wike joined the party in 1998 and he is still in the party. He has never left even when the going was tough.\n\n\u201cWhen great people ran away, Wike stayed. He did not only stay, because he did not have anywhere to go, he contributed in building the party, in making the party stable and ensuring that the party continue as a growing concern.\n\n\u201cI have been to Rivers State while I was a governor, and have also been to Rivers State while I left as a governor. This is a man that has performed extremely very well. In education, health, social interaction of people and most importantly in security. In the area of security which is our major problem in Nigeria today, Wike has stabilise the Niger Delta today, particularly his own state of Rivers.\n\n\u201cYou can remember how Rivers was eight years ago and you see how Rivers has become one of the most visited states in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cCompanies are coming back, revenues have double, you know this is important in all the states, when you lost revenue because people are leaving. People have come back, investments have come back, development is in force.\u201d",

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) National Women Leader Dr Betta Edu has explained why the party pegged its presidential nomination form at N100m.\n\nShe said it was to shut out serious aspirants and prevent form syndication.\n\nThe party at its emergency extraordinary National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja on Wednesday announced N100m for the purchase of presidential nomination forms, the governorship form at N50m, Senate N20 million, House of Representatives, N10 million and House of Assembly for N2 million.\n\nShedding light on the cost of the forms, APC National Women Leader on \u2018Good Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE News Channel on Thursday in Abuja said it was a mechanism by the National Working Committee (NWC) to curtail the activities of some people who obtain forms just to constitute an hindrance in the entire electoral process.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cEverywhere around the world, running for elections has never been cheap and the party must be able to have means to guard several other issues that may arise.\n\n\u201cYou find people who are not interested in running for elections just standing up, picking up forms and just waiting to constitute a kind of barrier or put a sturd in the entire process as it goes on.\n\n\u201cThese are not things that we want to see as a party. We are the ruling party, the largest party in Africa, a party where if you pick their nomination form and you are the candidate, the probability of you becoming the elected person for that position is almost hundred percent.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot afford to dabble or joke around or gamble around. So, we want only serious people who are interested in running and representing different persons to run.\u201d\n\nShe also justified the cost of forms for the House of Assembly aspirants at N2m.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population. It\u2019s very fair and for women it\u2019s free, for disabled, it is free; for young people, it is 50 percent off, that\u2019s really very fair.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, going for the other positions, we know what it was before and what it is now and we are trying to prevent certain persons who sometimes are not the members of the party.\n\n\u201cThey just get their way in or they\u2019re being used as syndicates to pick up forms at the beginning to constitute a kind of clog in the way of the whole electoral process and they pull the party backwards.\u201d\n\nWhen challenged that over 98 percent of Nigerians cannot boast of N500,000 in their bank accounts in the face of the high cost of the party\u2019s nomination fee, the woman leader noted governorship and presidential elections are not all-comers affairs.\n\n\u201cSo, let me say this and say that very clearly. Coming to run for a governorship election is not an all-comers affair.\n\n\u201cGovernorship election is serious business, for you to run through all the local governments, consult people, reach out to people and indeed be able to campaign through the local governments requires a good amount of resources.\n\n\u201cAnd when you make up your mind that you want to run, you should be able to prepare adequately for that race.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there are many ways for young people to generate funding for elections. It must not be your money and they are not paying the same amount others are paying.\u201d",

So, one key thing to stop this insecurity in Nigeria is to have state police.\u201d\n\nHe said those opposing state police often argued that if allowed, governors would use it against their opponents.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

If this party called APC government loves Nigeria and committed to Nigeria, one project that they would have given to Nigeria is state police.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that the beauty of establishing state police is to ensure that people who are indigenous to an area are engaged in policing their environment.\n\nHe told the delegates that he was presenting himself to them to be given the presidential ticket to fly the party\u2019s flag in the 2023 election because he is prepared to end the many troubles facing Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria needs a leader who is forthright, can speak the truth always and competently be the Commander-in-Chief who goes to the field where Nigerians can relate with their daily experiences.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThe one problem that our (PDP) government (under me if elected) must solve is to bring down the level of insecurity in this country. Otherwise, there is no way the economy can grow.\n\n\u201cWhen bandits hear my name, they will run because I will take the war to them. I will be the Commander- in-Chief in action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be commanding in projects, in security, in agriculture and the economy together with the armed forces. I\u2019ll be commanding every aspects of life that will make Nigerians happy. This is because I have the capacity to solve the problems of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe visited victims of Tuesday\u2019s bomb blast at the Federal Medical Center Jalingo and promised to offset their medical bills.\n\nHe described such incidents including the operations of Boko Haram and bandits that have killed most Nigerians, as the legacy of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\nGovernor Darius Ishaku also lamented the state of insecurity and expressed optimism that if PDP returns to power in 2023, the party would restore the lost glory of the country.\n\n\u201cHe (Wike) speaks the truth, he fears nobody, and he is a workaholic. You have seen how he has turned Rivers State to a working site. We welcome him. We know what he has said, if God permits he will do it.\n\n\u201cNigeria is yearning for leadership. He has said it, hunger doesn\u2019t know East, South or West. Kidnapping doesn\u2019t know South, East or West. Security is security. If there is no security, there is no economy. If there is no economy, the country is not existing.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Gombe State Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo described Governor Wike as a faithful party man with requisite experience to lead Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe is a true party man. Wike joined the party in 1998 and he is still in the party. He has never left even when the going was tough. When great people ran away, Wike stayed. He did not only stay, because he did not have anywhere to go, he contributed in building the party, in making the party stable and ensuring that the party continue as a growing concern. I have been to Rivers State while I was a governor, and have also been to Rivers State while I left as a governor. This is a man that has performed extremely very well. In education, health, social interaction of people and most importantly in security.\u201d\n\nIn the area of security which is our major problem in Nigeria today, Wike has stabilised the Niger Delta today, particularly his own state of Rivers.",

          "title": "Rethink Your Policy on Fuel Subsidy, World Bank Tells Nigeria",
          "text": "\u2022Insists the rich benefit more from fuel subsidy than the poor\n\n\u2022Says barriers distorting country\u2019s trade flows\n\nObinna Chima in Washington DC and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\n\n\nThe President of the World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass has once more reiterated the need for Nigeria\u2019s federal government to reconsider its policy on fuel subsidy, saying that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled to other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass said this yesterday, while responding to a THISDAY question during a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC.\n\nThe Senate last week approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nThe World Bank had last November sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022. The Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, had painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy.\n\nBut speaking during the media briefing, Malpass pointed out that generalised subsidies have significant negatives effects on any system.\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, the World Bank boss reiterated the need for the country to do away with multiple exchange rate system, which according to him was often, \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there were a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help.\u201d\n\nMalpass noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows, urging the federal government to improve on this so as to help the country and its people move forward.\n\nCommenting on the spate of insecurity in the country, he said: \u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into to none Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stressed the need to boost agricultural productivity in Africa and get farmers to produce more, even as it noted that 20 countries in the region were either in debt distress or very close to debt distress.\n\nSpeaking at the opening press conference of the ongoing World Bank/IMF 2022 spring meetings holding virtually, the Managing Director of the Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the multilateral institution was working on debt restructuring for the affected countries.\n\nShe stated that the IMF and its partners had agreed on an action plan to address the situation.\n\n\u201cIn Sub Saharan Africa, 20 countries are in bed distress or very close to debt distress, with interest rates going up. This burden of debt is intolerable. So working to get that restructuring currently, this is a priority for us.

          "text": "\u2022Ayu to Amaechi: We don\u2019t want president that can run round stadium like Usain Bolt, but can\u2019t run railway transportation\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nAt the close of the submission of completed presidential nomination forms of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, 17 presidential aspirants were listed for further screening ahead of the party\u2019s primary elections.\n\nThe aspirants, who beat the deadline, were two-term governor of Kwara State and immediate past President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki; former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Speaker, House of Representatives, and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; former President of the Senate and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nOthers included former Minister of Federal Capital Territory and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; former Minister of State for Education and Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; outgoing Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel; 2019 PDP vice presidential candidate and former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi; former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose; United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; and media mogul, Dele Momodu.\n\nAlso successful were Investment banker and economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa; former Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly, Cosmos Ndukwe; Charles Ugwu; as well as the only female aspirant in the race, Tareila Diana.\n\nThe party realised N640 million from the 16 male presidential aspirants and N6 million from the only female presidential aspirant, Diana, making the revenue generated N646 million.\n\nNational Organising Secretary of PDP, Bature Umar, in a statement, said the screening of presidential aspirants would commence April 27, while the governorship aspirants would be screened on April 26.\n\nUmar also said the House of Representatives, senatorial, and House of Assembly aspirants would be screened on April 25, while appeals by those dissatisfied with the screening exercise would commence on April 25 for House of Assembly, while that for House of Representatives and Senate would take place on April 27.\n\nAppeals from governorship aspirants would be addressed on April 29, and the presidential appeal committee would hear appeals from dissatisfied presidential aspirants on April 30, the statement said.\n\nIt said the process of selection of ad hoc delegates for the election of candidates would commence April 23, to be followed by ward congress on April 26.\n\nIn the revised timetable, local government congresses would take place nationwide on April 29, while the local government appeal committees would hear appeals from the election of the ad hoc delegates on May 2.\n\nDelegates\u2019 list would be published on May 5, while the nomination congress of the House of Representatives and Senate would take place May 12 and May 14, respectively.\n\nThe appeals would take place on May 18, while the governorship primaries would be held on May 24, with the appeals following on May 25. The presidential convention of PDP is expected to hold on May 29 and 30.\n\nYesterday, also, the Akwa Ibom State governor addressed the party\u2019s NWC on his presidential aspiration, likening the 2023 presidential election to a war, and required an experienced politician to carry the APC presidential ticket.\n\nEmmanuel stated, \u201cJust to let the party know that we are challenged as a nation. The party is about going to war. And if you want to go to war, you cannot leave your generals and start dealing with recruits.\n\n\u201cYou have the generals in your team and we\u2019re ready to march on to victory. And I\u2019m trying to let you know that if you will look around the country today, there are issues in Nigeria, so people want to see those that will bring solutions and not create more problems.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigeria was challenged, \u201cBecause this is a country that you\u2019d woke up one morning, if care is not taken, you wouldn\u2019t have stories to tell our children. You come into the scene, you play the politics, with all your knowledge, with all your experience, with all the education, with all your exposure, how come you didn\u2019t try, you didn\u2019t even offer to serve your country?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be questioned like that in the next generation. So, today, I\u2019m standing as one of those that have solution to economic issues. So, the solution for Nigeria, first of all, is to try and rescue our economic values in this country. I don\u2019t want to go so much about the infrastructure, because that one, once you can rescue, with that you can actually reconstruct and restore the infrastructure that has decayed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday took a swipe at Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, a presidential aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), for his alleged inability to manage the railway system in the country. Speaking after Emmanuel had briefed the party on his presidential aspiration, Ayu said Nigeria desired trusted and tested politicians, like the Akwa Ibom State governor, to manage the affairs of the country.\n\nAyu stated, in a veiled reference to Amaechi, \u201cWe don\u2019t want presidential aspirants, who can run round the stadium, like Usain Bolt, but cannot run a railway station.\u201d\n\nHe compared the presidential aspirants of the party to those of APC, saying all of them are qualified to run the affairs of the country better than President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAyu advised the PDP presidential aspirants to take their campaigns to the delegates, as their votes would decide the 2023 presidential candidate of the party. He also warned against mudslinging during electioneering campaigns, saying such would give the opposition ammunition to attack the party.\n\n\u201cCampaigns would be issue-based and not attacking each other or mudslinging,\u201d the PDP national chairman said. He pledged that the party would conduct a transparent and fair presidential convention, as it had no preferred candidate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He asked me to sit down and he asked me the reason why the road was blocked. Then I told him that I didn\u2019t really know and heard that it was all about the appointment of the new VC.\n\n\u201cHe decided to leave the office immediately and he packed his things saying that I was God-sent to him because it was almost 2 pm and he needed to pick up his son from school. He carried the bag and we were about to leave the office. I offered to help him with the bag but he declined and I headed to the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me from behind and held me so tight. At this point, I was in shock, then he said and I quote, \u2018Mo fe\u0301 k\u00ed \u00e8mi \u00e0ti e jo w\u00e0 papo\u0300 ni [thrice] but problem t\u00ed mo n\u00ed tele\u0300 ni boy Ajibade yen but mi \u00f2 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f3 ye k\u00f3 je\u0301 problem mo\u0301- (I want the two of us to be together (three times), but the problem I had before was that boy called Ajibade, but I don\u2019t think he should pose any challenge again.\n\n\u201cHe then stood up from the chair still forcefully holding me and dragged me to the couch in his office. By this time, he had already pulled down his trousers and brought out his erect pen*s.\n\n\u201cHe grabbed my right hand, and used it to rub his pen*s. It happened so quickly that I was petrified. He continued to do this and I was so distressed by the entire situation that I lost count of time.\u201d\n\nReacting to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, Abiodun Olanrewaju, OAU\u2019s spokesman, dismissed allegations that the institution was foot-dragging in sanctioning the embattled professor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlanrewaju said a prima facie has been established against the professor, adding that the institution would announce its sanction in due course.\n\n\u201cThe unwholesome incident, which happened on March 18, 2022, prompted Boluwatife Hannah Bababunmi of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages, to write a petition to the university management against Joseph Ayo Opefeyitimi, a professor of Yoruba Incantations and Stylistics, of the same department, on March 21, 2022,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cProcedurally, after the receipt of the formal complaints, the first step was that the departmental committee sat on the matter and, after thorough investigation, Professor Opefeyitimi was found prima facie liable.\n\n\u201cSecond stage was the faculty level and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Professor Niyi Okunoye, referred the matter to the anti-sexual harassment committee of the university. The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the university management.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOf course, the university administration would have to present its recommendations to the governing council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars Seier Christensen, Chairman, Concordium Foundation and founder of Seier Capital, met with some stakeholders in the blockchain, financial, and tech space in an exclusive event held at Four Points by Sheraton on Thursday, April 14.\n\nThe much-anticipated event had notable personalities in the Nigeria tech and blockchain space, including influencers.\n\nLars Seier Christensen gave a lecture touching on the blockchain, the internet, Concordium blockchain, and investing, among others.\n\nHis talk stressed that the Concordium blockchain is big on compliance and working with regulators because he believes that blockchain technology regulation is inevitable.\n\nHe said regulators couldn\u2019t have worked for many years to regulate the traditional financial systems just to watch them get dismantled without fighting back or trying to regulate them.\n\n\u201cThis opens up for a new transformation of the economy because it can both make a lot of existing processes much more safe, much more efficient, much more secure, much more trustworthy,\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars said that there will be entirely newer business models built based on blockchain. Cryptocurrencies, coins, and tokens are not blockchain\u2019s major focus or use case. The important thing about blockchain is blockchain.\n\nYou only need your tokens to encourage some things happening on the blockchain because you need a very efficient and quick means of payment. Normal foreign exchanges cannot meet that requirement at this point, and if they could, there probably won\u2019t be the need for this technology.\n\nAccording to Lars, cryptocurrencies have taken much of the attention away from what blockchain is really about: improving your business model, keeping your data safe, and ensuring that people do what they agreed to do.\n\nHe raised concerns about the anonymity in the blockchain and why it can be dangerous. From his experience in the traditional financial systems, regulators work to protect people from those who are smarter and more knowledgeable than them in the financial market or protect them from getting into something that they didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cI think that for blockchain to be successful, it has to respect those aspects of a normal society that are exactly the same. You don\u2019t want it to be possible to cheat people who don\u2019t understand it, and there is a need to hold people accountable for bad behaviour and prevent vices like terror financing, money laundering, and so on.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lars, the basic premise of concordium is a blockchain that has a better balance between privacy and accountability than an average blockchain. The bottom line is that it is built to be able to provide the building blocks for the regulations that will surely come.\n\nAnother important thing to remember about concordium is that it is a layer one infrastructural blockchain such as Ethereum, and it is something you can build your user base upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use cases for blockchain are immense, and one of the use cases of a well-built blockchain is the preservation of data. Another strong use case for blockchain is the registration of ownership.\n\nLars also highlighted the importance of educating one\u2019s self about the blockchain and its many use cases to make informed decisions. Interestingly, according to Mr Lars, the good news is that the blockchain is not very complicated.\n\nGiving reasons for investing in the African continent, he cited that the continent has a relatively young population, which according to him, is a good thing because it is far better to have more younger people than older generations.\n\nIt is a huge benefit, and he believes it is important to educate the young generation on business, economics, technology, and understanding of society because the higher the level of education of a society, the higher their prosperity.\n\nIt is important to educate them so they can take on the opportunities that present themselves.\n\nLars is very optimistic about the future of Africa and Nigeria.\n\nHe advised that people should look into the blockchain and keep themselves informed.\n\nHe added, \u201cI look to invest in Nigeria thanks to its thriving tech culture that seems to be here.\u201d\n\nAnswering a question bordering regulation of crypto in Nigeria, he said it\u2019s important to distinguish between what is speculative crypto and what is not. Most people lose money when they trade speculatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting an example of European Regulators recognising that blockchain is important for growing the economy, and they want protection against the abuses of crypto, and that\u2019s a balance that is needed to be found.\n\nHowever, he admitted to having little or no influence on lifting the ban on crypto in Nigeria.\n\nThere seems to be a focus on the negatives or things that could go wrong. However, Lars hopes that people see the positives and things can come out that will help transparency, efficiency and grow the economy, inclusive to many people. All these have to be balanced against restricting abuse.\n\nConcordium is a blockchain that\u2019s compliance-ready with today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s economies.\n\nIt is a science-based proof-of-stake blockchain created for all, with unique business applications in mind.\n\nThe blockchain has identification built into the protocol to meet regulatory requirements while delivering a user-friendly platform that can handle smart contracts.

          "text": "At least 14.5 million Nigerians are facing acute food insecurity, largely due to persisting insecurity and the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) disclosed on Thursday.\n\nNkeiru Enwelum, Nutrition officer, UNICEF who disclosed this, stated that the situation is worsening the burden of malnutrition, adding that Nigeria is at risk of back-sliding on of the gains made on nutrition and achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)on zero hunger by 2030.\n\nEnwelum stated this at a media dialogue on SDGs as child rights with a focus on malnutrition organised by the Child Rights Information Bureau (CRIB) of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture in collaboration with UNICEF in Enugu.\n\nQuoting latest statistics, Enwelum disclosed that Nigeria did not make any progress on the SDG nutrition targets since 2015 as the country has remained the country with the highest number of malnourished children in Africa and second highest in the world.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, Nigeria has 35 million children under the age of five. Out of which, 14 million are stunted, 3 million are wasted and 24 million are anaemic due to poor nutrition.\n\nThe data also shows that 45 percent of deaths in children under the age of five is caused by malnutrition, and Nigeria loses 15 percent of her GDP annually to the burden.\n\nChidi Ezinwa, a public health expert from Enugu State University of Science and Technology speaking at the dialogue, expressed concerns that Nigeria may continue to lag on nutrition targets and the overall SDG goals.\n\nRead also: Over 11, 000 schools shut down in Nigeria since 2020 \u2013 UNICEF\n\n\u201cWe are making a backward movement. In 2019 we ranked 159th, in 2020, we ranked 160th, but before that time, there was no crisis in different parts of the country. Now that we have this crisis situation, it is reasonable to think that malnutrition will be on the increase because you can\u2019t separate conflict from malnutrition and hunger. Given the situation we are not likely to make any progress,\u201d he said.\n\nEzinwa stressed that SDGs cannot be realised without recognising and fulfilling the rights of children. The expert however regretted that rising poverty and hunger is denying children of some of their basic rights, such as the right to quality healthcare, and education, among others.\n\nThe expert disclosed that more than 70 percent of Nigerian children live in poverty and 23.3 percent live in extreme poverty.\n\n\u201cThe SDG index shows that many rights of children are yet to be fulfilled in Nigeria. Hence, Nigeria is far from realising the SDGs . Children are not objects rather they are human beings and individuals with their own rights. A sustainable future depends on how we meet the needs of children and young people, \u201d he stressed.\n\nGeoffrey Njoku, communication specialist, UNICEF warned that malnutrition should not be treated as a northern problem.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nDivine providence did a lot in the life of great men in the world, men who make up their minds to make great impact and to stand out in their fields of learning no matter what.\n\nThe is the story of a young boy who dreamt of building world class Hospital and Medical Clinics in Africa that will be accessible to all. People in Africa especially Nigeria will be able to enjoy good Healthcare facilities.\n\nIndeed, good things are achieved through hard work, determination, resilience and perseverance in order to thread the path of honour. Yes, success is not for lazy men but for the hardworking and intelligent once. All these statements could best be used to describe the personality of Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty who became an achiever through seriousness and steadfastness, making his way to progress and greatness in the field of Medicine.\n\nMeeting Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty, MD CEO and Chief Medical Officer Centralmed Urgent and Primary Care, Founder, Lebarty Medical PLLC, President, Project Health Africa for the first time gives one the impression that this young and vibrant Medical doctor knows exactly what he is doing and want to do.\n\nThe Health situation in Nigeria is gradually turning into something else; hence the need for this young Edo man reaching out to the people requires commendation.\n\nHearing Dr Nosa speak about his passion and dreams for the African man especially his place of birth (Edo State), one will begin to wonder. Dr Nosa has an evidence based holistic approach and training in urgent care, primary care and specialized addiction Medicine. He has more than 20 years of combined experience in medical treatment; he is setting up a world class hospital in Africa that will be accessible to all and give people in Africa access to quality Healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, he saw that a lot of people especially the elderly and children find it difficult to access the health facilities mostly because of funds. And as a medical doctor in the US (United States of America) he has seen the way the medical Healthcare is done here in Africa so different from the way it\u00eds done abroad. That is the reason why he is coming to build a hospital in Benin City and nearby villages. And as a general Practitioner, he said he decided to come home to help the people. Dr. Nosa said what is driving his desire to build this project is his love and passion for the place of his birth, Edo State Nigeria where his heart is.\n\nA proud Bini man, he feels concern about the less privileged, knowing fully well that in Africa, the first thing people worry about is what to eat instead of taking care of their health, just as the saying goes that \u00ecHealth is Wealth\u00ee.\n\nThat is why he wants to set up a hospital where people can afford to go and get what they need to help their condition health wise. According to Dr. Nosa, another significant part of his hospital is to take care of the old and elderly. He said that section will be named after his grandmother. Most of the old and elderly who have children overseas usually don\u00edt like or want to travel and so at the end of the day house helps are hired to attend to their needs. But most people prefers institutions like the care home because some of these hired helps don\u00edt usually take adequate care of them. But if institutions like a care home attached to the hospital is provided, the aged can have a place to stay, where they will be well taken care of by professionals including their medical care and everything they need. The goal according to Dr. Nosa is to inspire the people.\n\nThe monetary aspect to be able to access the Facility will be very minimal compared to what is presently paid in our health institutions. And the reason according to Dr. Nosa is because of maintenance to keep the place going.\n\nThe good thing about this project is that the state governor Mr. Godwin Obaseki is seriously interested in investors coming in to the state to develop it. Anything that will help make Edo State shine out to the world is what brings joy to the governor and people of the state, Edo state is going to be great again.\n\nAs the dream becomes a reality, the people of Edo State are waiting patiently to welcome and be part of this wonderful Healthcare facilities which Dr. Nosa Aigbe lebarty will use to bring hope to the hopeless and courage to the downtrodden to now be able to access health care in improved standard of health facilities in the state.\n\nIndeed, it is a welcome development.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria\u2019s former president, has called for state police, noting that it has become necessary in view of the country\u2019s growing security challenges.\n\nThe former president spoke when the leadership of the National Association of Ex-local government chairmen in Nigeria paid him a courtesy visit in Abeokuta on Wednesday.\n\nA statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, hinted the visit was led by the pioneer National chairman, Hon. Albert Asipa; the Ogun State chapter Chairman, Rt. Hon. Shoyemi Coker; Hon. Chinwe Monu-Olarewaju (Delta State) (Chairman BOT) and the traditional ruler of Odogbolu, His Royal Highness, Oba (Dr) Toye Mojeed Alatise; Gbegande of Ososa, a former chairman of Ijebu Ode local government area of Ogun State, among others.\n\nObasanjo, who commended the initiative behind the formation of the body, said that the development clearly showed that some local chairmen in the country were better than even the top elected leaders.\n\nThe former President while responding to one of the speakers, Chinwe Monu-Olarewaju\u2019s submission on creation of community police to curb the wave of insecurity, quipped that the idea needed to be changed.\n\n\u201cOur situation in Nigeria concerns everyone, particularly, the case of terrorism. The case has gotten over the issue of community police. It is now State police. It is from that State Police that we can now be talking about community police,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke on the need to strengthen the traditional system and the local government administration, \u201cwhich I prepared during the popular Murtala/Obasanjo administration, because I believe that there is need to enable that tier of government to work truly as a local government. They have their own executive, judiciary and legislature.\n\n\u201cThey were working and they were very visible, building and managing roads, looking into education, health, local administration, agriculture, but they were all gone,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe said that the experience the former chairmen had in local government administration was enough to aspire for higher posts, stressing that some of them have the competence, ability and integrity to get to these posts.\n\nObasanjo, who was presented with a letter of a life patron, assured that he would look into their request, assuring further that he would be available on request for their needs at all times.\n\nAshipa had earlier told the former President why they decided to come together in all the 774 local governments in the country, declaring, \u201cwe can also contribute to the economy and political developments of the country.\n\n\u201cAnd realising your position as father of local government in Nigeria, we need you to actualize our goals, hence this all important visit. And to come and say happy 85th birthday celebrations. \u201d\n\nOthers present were Hon. Abayomi Tella (National Organising Secretary), Hon. Garba Fatai Adeniyi (National Auditor), Hon. Ayantoye Adekunle (State Chairman, Osun State), Hon Tajudeen Oke (State Chairman, Oyo State), Hon. Akinwunmi Sowore (State Chairman, Ondo State), Hon Ogidi Akindele (State Chairman, Ekiti State) and Hon Nicholas Akinbiola (Ondo State).\n\nThey also include, Hon.

Muhammadu Buhari, now President and leader of the APC, told Nigerians that he had to borrow N27m to buy his nomination form. The same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100m! I am told that\u2019s an increase of N370 percent.\n\n\u201cBut in 2014, the PDP was in power and the economy was still booming. The incompetent APC presidency has now run the economy aground, making Nigeria the \u201cPoverty Capital of the World.\u201d How then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached \u201cEqual Opportunity\u201d to them.\n\n\u201cBy this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths who applauded President Buhari when he signed the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018. It is most insensitive, and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100m and N50m nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\n\n\u201cWe, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.\u201d",

Otti OFR, for his tenacity and purposeful commitment towards the liberation of Abia people.\n\n\u201cFor over 20 years, Abia has remained in the vice grip of fiendish and heartless group of people who arrested and imprisoned the development of the State, and castrated the hopes and lives of our people, through the rudderless and reprehensible rulership of the State, riding on the anti-people Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) train,\u201d AFA lamented in the statement.\n\nThe group praised Otti, a former Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the erstwhile Diamond Bank Plc, now Access Bank, for being the most important opposition voice in Abia politics and not relenting in his effort at holding the state government to account.\n\nAccording to AFA, \u201cWe believe Otti, when he said during his declaration of interest for the governorship of Abia State, that he will free Abia from their slave Masters. We also believe him when he said he will fast track the development of the State in all sectors of her economy, pay off years of arrears of salaries, pensions, gratuities, and rededicate the State back to God, as God\u2019s Own State.\n\n\u201cWe believe him because he has records of achievement in the private sector where he came from. As a former Chief Executive Officer of a financial institution, he took the organisation, a literally family concern, to its enviable glorious height, where it became the fifth most systemic important bank, out of over 20 banks, in Nigeria. He was also to become Chairman of the Bankers Committee, an umbrella association of chief executives of banks in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe him because through his Alex Otti Foundation, he has been able to train and empower Abia youths and women, through award of university scholarships, skill acquisitions and granting of loans to small and micro enterprises.\n\n\u201cA first-class economist and philanthropist, Otti is the kind of leader Abia State needs at this time; a humane and purposeful leader, equipped with the right kind of intellect, who not only understands what it takes but has the mental energy, political will, national and global connection and above all the fear of God, to execute the tasks of rebuilding Abia and moving the state forward.\n\n\u201cWe call on all truly progressive and light-filled Abians and friends of Abia, to join us and build great alliances in support of this divine mandate, as we support Dr Alex Otti, for the freedom of a people who have been so rapaciously raped over the years that they have lost both hope and consciousness.\u201d",

The case has gotten over the issue of community police. It is now state police. It is from that state police that we can now be talking about community police,\u201d Obasanjo explained.\n\nThe former president also advocated for the need to strengthen the traditional leadership system and the local government administration in Nigeria, \u201cwhich I prepared during the popular Murtala/Obasanjo administration\u201d, stressing that he was of the strong belief that \u201csuch tier of government to work truly as a local government, they have their own Executive, Judiciary and Legislature\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey were working and they were very visible, building and managing roads, looking into education, health, local administration, agriculture, but they were all gone,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe said that the experience the former chairmen had in local government administration was enough to aspire for higher posts, stressing that some of them have the competence, ability and integrity to get to these posts.\n\nObasanjo, who was presented with a letter of appointment as a Life Patron of the group, assured that he would look into their request, assuring further that he would be available on request for their needs at all times.",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State governor and a PDP presidential aspirant, Nyesom Wike, on Thursday said if elected as President, he will take the war to bandits, saying that when they hear his name, they will run away.\n\nHe also said the establishment of a State police would be one enduring approach to addressing the festering insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nWike, while wooing delegates of PDP in Taraba State when he met with them in Jalingo on Thursday, dismissed the argument against the need for State Police.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, you cannot stop this insecurity if you don\u2019t have state police. You must have state police, there are no two ways about it. Having state police does not mean you will not have federal police. All over the federal system, even councils have their own police so that you employ people who know the environment.\n\n\u201cYou cannot take a stranger to go to Mambila, it will take him years to understand that place. You can\u2019t take a stranger and go to Donga or Chanchangi. So, you need people who know the environment so they will be able to take care of the place.\n\n\u201cIf federal offences are committed, the federal police should handle them. If they are state offences, the state police should handle them. So one key thing to stop this insecurity in Nigeria is to have state police,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rivers State governor said those opposing state police often argue that if allowed, state governors would use it against their opponents.\n\n\u201cThe question is, will the governors be in office permanently? So, that argument is neither here nor there. If this party called the APC government loves Nigeria and is committed to Nigeria, one project that they would have given to Nigeria is the creation of State police.\u201d\n\nWike explained that the beauty of establishing a State police is to ensure that people who are indigenous in an area are engaged in policing their environment.\n\nWike told the delegates that he was presenting himself to them to be given the presidential ticket to fly the party\u2019s flag in the 2023 election because he is prepared to end the many troubles facing Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria needs a leader who is forthright, could speak the truth always and competently be the Commander-in-Chief who goes to the field where Nigerians could relate their daily experiences to him.\n\n\u201cThe one problem that our (PDP) government, (under me if elected) must solve is to bring down the level of insecurity in this country, otherwise there is no way the economy can grow.\n\n\u201cWhen bandits hear my name, they will run because I will take the war to them. I will be the Commander-in-Chief in action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be commanding projects in security, agriculture and the economy together with the armed forces. I\u2019ll be commanding every aspect of life that will make Nigerians happy. This is because I have the capacity to solve the problems of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWike lamented the incidences of the bomb blast in parts of the country and on railway tracks.\n\nHe described such incidents, including the operations of Boko Haram and bandits that have killed most Nigerians as the legacy of the APC federal government.\n\nSimilarly, the Taraba State governor, Darius Ishaku also harped on the need for the creation of state police.\n\nHe lamented the state of insecurity in Nigeria and expressed optimism that if the PDP returned to power in 2023, the party would restore the lost glory of the country.",

The answer is a big \u2018no\u2019. The three cardinal issues upon which Nigeria gave us a mandate in 2015 are infrastructure/economic development, security and anti-corruption. In properly assessing this government and our programmes, it is important we start from where we met Nigeria in 2015.\n\n\u201cIn obedience to your will and results gathered in my consultations, we are going to vie for the post of president of the federal republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSo many strikes by labour unions were recorded under Ngige as Minister of Labour and Employment including the ongoing industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities which entered its 66th day today (Thursday).\n\nASUU had on Monday, February 14, 2022, announced a four-week total and comprehensive warning strike following the inability of the union and the Nigerian Government to reach common ground on the demands of the university lecturers.\n\nSome of ASUU\u2019s demands include the release of revitalisation funds for universities, renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement, release of earned allowances for university lecturers, and deployment of the UTAS payment platform for the payment of salaries and allowances of university lecturers.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the initial four-week warning strike, the union had gone ahead to declare additional eight weeks of industrial action, saying that it was giving the government more time to attend to its needs.",

Every Zone of the six Zones in Nigeria is represented and from one female member, we now have three female members of the Board.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the founders of the FMBN in the 1970s, envisaged to create a Bank, in every sense of the word and it was intended to do only one thing, \u2018to provide Mortgage Banking services.\u2019\n\nAccording to Fashola, \u201call of these are self-evident from Section 1(i) where it was provided that:(i) There is hereby established a Mortgage Bank to be known as the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (in this Act referred to as \u201cthe Mortgage Bank\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Section 5 of the Act the functions of the Mortgage Bank are set out clearly as follows: \u201cThe functions of the Mortgage Bank shall be to: a) provide long-term credit facilities to mortgage institutions in Nigeria at such rates and such terms as may be determined by the Board in accordance with the policy by the Federal Government, being rates and terms designed to enable the mortgage institutions to grant comparable facilities to Nigerian individuals desiring to acquire houses of their own; b) license and encourage the emergence and growth of the required number of viable secondary mortgage institutions to service the need of housing delivery in all parts of Nigeria; c) encourage and promote the development of mortgage institutions at rural, Local, State and Federal levels; d) supervise and control the activities of mortgage institutions in Nigeria; e) collect, manage and administer the National Housing Fund in accordance with the provisions of the National Housing Fund Act; and f) do anything and enter into any transaction which in the opinion of the Board is necessary to ensure the proper performance of its functions under this Act.\n\nThe Minister however, assured the board that the Ministry will give it every reasonable and lawful support but will not hesitate this time to recommend to Mr. President, the removal of any nominee who falls short of the standards, or becomes a problem.\n\n\u201cIn other words, your tenure of four years on the Board and five years on the Management Committee are not guaranteed but subject to performance.\u201d He said.\n\nHe also drew the attention of the Board to the completion of the over 2,000 Housing Units at various levels of completion under the Ministerial Pilot Housing Scheme.\n\nHe also said that as a creature of Law, members are forbidden from making the Bank do anything that the Law does not authorize it to do, \u201cand you can become individually and corporately liable for non-compliance with the Law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has become the important starting point for my inauguration remarks because in the tenure of previous Boards and Managements before this Administration, the Bank has been made to do things the Law did not contemplate and this has resulted in hobbling liabilities which I regret to inform you that you must now confront and resolve.\u201d\n\nFashola further craved the Management and Board to bring to a Lawful end, all other ventures into which the Bank has dabbled which are not supported by Law.\n\n\u201cI expect this to happen through due process, supported by Legal consultations, Board debates and decisions and Ministerial or Presidential approvals as may be necessary.\u201d He stated.",

We are not happy that SON is not allowed to operate at its maximum capacity especially with their presence being felt at the port.\n\n\u201cNigeria is import dependent with porous borders and for them not to be at the port to inspect these goods first hand is not good enough. They should be allowed to be at the port to see these products before they enter into the market\u201d, he said.\n\nRecall, that years ago ,the Standard Organization of Nigeria has vacated the seaports, the intention of the government is to allow the Agency do the role of regulation outside the ports.\n\nHowever, the increase in the imports of sub-standard goods and the effort of some freethinker have shown that there is need to reverse this executive decision inorder to win the war against importation of sub-standard goods in Nigeria.\n\nAlso a stakeholder, Mr Yinka Adegboyega called on the managers of the economy to bring SON back to the nation\u2019s seaports, adding that this is the easiest and safest way to stop these goods from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cThese goods are better checked at the ports not in the markets. Dealing in fake and substandard products is a crime to humanity and poses great danger for the nation\u2019s economy, as a result of this, we must collaborate with SON to collectively fight this battle against a substandard goods. We were not doing this before, but the new SON boss has told us and convinced us that this is the only way out to stamp out these goods. We have seen his desires and commitment to fighting this war and we need to contribute our own quota by lending our support to SON\u201d he said.",

Albert Asipa, the Ogun State chapter Chairman, Rt. Hon. Shoyemi Coker, Hon. Chinwe Monu-Olarewaju (Delta State) (Chairman BOT) and the traditional ruler of Odogbolu, His Royal Highness, Oba (Dr) Toye Mojeed Alatise, Gbegande of Ososa, a former chairman of Ijebu Ode local government area of Ogun State among others.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Meets Service Chiefs, Ministers In Abuja\n\nObasanjo, who commended the initiative behind the formation of the body, said that the development clearly showed that some local chairmen in the country were better than even the top elected leaders.\n\nThe former President while responding to one of the speakers, Chinwe Monu-Olarewaju\u2019s submission on creation of community police to curb the wave of insecurity quipped that the idea needed to be changed.\n\n\u201cOur situation in Nigeria concerns everyone, particularly, the case of terrorism. The case has gotten over the issue of community police. It is now State police. It is from that State Police that we can now be talking about community police,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke on the need to strengthen the traditional system and the local government administration, \u201cwhich I prepared during the popular Murtala/Obasanjo administration, because I believe that there is need to enable that tier of government to work truly as a local governmen. They have their own Executive, Judiciary and Legislature.\n\n\u201cThey were working and they were very visible, building and managing roads, looking into education, health, local administration, agriculture, but they were all gone,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe said that the experience the former chairmen had in local government administration was enough to aspire for higher posts, stressing that some of them have the competence, ability and integrity to get to these posts.\n\nObasanjo, who was presented with a letter of a life patron, assured that he would look into their request, assuring further that he would be available on request for their needs at all times.\n\nAshipa had earlier told the former President why they decided to come together in all the 774 local governments in the country, declaring, \u201cwe can also contribute to the economy and political developments of the country.\n\n\u201cAnd realising your position as father of local government in Nigeria, we need you to actualize our goals, hence this all important visit.

Former President Andrej Kiska and Boris Koll\u00e1r, the current speaker of Slovakia\u2019s parliament, are among those accused of using confidential tax information to run smear campaigns against them.\n\nFico was accused of being the leader of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that includes former police director Tibor Gap\u00e1r and Slovak oligarch Norbert Bodor, according to the indictment.\n\nHe stood for president in 2014, while serving his second term as Prime Minister of Slovakia, but was defeated by Kiska by nearly 20 percentage points.

The release of thousands of private messages between Kuciak\u2019s alleged killers and police, judges, and ruling-coalition politicians galvanized voters, propelling the anti-corruption Ordinary People movement to power in 2020.",

          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron cleared a major hurdle on the path to re-election with a combative TV debate performance against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen that convinced most viewers, a poll said, even if he was still deemed arrogant.\n\nAlthough Le Pen came across as more polished and composed than in a TV duel for the presidency in 2017, Macron went on the offensive over her ties to Russian leadership, her plans for the economy and her policy for the European Union.\n\nWith the deciding vote just four days away, some 59% of viewers found Macron to have been the most convincing in the debate, according to a snap poll for BFM TV. That suggested the almost three-hour showdown would not alter the course of the election, with Macron ahead in all previous polls.\n\nVoter surveys have shown a widening of Macron\u2019s lead over Le Pen to as much as 56%-44% since the first round on April 10, and analysts said the debate was unlikely to swing voting intentions in Le Pen\u2019s favour.\n\n\u201cYes, Emmanuel Macron won but his adversary has avoided a repeat of last time\u2019s disaster,\u201d Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador said on Twitter. \u201cThis debate doesn\u2019t disqualify her like the one in 2017, but it doesn\u2019t help her close the gap either.\u201d\n\nOn the offensive for most of the debate, Macron\u2019s most piercing line of attack was on a loan to Le Pen\u2019s party for her 2017 campaign contracted through a Russian bank.\n\n\u201cYou talk about your banker when you talk about Russia, that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Macron told his opponent. \u201cYou depend on Russian power, you depend on Mr. Putin.\u201d read more\n\nOn the cost of living, rated the most important issue for the French in this election, Macron also appeared to put Le Pen on the defensive, asking her why she had voted against his plans to cap electricity prices if she wanted to help hard-up workers.\n\nStill, during the debate Macron failed to dispel an image of haughtiness that has taken root during his presidency. He interrupted his rival repeatedly with lines like \u201cMrs Le Pen is much more disciplined than five years ago\u201d, and \u201cStop mixing everything up\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr Macron, stop lecturing me,\u201d Le Pen retorted. By contrast, she adopted a much more courteous and softer tone than in 2017, even going so far as to applaud Macron\u2019s diplomatic efforts to prevent war in Ukraine.\n\nAn Elabe snap opinion poll on each candidate\u2019s personal characteristics showed 50% of the French thought Macron had come across as arrogant during the debate, while only 16% thought Le Pen had.\n\nLe Pen also appeared marginally more in tune with regular citizens, with 37% of viewers saying she sounded closer to people\u2019s concerns, while only 34% thought Macron did.\n\nShe also delivered a memorable punchline, which may resonate with left-wing and younger voters who think Macron has not done enough to combat climate change, despite his early-mandate slogan \u201cMake our planet great again\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am not a climate sceptic, but you\u2019re a bit of a climate hypocrite,\u201d Le Pen quipped.\n\nBut Macron\u2019s mastery of policy details made him look more \u201cpresidential\u201d, the same Elabe poll showed, while she failed to convince a majority of viewers she was fit to govern.\n\n\u201cEach of them has a huge weakness,\u201d Bernard Sananes of pollster Elabe said. \u201cEmmanuel Macron is considered arrogant by more than one in two viewers. And Marine Le Pen remains scary for half of them.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Putin Tells Forces Not to Storm Ukraine Holdout in Mariupol",
          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city of Mariupol on Thursday but instead to block it \u201cso that not even a fly comes through.\u201d\n\nHis defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the rest of the city beyond the sprawling Azovstal steel plant where Ukrainian forces were holed has been \u201cliberated\u201d \u2014 as Russian officials refer to areas of Ukraine they have seized. Putin hailed that as a \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nBut leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol, which has seen some of the most dramatic fighting of the war and whose capture has both strategic and symbolic importance.\n\nThe scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point, and its definitive fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nShoigu said the plant was \u201csecurely blocked.\u201d\n\nPutin and Shoigu\u2019s comments appeared to reflect a change in strategy in Mariupol, where the Russians previously seemed determined to take every last inch of the city. But it was not clear what it would mean in practical terms.\n\nUkrainian officials did not comment on the latest remarks, but earlier said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remain the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol would be made Thursday \u2014 though it was not clear how the latest comments would affect that.\n\nIn Kyiv, Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Denmark\u2019s Mette Frederiksen became the latest European leaders to show support with a visit to the capital. They were due to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in a video address overnight that the Russians were not \u201cabandoning their attempts to score at least some victory by launching a new, large-scale offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe West stands together to support the Ukrainian people,\u201d Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians\u2019 new drive to seize the industrial east.\n\nBritain\u2019s Defense Ministry said in an assessment that Russia likely desires to demonstrate significant successes ahead of its annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations. \u201cThis could affect how quickly and forcefully they attempt to conduct operations in the run-up to this date.\u201d\n\nAs fears grew for the fate of civilians in Mariupol, the Kyiv regional police said Thursday that two mass graves with nine bodies were discovered in the city of Borodyanka, northwest of the capital. The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians.\n\nHead of the Kyiv regional police, Andriy Nebytov, said two women and a teenager were among the \u201ccivilians killed by the Russian occupiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to stress that these people are civilians. The Russian military deliberately shot civilians that didn\u2019t put up any resistance and didn\u2019t pose any threat,\u201d Nebytov said, adding that some of the victims were apparently tortured.\n\nWith global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. President Vladimir Putin boasted that it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia \u201cthink twice.\u201d The head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia \u201ca present to NATO.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon described the test as \u201croutine\u201d and said it wasn\u2019t considered a threat.\n\nOn the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces were advancing from staging areas in the Donbas toward Kramatorsk, which continues to suffer from persistent rocket attacks.\n\nThe Luhansk governor said Russian forces control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region.\n\nGov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately.\n\n\u201cThe occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,\u201d Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nAnalysts have said the offensive in the east could become a war of attrition as Russia faces Ukraine\u2019s most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years.\n\nRussia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict \u2014 days after Putin said the talks were at a \u201cdead end.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cthe ball is in their court, we\u2019re waiting for a response.\u201d He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or whether it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month.\n\nZelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it.\n\nMoscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine said the Russians dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the Azovstal steel plant .\n\nA few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians\u2019 estimate, remained in the plant and its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers spread out across about 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). Zelenskyy said about 1,000 civilians were also trapped.\n\nA Ukrainian apparently in the plant posted a Facebook video urging world leaders to help evacuate people from the plant, saying, \u201cWe have more than 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nThe officer identified himself as Serhiy Volynskyy of the 36th Marine Brigade and warned: \u201cThis may be our last appeal.

The city\u2019s pre-war population was 400,000.\n\nA Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia.\n\nElsewhere, some residents of the eastern city of Kharkiv have lived in basements for weeks, trying to stay safe from Russian shelling.

          "text": "The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has stated that a total of 15,225,627 travellers passed through Nigeria\u2019s airports in 2021.\n\nThis was an increase of 101.02 per cent in domestic and international travel when compared to 2020.\n\nThe data released by the NBS on Wednesday, stated that the figures were provided by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and verified and validated by the bureau.\n\nThe details showed that the total number of international passengers who passed through Nigerian airports was 2,219,146, as against 1,408,026 passengers in 2020.\n\nThis represented 57.61 per cent growth rate, while in 2021, the total number of domestic passengers who passed through Nigerian airports was 13,006,481 as against 9,069,295 in 2020, which also represented a 43.41 per cent growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, the data showed that the number of arrivals in 2021 stood at 6,533,740, which was higher compared to 4,870,072 in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, departure stood at 6,472,741 in 2021 compared to 4,199,223 in 2020. Similarly, the total number of international passengers who passed through Nigerian airports were 2,219,146 in 2021 as against 1,408,026 passengers in 2020. This represented 57.61 per cent growth rate. Similarly, the number of arrivals in 2021 stood at 1,109,621, which was higher compared to 690,765 in 2020. Also, departure stood at 1,109,525 in 2021 compared to 717,261 in 2020.\n\nThe data showed that Abuja, Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Owerri recorded the highest rate of traffic, while Katsina, Kaduna, Ibadan and Jos recorded the lowest traffic.\n\nA total of 4,758,843 passengers passed through the domestic terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, while 4,093,712 passengers passed through the domestic terminals of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. The domestic terminals of Port Harcourt International Airport had 900,728 passengers, Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (545,749) and Akanu Ibiam International Airport (508,513).\n\nOthers were Owerri (583,464) Benin Airport (433,017) Margaret Ekpo Airport (197,998) Yola (175,699) Maiduguri (197,898), Ilorin (148,109) Akure (113,625), Sokoto (137,511) Kaduna (73,110), Jos (57,020), Ibadan (51,172) and Katsina (30,313).\n\nFor foreign travel, Lagos recorded the highest traffic, with 1,595,522 passengers, while Abuja came second with 565,062 passengers. Port Harcourt had 14,519 passengers, while Kano had 39,441, Enugu had 4,532 and Maiduguri had 68.\n\nReacting to the significant increase in passenger traffic in 2021, the President of National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye said while COVID-19 initially stopped many people from traveling after the lockdown, it was also the major factor that made more people to travel later, as people who were locked down were eager to travel on business and pleasure.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 was a factor that brought down the passenger traffic in 2020 but it is also the reason it went up in 2021. COVID-19 protocol introduced by countries restricted many people from travelling because it was costly and inconveniencing but immediately countries began to lift COVID-19 protocol there was a surge in passenger traffic; people started travelling.\n\n\u201cDoing those tests was not funny, since you would spend almost the same amount you paid for airfare on tests. So that\u2019s why there is increase in air travel,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso the Regional Manager, South West in charge of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba told THISDAY that due to the lockdown in 2020, there was a record of low passenger throughput because people did not travel as much when the airports were reopened in September, 2020 but in 2021 more people travelled with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, adding that there was increase in the number of people on international destinations because \u201ca lot of people are leaving the country.\u201d",
