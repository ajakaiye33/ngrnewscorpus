          "text": ".\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors has urged state governors across the country to emulate Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State in the area of media empowerment.\n\nThe President, NGE, Mustapha Isa, commended the Kogi Governor for his efforts at enhancing the capacity of Journalists and also empowering them to understand their immediate environment with a view to delivering their jobs professionally.\n\nHe said this when the Executive Committee of the Guild paid the Governor a visit at the Kogi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja.\n\nMaking reference to the recently held Annual GYB Workshop for Crime and Political correspondents and editors, where journalists won different categories of awards after series of training and newsroom exercises, he said the development was the first of its kind in the political scene.\n\nOn insecurity in the country, Isa said Bello\u2019s involvement of the people of Kogi in crime-fighting had made Kogi State a reference point in terms of the war against crime and all forms of criminalities.\n\n\u201cInvolving the local people in the fight against crime is the way to go. Kogi State is bordered by about 10 states, but the Governor has been able to tame crime. Things have changed under him. This is the reason response to crime is always quick and effective even where there is an incidence,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NGE president added, \u201cI was at the opening ceremony of the Annual GYB Workshop for Political and Crime Correspondents in Abuja. I saw the layout of the programme, quality of trainers and quality of programmes, and can only thank you on behalf of my colleagues, for that wonderful initiative.\n\n\u201cWe call on other Governors to emulate this and also help enhance capacity in the Nigerian media industry. This would do nothing but help the country achieve its growth objectives better, with informed and standard reportage.\u201d\n\nIsa particularly commended the Governor for blasting some Chinese contractors who were accused of doing a shoddy job on the ongoing construction of the Specialist Hospital in the state.\n\nHe however asked Bello to throw more light on the issue.\n\nBello, while responding, thanked the President of the Guild for appreciating his \u201clittle\u201d contributions and promised to make the empowerment programme a regular event.\n\nOn the issue of security and crime-fighting in Kogi State raised by the Guild president, Bello said it was the business of everyone and not just the government alone.\n\nHe added, \u201cI ensure that every citizen of Kogi State takes part in the fight against crime and criminalities. Every citizen of Kogi State is a potential crime fighter, so the job becomes easier. We assist law enforcement agencies in various ways.\n\n\u201cWhile it was lacking in the past was in the area of collaboration and intelligence sharing. We ensure that all law enforcement agencies do their jobs with utmost responsibility. As a government, we open up our doors to all citizens of the state to make sure citizens participate efficiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not recorded zero crime rate, but that is our target. I repeat that Kogi is still safer than any state in the country today,\u201d the Governor noted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nOsun state Governor, Gboyega Oyetola has hailed Nigerians for their resilience and contributions to national development since independence, saying while Nigeria may not have attained some of its developmental projections at independence in 1960, the country is however not stagnant as it has made some incremental progress.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the current trajectory of governance at the federal level could turn around the fortunes of the country and restore its lost primacy.\n\nGov. Oyetola spoke yesterday in Abuja at a brief interface with journalists on the occasion of his 67th birthday.\n\n\u201cI think by any standard, we have moved. We may not have attained the level that we are thinking of as a nation, I think we are moving. Comparing us with other nations that had attained the same independence as ours may not necessarily be too good enough because you are not too sure of what they have.\n\n\u201cWe could do better given the level that we are now, particulary the efforts that have been put into running the affairs of the country by the present administration of President Muhamadu Buhari. I think we are moving. We are not stagnant.\n\n\u201cWe are challenged. For instance, the issue of security is a big challenge but that is not only peculiar to Nigeria, we have the challenges in other parts of the world. But what is important is for you not to give up. I believe we are making progress, we may not be at the level which we are expecting as a nation but we are not stagnant. Nigeria is moving forward\u201d, he stated.\n\nOn governance in his state and how he has been able to overcome the past challenge of meeting its financial obligations to workers, the governor said with his years of managing human and financial resources in the private sector, he has had no problem paying the salary of workers.\n\n\u201cThere is no magic. It is a question of defining your priorities, getting them right. I also believe that workers deserve their pay. Don\u2019t forget that I came from the private sector background. I employed people in my company. As a matter of policy, there was no time I didn\u2019t pay their monthly salary. So, I decided that moving forward, I must of necessity make the payment of workers salary a priority.\n\n\u201cGod has been quite kind. I look at my cash flow and define my priorities right. So, there is no magic, it is a question of creativity and setting your priorities right. There is no magic in finance. It is nothing extraordinary but my background has actually helped me to able to look at some of these issues and define what I need to do at any point in time\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe governor also thanked God for his benevolence all through the years, saying he feels good at 67.\n\n\u201cFirst of all I want to thank you almighty God for sparing my life over the years till to date and for giving me very good health. I must thank my family too for taking good care of me. I think is the grace of God, we should give the almighty God the glory for been able to attain 67. I am very healthy. I have no problem with my health. So we thank God\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Udeme Akpan\n\nTHE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, Thursday, disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s crude oil reserves dropped to 36,910 million barrels in 2020, from 37,453 million barrels in 2016, indicating a decrease of 1.4 per cent or 543 million barrels in five years.\n\nIn its just-released 2021 Annual Statistical Bulletin, OPEC disclosed that, the nation\u2019s oil reserves hovered at 37,453 million barrels in 2017, before sliding to 36,972 million barrels in 2018 and 36,890 million barrels in 2019.\n\nThe organization further noted the low deployment of rigs for exploration, which stood at 49 in 2020, due mainly to limited investment in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nHowever, it stated that the number of oil wells completed increased slightly to 81 in 2020, from 76 in 2016, adding that 76, 81 and 100 oil wells were completed in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nAlso, OPEC maintained that the average daily oil production in 2020 stood at 1.486 million barrels, while the cumulative production in the same year was 34.42 billion barrels.\n\nIn any case, the situation has not improved significantly in 2021 as the rig count; fell by 49.5 per cent to 53 in the first eight months of 2021, from 105, recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nThe rig count, a major index for measuring the level of activities in the upstream oil sector, was obtained from the reports of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC.\n\nThe reports severally attributed the development to the Coronavirus pandemic and relatively low crude oil prices as major factors.\n\nIt was also partly attributed to the prolonged delay associated with the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, into law.\n\nHowever, the rig count of other African oil and gas producing countries, especially Algeria also dropped to 191 in 2021, from 271 recorded in 2020, while the rig count of Libya and Angola rose to 32 and 114, from 26 and 101 respectively, during the period.\n\nCommenting on the development, the National President, Oil and Gas Service Providers Association of Nigeria, OGSPAN, Mr. Colman Obasi, said: \u201cThe dwindling rig count clearly showed that the nation is not investing enough in the upstream sector. It also illustrated that we might not likely meet set targets, especially the attainment of 40 billion barrels reserves target by 2025.\u201d",

          "title": "Gambo explains reason for Naval base in Kano",
          "text": "The Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, Thursday gave reason, the Nigerian Navy instituted a Naval base in Kano.\n\nGambo during an Open Ears Conference 2 averred that the Naval base in Kano was purely for administrative and operational reasons.\n\nExplaining how it was moved from Owerrinta, somewhere within Aba and Owerri, Gambo said: \u201cLet me use this opportunity to clarify that what the navy established in Kano is a logistic college. The granted logistics college have thrown up lots of reactions but it has also given us the opportunity to shed some light on our establishment across the nation and some of the programs that we have as far as developing capacity and civil authority in Nigeria is concern.\n\n\u201cFor clarity, the Nigerian Navy has a Finance and Logistics college in Owerrinta, somewhere within Aba and Owerri. This College is responsible of training of personnels in the area of logistics and finance.\n\n\u201cBut due to the growth and development imperatives, it was considered that the colleges should be separated and the logistics college is now move to Kano.\n\n\u201c So what is established in Kano is logistics college and the finance college remain in Owerrinta. Before now, Owerrita is not only the land-lock location with a naval establishment. We also had provost and regulatory school in Makodi where we train our personnel in the area of Naval provost duties.\n\n\u201cI will also like to clarify that it is not only these basis that marked our presence in the North, the Nigerian Navy is deeply involved in the anti-insurgency, terrorism and also in the internal security operations across the North.\n\n\u201cIn the North-East we have a joint taskforce, Operation Hadin Kai, the Navy has over 170 personnels that are fighting alongside the Army, and the Air-force to combat the threats that we face. Equally in the North-West where we have a joint task force on Operation Hadarin Daji, the Navy has more than 250 persons that are fighting to counter banditry and other issues of insecurity there.\n\nIn the North-central, we also have about 100 men working alongside our colleagues to combat banditry, kidnapping, and all the issues relating to insecurity. Operation save corridor, they are responsible for the management of surrendered terrorists and bandits are working alongside other government agencies. The Navy also is represented there.\n\n\u201cWe have about 15 personnels working there. We also have our presence in operation save heaven, operation going on in the plateau. Then Southern Kaduna to combat issues relating to herders and farmers clashes. So it is not just Kano that we are present in the North, for about 10 years, we have been in the North-East. And since operations started in the North-West, we have been there. In the North-Central (Plateau) we have been there and all areas where we have security challenges.\n\nLike the Chief of defence Staff explained, beyond defending the territorial integrity of Nigeria, the Armed forces of Nigeria have the responsibility to offer support to the civil authority to maintain law and order and this secondary role, the Armed forces have been doing everything to develop the capacity but of course law and order is in the capacity of the government and we are working closely not just with the government, but with other security agencies and the civil society to deliver the much desired security in the country.\n\n\u201cLet me also add that the logistic college established in Kano, was established alongside two Naval bases that would be performing full maritime operations at the Oguta lake, the Nigerian Navy is establishing a forward operating base because of increasing activities of IPOB and ESN as we as sabotage of our oil and Gas facilities and we are working alongside other agencies in the area to combat these threats. Also in Lagos,the Lekki axis, the Nigeria Navy is also establishing a base.\n\n\u201cLekki is a stretch that hosts a lot of investments critical to the economic well-being of Nigeria. The petrol we consume in Nigeria land in Lagos offshore and it is from there that it is transferred to other parts for consumption across the length and breath of Nigeria. Significantly, the Dangote refinery is coming on string. It\u2019s not just a refinery, it\u2019s coming with a Fertilizer Plant. And there are several development along that corridor worth billions of Dollars that requires protection. So the Navy also is establishing a base to attend to these. Mr. Richard also alluded to the fact that the base is motivated by the need to do something for his State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a coincidence that the chief of Naval State is from Kano State. But nation building is part of the role and responsibility of the Nigerian Navy. Serving in the Navy are Nigerians from the 36 States and the federal capital territory and if there is any thing that we can do to a sense of belonging not just by these men that have volunteered to serve their country but others that are still there and can enhance security, the Nigerian Navy would not shy away from doing that. But of course, the Naval establishment in Kano was established for purely administrative and operational reasons. It is to give vent to proper development of the two colleges.\n\n\u201cOne responsible for finance, which is being retained at Owerrinta, and the other responsible for logistics that base would also offer support to the Naval operation that are already ongoing in the North. The operations in the North-West currently are being supported operations down South from Lokoja, from Abuja and sometimes from Lagos. The operations in the North-West, and other areas would greatly be enhanced.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says killing inhuman, reprehensible\n\n\u2022Obiano places N20m bounty on murderers\n\n\u2022South-east govs demand arrest\n\n\u2022Region under siege, Ohaneze warns\n\n\u2022Senate observes a minute silence, as Obi expresses shock\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Joe Chukindi in Awka, Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, expressed sadness over the gruesome killing of Dr. Chike Akunyili, widower of the late former Director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Professor Dora Akunyili, and assured that his killers would not go scot-free. Buhari described the killing of Akunyili as inhuman and reprehensible, stressing that his killers would face the wrath of God and man.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was reinforced by the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who placed a N20 million bounty on the heads of Akunyili\u2019s killers.\n\nThe South-east Governors Forum also condemned the killing and demanded security agencies move quickly to arrest the perpetrators of the dastardly act and bring them to justice. In a statement by the Chairman of the Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, the forum described the killing as \u201cnot only barbaric but also unbecoming how much human lives no longer matter in our society. We give security agencies a marching order to go all out to uncover and arrest all the perpetrators of this inhuman act and make them face justice,\u201d\n\nIn its own reaction, the apex Igbo sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, raised the alarm over the incessant killing of innocent citizens in Igboland, concluding that the zone is currently under a heavy siege.\n\nThe Senate observed a minute silence for the deceased at its plenary yesterday, and a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, expressed shock at the murder of Akunyili.\n\nBuhari, in a release on Wednesday by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, shared the pain of the children, relatives, and friends of the deceased.\n\nThe president said he had fond memories of working with the late Dora Akunyili at the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) and Nigerians would never forget the memory of the amazon, who distinguished herself as a courageous, dependable and patriotic citizen.\n\nEnjoining security agencies and leaders of thought to work harder to bring an end to the violence being unleashed on innocent Nigerians, the president assured the grieving families, who lost their loved ones in the incident, that the perpetrators of the heinous act \u201cwill face both the judgement of man, and that of God.\u201d\n\nObiano placed a N20 million bounty on the heads of the killers and others, in a press release he personally signed after a meeting with heads of security agencies in the state. He implored anyone with useful information about the killing of Akunyili and other persons, who fell to the bullets of gunmen between Sunday and Tuesday, to come forward with it.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is on a very sad note that I address the state today to condemn in very strong terms, the violence that has been witnessed in Anambra in the past few days.\n\n\u201cSince last weekend, some armed persons have unleashed terror with sporadic attacks on innocent citizens in various parts of the state. From the briefings I have received from security commanders, offices of some political parties, branded campaign vehicles and individuals occupying them have been attacked with killings and burning of vehicles observed.\n\n\u201cOther innocent road users have become victims of this menace with many losing their lives and others, their properties. Between Sunday 26th and yesterday, 28th September 2021, attacks on citizens at Oko, Agulu, Obosi, Nkpor, Nnobi, Nnewi, and other places have left about 10 people dead, including an illustrious son of this state, Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Professor Dora Akunyili, who was, reportedly, gunned down yesterday around Nkpor.\n\n\u201cTo reinforce our commitment and seriousness on this issue, I, on behalf of the state government, wish to announce a twenty million naira (N20, 000,000.00) reward for any useful information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of these heinous attacks on our state.\u201d\n\nThe governor regretted the wanton killing of illustrious sons and daughters of Anambra people.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese are our own people dying every day and for what reason? Ndi Anambra, these attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now. I have, therefore, conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all security agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land.\n\n\u201cI charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same. Everything that needs to be done will be done and no stone will be left unturned in this effort. My directive to this effect is clear and I urge every security personnel on duty in Anambra State to do his utmost best to secure our people.\u201d\n\nOhaneze Ndigbo Alleges South-east Under Siege\n\nIgbo\u2019s apex sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze NdIgbo Worldwide, raised the alarm over the incessant killing of innocent citizens of the Igbo nation. Ohanaeze said the zone was currently under a heavy siege.\n\nPresident General of the organisation, Professor George Obiozor, raised the alarm during the Igbo Day Prayer Summit organised by Ohanaeze NdIgbo Worldwide, in collaboration with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East zone. Obiozor spoke against the backdrop of Dr. Chike Akunyili\u2019s murder.\n\nThe president-general, who was represented by Secretary General of Ohanaeze, Mr. Innocent Nwudenyi, stated that there was need for the people of the South-east to pause and seek the face of God, because there were too many killings in the zone lately.\n\nObiozor stated, \u201cAs we gather today to pray, we need to take a pause in Igbo Nation. We need to seek the face of God, we need to remember our brothers and sisters that have been killed over the years but more importantly, we need to think about today. The Igbo Nation is under siege; there are too many killings. Many unnecessary killings in the zone.\u201d\n\nHe described the killing of Akunyili as unfortunate, regrettable and most worrisome, pointing out that the killings in Anambra State and otherstates of the South-east have reached an alarming stage.\n\nThe Ohaneze Ndigbo president noted that something needed to be done urgently to save the South-east from the unnecessary killings. He also asked the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other groups to think deeply and take a pause.\n\n\u201cProfessor Obiozor has asked IPOB and other groups to think deeply, because if they kill every person, who will be there,\u201d Nwudenyi said. \u201cWe need to take a pause as a people and understand what is confronting us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president-general regretted that beyond the sit-at-home order, there were on-going killings from one state to another in the South-east and called on the clergy to pray fervently for the zone.\n\nIn an address, Ebonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, wondered why Igbos would be killing each other, and called for brotherly love, harmony, and peace among the Igbo.\n\nUmahi, who was represented by Secretary to the State Government and Coordinating Commissioner, Dr. Kenneth Ugballa, regretted the killing of Akunyili and noted that his death was a big blow to NdIgbo\n\nSenate Observes a Minute Silence\n\nThe Senate, Wednesday, observed a minute silence for the late Dr. Chike Akunyili, who was brutally murdered by unknown gunmen at Afor Nkpor in Anambra State on Tuesday. The moment of silence in the Red Chamber followed a point of order raised by Senator Uche Ekwunife (Anambra Central).\n\nComing under Order 43 of the Senate Standing Rules \u2013 Personal Explanation, Ekwunife noted with concern that on Tuesday, September 28, 2021, Akunyili was gunned down in a most gruesome manner at Afor Nkpor, Anambra State.\n\nAccording to Ekwunife, Chike Akunyili was till his death Medical Director of St. Leo Hospital in Enugu. She said the deceased was an established academic, medical director and one who had contributed to the development of healthcare in Nigeria.\n\nNarrating the circumstance that led to his death, Ekwunife said, \u201cDr. Akunyili went to Onitsha to present a paper and receive an award at the memorial lecture put together by a civil society organisation in honour of his late wife, Professor Dora Akunyili, and was gruesomely attacked at Nkpor on his way home.\u201d\n\nThe ranking senator also noted that lots of horrible attacks and killings had been going on across the entire South-east zone especially, Anambra, Enugu and Imo states. She urged the Inspector General of Police and heads of other law enforcement agencies to step up action towards unravelling perpetrators of the killings in Anambra State and other South-east states.\n\nEkwunife also urged governors in the South-east to rise to their responsibilities of ensuring safety of life and property of the citizens as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nObi Expresses Shock, Identifies Body in Morgue\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, expressed shock at the death of Dr Chike Akunyili, who was shot dead on Tuesday evening. Obi, who spoke to journalists, said he was in Lagos on Tuesday for some functions, and on Wednesday morning he got the news of the death of Akunyili on social media and immediately boarded a flight back to confirm it.\n\nThe former governor said, \u201cI was lucky to get the first flight, and I landed in Owerri and moved straight to Iyienu Hospital in Onitsha, where I and his son identified him in the mortuary.\n\n\u201cHe was not the only victim, there was his driver and police security aide. About nine people in all were involved in the shooting on Tuesday, and some of them were even headless, and it is now a problem identifying them.\u201d\n\nObi said the killing of Akunyili, who was a private medical practitioner, remained a great pain to him and members of Agulu community, where Obi and the late Akunyili hailed from.\n\nObi added, \u201cIt is a very sad thing to think of. If you knew Dr Akunyili, you will know that he could not hurt anyone, not here in his village and not anywhere else. He was a good man who was so happy with himself.\n\n\u201cAs for who his killers are, I can only say that no one knows. It is a very sad thing, and as I speak to you, Agulu people are in mourning.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tony Olofu, assured the people of the command\u2019s commitment to public safety.\n\nIn a press statement by the command\u2019s spokesperson, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Toochukwu Ikenga, Olofu, who had visited the scene of the incident for on-the-spot-assessment, called for collaboration between the people and the police to fish out bad elements in the state.\n\nIkenga, in the release, said, \u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Anambra State Command, CP Tony Olofu, has today, 29th September, 2021, observed with grave concern, the series of security breaches that have taken place within the state, and has, therefore, ordered tactical commanders of the command to immediately put an end to the madness.\n\n\u201cHe gave this order when he led senior police officers from the command on on-the-spot assessment to the crime scenes. The CP, while regretting the unfortunate loss of lives and valuables due to those senseless acts, has sued for calm, as the command collaborates with other security agencies in the state to decisively deal with the perpetrators, who seem to have lost every iota of human conscience and sensibility in them.\n\n\u201cHe implores members of the public, particularly, residents of the state, to continue to partner the police with a view to containing these atrocious acts, stressing that the command is more than ever determined to flush out these undesirable elements and make the entire state safer for law-abiding citizens to go about their lawful businesses.\u201d\n\nAnambra has within three days witnessed several incidents of attack by unidentified gun wielding men.\n\nPersons riding in two unmarked Sienna vehicles and a Toyota Hummer bus attacked a team of police operatives attached to the Aguata Area Command about 2pm on Tuesday, while the team was on routine patrol duty along Ezinifite/Igboukwu road. The hoodlums set the patrol vehicle ablaze and fled the scene.\n\nThere was also a gun attack on a member of the public about 5pm on the same day along Oko road. The attackers set the vehicle of the victim ablaze, leaving him with a bullet wound on his feet before escaping. About 4pm on the same day, some gunmen, in an attempt to snatch a Lexus 350 from its driver along Agulu Road, shot the owner and abandoned the victim and the car, and fled.\n\nThe incident at Nkpor, which claimed the life of Akunyili, also led to the death of about nine other persons.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants govt to wage total war on them, bomb hideouts\n\n\u2022Says their leaders should be declared wanted\n\n\u2022Gunmen kill over 43 villagers in Niger\n\n\u2022IG directs AIGs, CPs to lead security operations at independence anniversary\n\n\u2022Wike identifies lopsided appointments, injustice as cause of insecurity\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh, Juliet Akoje in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nWorried by the criminal activities of bandits in many parts of the country, the Senate, yesterday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a total war on the felons and declare them as terrorists. The Red Chamber resolved these at its Wednesday plenary. It called on Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, order the military to eliminate the bandits by bombing their hideouts.\n\nThe Senate also told the president to immediately declare all known leaders of the bandits wanted, and track them wherever they are for arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe resolutions followed the consideration of a motion on banditry in Sokoto State, sponsored by Senator Ibrahim Gobir.\n\nNonetheless, bandits, late on Tuesday, raided parts of Niger State, allegedly killing no fewer than 43 villagers. Details of how the incident happened were still sketchy at the time of filing this report due to the jamming of communication networks in the areas.\n\nBut the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, directed Assistant Inspectors-General (AIGs) in the Zonal Police Headquarters and Commissioners of Police in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to personally lead security operations across the country in order to maintain law and order during this year\u2019s independence anniversary celebration.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike identified politics of exclusion and absence of social justice as some of the causes of insecurity in the country.\n\nPresenting the motion on the floor of the Senate, Gobir lamented that Sokoto East Senatorial District had become a safe haven for bandits following a crackdown on them by the military in Zamfara State. He expressed worry that on Saturday, September 25, about 21 security men were killed in Dama and Gangara villages by rampaging bandits.\n\nAccording to the senator, out of those killed, 15 were soldiers, three mobile policemen, and three members of Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, in addition to yet to be ascertained number of civilians from the neighbouring villages.\n\nGobir stated, \u201cThis has gone to portray the seriousness of the problem, which requires concerted and urgent action by the declaration of total war on banditry.\n\n\u201cLosing such numbers of trained security personnel will further deplete the numerical strength of the security personnel we have in the country, therefore, jeopardising the security architecture of the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, most of the bandits have now relocated to Sabon Bimini and Isa local government areas due to the sustained military operations in the Zamfara axis.\n\nThe ranking senator observed that while the crackdown on the bandits was taking place in Zamfara State, no concrete measures were taken in Sokoto State to prevent a spillover from Zamfara, a situation that left the state exposed to the activities of bandits. He said the present military onslaught on the bandits was not well coordinated, stressing that it is only being orchestrated in Zamfara State, instead of all the frontline states ravaged by bandits.\n\nGobir called on the military to carry out a holistic operation on frontline states, such as Sokoto, Katsina, Niger, and Kaduna, in order to produce effective and desired results.\n\nSpeaking after the adoption of the motion, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, commended the efforts of the armed forces in the fight against insecurity in the country. While calling for increased funding for the military, Lawan charged relevant committees of the National Assembly to ensure that funds appropriated for the armed forces were judiciously applied to the purposes they were budgeted.\n\nThe senate president said, \u201cI think the issue of insecurity is one issue we will never get tired of debating here, and we must commend our armed forces and other security agencies. They give their lives in trying to secure this country, and that is the ultimate sacrifice anybody could pay. I believe that they are doing their best, but we also need to do our best as a government by giving them the kind of resources that they need.\n\n\u201cI believe we have done that in the supplementary budget, like I pointed out, but we also need to improve the annual appropriation for them. If we could pass over N800 billion in the supplementary budget, I don\u2019t see why we cannot improve the resources up to N1 trillion and then hold our security agencies accountable.\n\n\u201cI believe that we need to monitor the procurement processes when we give such kind of resources to our armed forces. The security related committees, particularly, the armed forces related committees \u2013 Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force committees \u2013 need to work very closely on the procurement processes by these services. We must ensure that funds appropriated are not put in the wrong areas, and ensure that this fight is taken to its logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe senate, accordingly, as part of its resolutions, directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other relevant federal government agencies to, as a matter of urgency, give all the necessary support to the victims of bandits in Sokoto and other parts of the country. It also observed a minute silence in honor of the fallen heroes and civilians, who lost their lives in the unwholesome activities of the bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Niger raid last night, reports had it that the bandits were escaping from the military operations in parts of Zamfara and Kaduna states when they carried out the killings. They were also said to have set some houses ablaze and kidnapped an unknown number of persons.\n\nSecretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, confirmed the story but did not give details.\n\nIn a related development in Sokoto State, three mobile policemen were reportedly killed on Tuesday, when bandits stormed Kagara town, the headquarters of Rafi Local Government Area. The marauders also kidnapped a large number of people from the Kagara market, where they first operated before ransacking the Emir\u2019s palace in the town.\n\nA source from the area told THISDAY last night that the monarch, who escaped kidnap, in company with the Commissioner for Police, was in Kagara town to assure the people that government was on top of the situation.\n\nThe SSG confirmed the death of three people in the Kagara incident\n\nBut the Inspector General of Police assured of maximum security during the independence anniversary celebrations.\n\nA police statement said the force had put in place adequate security measures to protect the citizens, ensure the success of the activities lined-up for the anniversary celebrations, and prevent any untoward situation throughout the period of the celebration and beyond.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cConsequently, the Assistant Inspectors General of Police and Commissioners of Police in all the zonal and state commands and the FCT have been directed to lead the independence anniversary security operations from the frontline.\n\n\u201cThey are to ensure high visibility and confidence boosting patrols around the venues of the celebrations, residential areas and other places of public resort to prevent any infiltration by hostile elements.\u201d\n\nThe IG pledged the unalloyed loyalty of the Nigeria Police to the sovereignty of the country as well as its unflinching commitment to combating criminality in the country and ensuring the safety of the citizenry. He called on citizenry to go about the celebrations in the most peaceful and law abiding manner, even as he appealed \u201cfor a new sense of pan-Nigerian spirit, patriotism, love and deliberate efforts by leaders at all levels at de-escalating ethnic tensions and suspicions in the land\u201d.\n\nThe IG also enjoined the citizenry to continue to cooperate with the police and other security agencies in fighting crimes and criminality in the country.\n\nWike, who blamed politics of exclusion as well as the absence of social justice for insecurity in the country, also accused the federal government of failing to provide \u201cresponsible governance\u201d that could promote sustainable governance. The governor spoke in Abuja at a lecture delivered at the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS), titled, \u201cGovernance, Security and Sustainable Development in Africa, Nexus, Challenges and Prospects: Rivers State as a Metaphor.\u201d He took a swipe at those opposed to power shift, saying they are promoting injustice.\n\nThe lecture was delivered to the participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course (EIMC 14), who were rounding-off their study at the NISS, preparatory to the award of the fellow of the security institute.\n\nWike stated, \u201cWhat we have today cannot be said to be a responsive government that will provide all these. What we are hearing is excuse one, excuse two. It is terrible. So, if you don\u2019t have a responsive governance, you will not have environmental sustainability, because it requires good governance.\n\n\u201cA sense of social justice, equity is fundamental to achieving peace, security and sustainable development, which only good governance can achieve. You cannot have this if you do not have good governance and you cannot talk about sustainable development when you don\u2019t have good governance. It is practically impossible.\n\n\u201cThus, among other structural and infrastructural variables, nothing can be more relevant to the progress of society than the practice of good governance, led by visionary, effective and transformational leadership as essential precondition for effective democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, and enhancing the living conditions of ordinary people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, poor governance and bad leadership model continue to characterise Africa\u2019s political, economic, security and social landscapes.\u201d\n\nHe said those who held that zoning was unconstitutional were promoting inequity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI am sorry, people forget, when people say zoning is unconstitutional, but you know what is called equity. Equity brings peace. Let everybody be part of it. But the moment you begin to think that this is your own exclusivity, that nobody else, then it becomes a crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you begin to see some people, to deny them certain things, that will lead to insecurity and with insecurity, you cannot achieve sustainable development. Take, for example, when the Igbo are crying to say, look, in appointment, you don\u2019t recognise us, what is wrong in listening to them?\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong in sitting back and saying, look, we are all one, we want this country to be together in order for us to achieve sustainable development? Because, if you don\u2019t include them, some of them will begin to believe that they are not part of the system.\u201d\n\nWike recalled Buhari\u2019s position on sections of the country that did not vote for him, saying, \u201cNow, take for example, with all due respect, when Mr. President said ninety-something per cent of whatever will go to only those who voted for him, that alone will create crisis.\n\n\u201cThat is not part of good governance.

          "text": "\u2022Says they\u2019re only against language used by southern colleagues\n\n\u2022SaMBA claims north\u2019s position can inflame succession agitation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Emameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday, clarified the position of the northern governors over the power shift controversy, saying his colleagues in the north never opposed the presidency going to the south in 2023, but were only against the language used by their southern colleagues.\n\nThis is as the Southern and Middle-Belt Alliance (SaMBA), has described as inflammatory, the resolution of the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) over power rotation, saying such statement was capable of fuelling secessionist agitations in the country.\n\nThe Northern Governors Forum, in a communiqu\u00e9 read by their chairman and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, after their emergency meeting, had said: \u201cThe Forum observed that some northern states governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political Zone in the south to promote unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemn the statement by the Southern Governor\u2019s Forum that the presidency must go to the south. The statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected president shall:-score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation. In the case of run-up, simple majority wins the election.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the back and forth between governors of the two regions had elicited concerns as well as reactions from other stakeholders from both ends, suggesting obnoxious scenarios in the two regions.\n\nBut El-Rufai, on Wednesday, clarified the resolution of the governors and said they were alarmed that their southern counterparts could use the word \u201cmust\u201d in their agitation for power shift to the south after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure in 2023.\n\nThe North West governor stated that the word \u201cmust\u201d was at variance with democracy, which was characterised by negotiations and horse-trading by parties involved, often out of the public glare.\n\nAccording to him, he and some other northern governors had earlier called for a power shift in 2023 in their individual capacities to foster national unity and togetherness, adding that \u201che was called names by his people for making that call.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai, who made the clarifications in a media chat with select Kaduna-based broadcast journalists on Tuesday night, pointed out that the media misrepresented the resolution of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum meeting which held on Monday, on power shift.\n\nAlthough he spoke in Hausa, the Kaduna governor reminded the south that, \u201cThe north has supported southern presidential aspirants in the past\u201d, adding that they \u201csupported Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s aspiration in 1999 and his re-election in 2003.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai was of the view that their southern colleagues should have reached out to them on the issue of power shift instead of playing to the gallery.\n\nReacting too to the development, SaMBA in a statement by its spokesman, Rwang Pam Jnr., emphasised that though there was no express provision for zoning in the Constitution, Section 14(3) explicitly provides for distribution of offices in the composition of government in the country and therefore disapproves of any attempt by any region to dominate other regions.\n\nSaMBA, therefore, warned the Northern Governors Forum that any further attempt to want to retain power in 2023 would defeat the purpose of a united Nigeria, where every man and region\u2019s right to rule was equal and would endanger the already fragile unity of the country.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cThe recent statement credited to the Northern Governors Forum that power shift is unconstitutional, is an attempt to stand history on its head and could fuel separatist agitations in the country.\n\n\u201cThe section of the Constitution referenced by the Northern Governors only refers to the requirements for someone to be declared as elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but the relevant constitutional provision for power rotation is section 14(3), which explicitly provides for the spread of political offices in the country to prevent one ethnic group or region from dominating the others for the sake of peace and unity in the country.\n\n\u201cSection 14(3) states: The composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or in any of its agencies.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and a danger to the unity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the core North to spend eight years in office and still be thinking of seeking another eight years.\n\n\u201cNigerians are aware, that after former President Olusegun Obasanjo completed his 8-year term in 2007, the south unanimously agreed for the Northern Nigeria to produce the President. In 2007, the South did not cry that zoning is unconstitutional, and President Obasanjo duly handed over Power to a northerner, the late former President Umaru Ya\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cIt is also public knowledge that former President Goodluck Jonathan lost the 2015 Presidential election to President Muhammadu Buhari partly, because of the global sentiment, that it was the turn of the North to produce the President, even though Dr Goodluck Jonathan had only spent one term in office as elected president.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is not in the interest of the country for the North to hold onto power in 2023,because doing so will be to the detriment of the already fragile unity of the country and more likely to lead to an increase of separatist movements across the country. The position of the Middle Belt Region is categorically clear; that it agrees with the rest of Nigerians, that the South should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, unequivocally advise the Northern Governors Forum to perish the thought of holding onto power in 2023 and the same applies to the various political parties (APC, PDP, or any other party) to bury the thought of zoning the Presidency to the North.\n\n\u201cWe further advise the governors of the 15 states, where the middle belt ethnic nationalities constitute the dominant population, that any governor from the Middle Belt that supported the notion that power should remain with the Northern region is not reflecting the views of their peoples,\u201d the group insisted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "As senate moves to stop illegal charges on cargo transport\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has written formally to the Senate requesting to replace the nomination of Engr. Sarki Auwalu as the Chief Executive Officer on the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) board.\n\nThis is just as the Red Chamber moved on Wednesday to stop illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe President\u2019s request was contained in a letter dated September 28, 2021, and read at Wednesday plenary by the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan.\n\nThe President had in an earlier letter dated September 16, 2021, requested the upper chamber to confirm Auwalu alongside three others as board members of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nIn his new request, President Buhari is, however, asking for the approval of the Senate to replace\n\nSarki Auwalu with Engr. Farouk A. Ahmed as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHe explained that the replacement request was duly in accordance with the provision of Section 34(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Red Chamber commenced moves to stop processing delay and illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe decision to end multiple charges on cargo processing and transport was reached by the upper chamber in a resolution, following consideration of a motion during plenary.\n\nThe motion tilted: \u201cThe need to streamline Import and Export Cargo Processing in the Aviation Sector\u201d was sponsored by Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah.\n\nRising under Order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, Na\u2019Allah noted with dismay the loss of about N250 billion on agro-export of produce in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the loss which translates to a ratio of 87:13 continues to impact negatively on the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNa\u2019Allah noted that there are about 16 sundry charges for goods coming in or out of the country \u2013 with 16 in Lagos and 15 in Abuja \u2013 and many of them being unofficial and illegal.\n\nHe lamented that loading 100 tons of cargo on aircraft cost around $35,000 in Nigeria, compared to Ghana that cost just about $4000 USD.\n\nThe ranking Senator said: \u201cThis has caused substantial damage to the Federal Government efforts of stimulating Capital Inflow\u201d, adding that, \u201cairlines involved in cargo transport have started avoiding Nigeria in view of the prohibitive charges.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, mandated the Joint Committees on Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Aviation and Customs to invite stakeholders and Freight Agents to come with acceptable template of processing Nigeria\u2019s Imports and Exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for the confirmation of Engr. Mohammed Sani Baba, representing Bauchi State as Federal Commissioner in the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, to the Committee on National Planning and Economic Affairs.\n\nThe Committee is expected to screen the nominee and report back to the upper chamber in two weeks.\n\nAlso, the President\u2019s request for the confirmation of five nominees as Commissioners in the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission was referred to the Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes.\n\nThe nominees for screening include: Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, Ekiti (South-West); Mrs. Anne Otelafu Odey, Cross River (South-South); Alh. Goni Ali Gujba, Yobe (North-East); Dr. Louis Solomon Mandama, Adamawa (North-East); and Senator Anthony O. Agbo (Ebonyi).\n\nThe Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes Committee also has two weeks to screen the nominees and report back to the Senate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Bows To Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami, Re-approves Payment Of $418million Suspicious Paris Club Debts",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has re-approved the payment of a controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors after being manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nMultiple presidential sources told SaharaReporters that the Debt Management Office (DMO) has issued promissory notes to the creditors, the means of payment approved by Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe development is against the Nigerian Governors Forum\u2019s protest and calls for a forensic audit into the suspicious claims of the creditors.\n\nThe governors had recently queried the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, for issuing promissory notes in favour of the creditors.\n\nThe governors claimed that President Buhari approved the payment of the $418million Paris Club judgment debt despite pending court cases.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE Buhari\u2019s Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Fume At Finance Minister, Plot Sack For Stopping $418million Paris Club Payment To Consultants\n\nBuhari, however, in early September directed the Finance Ministry to ask the DMO which was supposed to pay in form of promissory notes, to stay action \u201cuntil all the cases are exhausted\u201d.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that the promissory notes were issued to the creditors on Thursday in-spite of the fraudulent claims by the creditors.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the clear evidence of fraud being perpetrated against the Nigerian nation, President Buhari has released a $418million promissory note for jobs not done. This is a government of integrity indeed. God help Nigeria,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Gambari, and the Attorney-General who were both promised 40 percent of the money by these creditors. Everything was done during the UN General Assembly in New York, it\u2019s so sad that we have a president who can be easily manipulated.\n\n\u201cEven the Director-General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, was reluctant to issue the promissory notes to them. She was sad about the development.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\nSee Also Corruption REVEALED: How Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Tricked Buhari To Fraudulently Pay N90.6billion To Controversial Paris Club Lawyer\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is one Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018 by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned at Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact took a swipe at it.\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that \u201clet me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date of I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted.\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011 long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above.\n\n\u201cTracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami and Gambari persuaded Buhari to approve $159million as legal fees to Edward.\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and Gambari also established that TED EDWARD did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edward be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and The Nigerian Governor Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\u201cAll needed to be done is to allow an independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, took statements and established that none of the contacts were executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has re-approved the payment of a controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors after being manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nMultiple presidential sources told SaharaReporters that the Debt Management Office (DMO) has issued promissory notes to the creditors, the means of payment approved by Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe development is against the Nigerian Governors Forum\u2019s protest and calls for a forensic audit into the suspicious claims of the creditors.\n\nThe governors had recently queried the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, for issuing promissory notes in favour of the creditors.\n\nThe governors claimed that President Buhari approved the payment of the $418million Paris Club judgment debt despite pending court cases.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE Buhari\u2019s Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Fume At Finance Minister, Plot Sack For Stopping $418million Paris Club Payment To Consultants\n\nBuhari, however, in early September directed the Finance Ministry to ask the DMO which was supposed to pay in form of promissory notes, to stay action \u201cuntil all the cases are exhausted\u201d.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that the promissory notes were issued to the creditors on Thursday in-spite of the fraudulent claims by the creditors.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the clear evidence of fraud being perpetrated against the Nigerian nation, President Buhari has released a $418million promissory note for jobs not done. This is a government of integrity indeed. God help Nigeria,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Gambari, and the Attorney-General who were both promised 40 percent of the money by these creditors. Everything was done during the UN General Assembly in New York, it\u2019s so sad that we have a president who can be easily manipulated.\n\n\u201cEven the Director-General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, was reluctant to issue the promissory notes to them. She was sad about the development.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\nSee Also Corruption REVEALED: How Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Tricked Buhari To Fraudulently Pay N90.6billion To Controversial Paris Club Lawyer\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is one Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018 by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned at Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact took a swipe at it.\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that \u201clet me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date of I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted.\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011 long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above.\n\n\u201cTracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami and Gambari persuaded Buhari to approve $159million as legal fees to Edward.\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and Gambari also established that TED EDWARD did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edward be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and The Nigerian Governor Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\u201cAll needed to be done is to allow an independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, took statements and established that none of the contacts were executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governor Forum that all the jobs executed by Edward and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\nOther beneficiaries include a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about N54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

          "text": "A French court Thursday imposed a one-year sentence on former president Nicolas Sarkozy after finding him guilty of illegal campaign financing for massive overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign. The verdict came six months after he was found guilty of corruption in a separate trial.\n\nThe court will allow the ex-president to serve the sentence at home by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, FRANCE24 reports.\n\nFormer French President, Sarkozy\n\nSarkozy, who spent nearly twice the legal limit on his failed bid for a second term in office, wasn't present at the Paris court for the announcement of the verdict.\n\nMoments after the sentence was announced, Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog said he would appeal.\n\nThe 66-year-old right-winger pulled out all the stops in 2012 to try fend off the ultimately victorious Socialist candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nA series of lavish US-style election rallies caused his costs to spiral, with the final bill coming to at least 42.8 million euros $49.7 million), nearly double the legal limit of 22.5 million euros.\n\nThe case is known as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the public relations firm that set up a system of fake invoices to mask the real cost of the events.\n\nProsecutors had sought a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the former president. The verdict is not the same as a suspended sentence, as it goes down in his record as a full prison term.\n\nIt was the second guilty verdict this year for Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives despite falling from grace over his legal woes.\n\nThe court stated that Sarkozy \u201cknew\u201d weeks before the 2012 election that the legal limit was at stake and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d failed to supervise additional expenses, with prosecutors accusing him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning about the money issue.\n\nProsecutors argued Sarkozy is \u201cthe only person responsible for his campaign financing\u201d and that he chose to exceed the limit by organising many rallies, including giant ones.\n\nDuring his hearing in June, Sarkozy told the court the extra money didn't go into his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer.\n\nHe denied any \u201cfraudulent intent.\u201d He also insisted he didn't handle the logistics of his campaign for a second term as a president nor did he oversee how money was spent, because he had a team to do that.\n\n\"Can you imagine me going into a meeting to discuss the cost of flags?\" he told the court in June. \"I had too much to do.\" \"From the moment I was told things were in order, I had no reason to give it more thought,\" he added.\n\nThis conviction comes six months after he was given a jail term for corruption and influence peddling in a separate trial, when he tried to a judge in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry.

Like with Thursday\u2019s sentence, he will probably avoid jail, with the judge saying she would consider letting him serve the remaining year of his sentence at home, if he wore an electronic ankle bracelet. His appeal is also pending.\n\nHe became nevertheless France's first post-war president to be handed a custodial sentence.

          "text": "Human rights and pro-democracy group, TakeItBack Movement, has urged security operatives to respect the fundamental human rights of the Nigerian people that will protest against the evils of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led regime on October 1.\n\nThe group also warned that the nation\u2019s security agents should not attack peaceful protesters, as they flood the streets on October 1 Independence Day, adding that the 1999 Nigerian Constitution has protected them.\n\nRecall that some groups in the country have vowed to stage demonstrations to register their displeasure against insecurity, poor economy, lawlessness, and other deficiencies that have characterised the Buhari-led administration.\n\nThe TakeItBack Movement said it will resist any form of brutality, attack or arrest that the Nigerian Police and other security operatives may be scheming against protesting citizens.\n\nThis was in a release issued by the Legal Adviser, TakeItBack Movement, Festus Ogun, which was made available to SaharaReporters on Thursday, and titled, \u2018October 1st Nationwide Protest Is A Fundamental Right: Security Agencies Must Be Well Guided.\u2019\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cAs Nigeria clocks 61, patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians will storm the streets of major cities in protest against bad governance, acute insecurity, poverty, hunger, unemployment, gross disrespect for human rights and dignity and the crude wickedness of the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cTypical of the Nigerian authorities, chances are high that a clampdown will greet tomorrow\u2019s historical protest. It is in view of this that we, at the TakeItBack Movement, remind all security agencies that tomorrow\u2019s October 1st Protest remains a fundamental right enshrined under our extant laws in this country and no form of attack will be tolerated.\n\n\u201cBy the combined effect of Sections 39, 40 and 41 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as altered, the right to protest is safeguarded and guaranteed as a human right that shall be enjoyed by all citizens without arbitrary restraint. Articles 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right equally protect the right to protest. Additionally, Articles 18-21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 fully protect the constitutional liberty to protest.\n\n\u201cEmphasising the sacred nature of the right to protest in a constitutional democracy, the Court of Appeal in the case of IGP V. ANPP (2008) 12 WRN 65 held that \u201ccertainly in a democracy, it is the right of citizens to conduct peaceful processions, rallies or demonstrations without seeking and obtaining permission from anybody. It is a right guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and any law that attempt to curtail such right is null and void and of no effect whatsoever\u201d.\n\n\u201cKnowing fully well that Nigeria is still in the bondage of the political elites and neo-colonialism, we are compelled to remind the authorities of the need to observe all civil rules during our demonstrations tomorrow. While they can grace the historical protest, it is important to remind them that they have a duty to protect us and not arrest or assault us.\n\n\u201cWe shall not condone any form of harassment, intimidation, brutalization or arrest. We shall resist any attempt to encroach on our constitutionally guaranteed rights. The police and other security agencies are hereby put on notice and they should be guided accordingly.\n\n\u201cNothing, no one can stop an idea whose time has come. Aluta continua.\"",
          "summary": "Human rights and pro-democracy group, TakeItBack Movement, has urged security operatives to respect the fundamental human rights of the Nigerian people that will protest against the evils of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led regime on October 1.\nThe TakeItBack Movement said it will resist any form of brutality, attack or arrest that the Nigerian Police and other security operatives may be scheming against protesting citizens.\nArticles 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right equally protect the right to protest.\nAdditionally, Articles 18-21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 fully protect the constitutional liberty to protest.\nThe police and other security agencies are hereby put on notice and they should be guided accordingly.",

          "text": "Ezeiruaku Ifenyinwa Fidelia, a serving member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), says she was allegedly assaulted by Chika Anele, a Nigerian soldier, over an argument on small chops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFidelia has been in the public eye in the past week after a video of the female soldier pouring what appeared to be dirty water on her surfaced online and went viral.\n\nThe corps member, who was serving at the 13 brigade headquarters in Calabar, could be seen in the viral video on her knees while dressed in her full NYSC uniform.\n\nThe incident had provoked a wave of backlashes on social media platforms, with many Nigerian users demanding justice for Fidelia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid the widespread criticism, the army had in a statement assured that the soldier will be sanctioned in line with the extant provisions of the Armed Forces Act.\n\nBut speaking in a recent chat, Fidelia said the incident began after she was called to work as an usher during one event organised by the 13 Brigade headquarters in Calabar.\n\nShe said a senior officer, who happens to be a man, had demanded another plate of the small chops after he mistakenly poured what was given to him on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe corps member added that when she returned to ask for another plate from Anele, who was in charge of the small chops, the soldier allegedly hurled abusive words at her.\n\nShe also claimed that after the event, the officer continued raining abusive words at her while describing her as \u201ca low-life\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis thing started the day we went to Eburutu for a drilling competition organised by the Commander of the Brigade,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was among those ushering people in. So when we got there in the morning, I saw one of my captain friends. He used to be my friend because we play \u2018Ayo\u2019 game together and I always beat him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when I saw him, I tapped him and said \u2018ah, you are even here before the ushers.\u2019 So we laughed.\n\n\u201cOnly for Lt. Anele to shout at me that I shouldn\u2019t touch an officer in uniform. So after scolding me, I went back to my position and I was standing there.\n\n\u201cAnother officer came and he was offering me a handshake. I told him that they said we should not shake an officer in uniform.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, they started sharing small chops. That Anele lady was in charge of the small chops. So, I shared it with the invited guests and some officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne Major called my attention and said that he mistakenly poured his chops on the floor and that I should change it for him.\n\n\u201cI told him that the chops are finished and that the ones he\u2019s seeing are for the umpires. But he insisted.\n\n\u201cNot knowing what to do, I went back to the Anele lady to explain to her that this major is insisting that I change the small chops for him.\n\n\u201cSo, she started insulting me that I\u2019m senseless. That was I not there when she told me that the reserved one is for the umpires? Before then, she had given me a plate of chops, that whenever we are hungry, we should eat. She now ordered me to go and change that one and bring it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe said I don\u2019t have sense. I quickly went and changed it for him. So after the event, she called me and started insulting me all over again.\n\n\u201cAngrily, I went to the other side of the barracks where I met an officer. The officer saw that I was looking forlorn. So he asked me what was happening.\n\n\u201cSo I explained to him that the way some officers are talking to the corpers here, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nThe corps member said the trouble took another dimension on July 28 after the female soldier summoned the corps members over the \u201csmall chops\u201d incident.\n\nFidelia said Anele thereafter ordered her to change into her NYSC uniform after which she asked some corps members to fetch water and sand with which she used to bathe her as captured in the viral video.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "LoftyInc, early investor in Andela, doesn\u2019t play by the rules of VC investing",
          "text": "\u201cOh God of creation, direct our noble cause\n\nGuide our leaders right\n\nHelp our youth the truth to know\n\nIn love and honesty to grow\n\nAnd living just and true\n\nGreat lofty heights attain\n\nTo build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.\u201d\n\nForty-three years ago, this version of the Nigerian national anthem (second stanza) was created. Like many other Nigerians, Idris Bello and Michael Oluwagbemi grew up singing it, not knowing that a line from the anthem would later inspire the name for their future pan-African venture capital firm, LoftyInc Capital Management.\n\nThe journey of LoftyInc started about 10 years ago with a simple desire to help young Africans turn lofty ideas into global corporations that would create high-impact jobs and transcend development challenges.\n\nIn 2010, Bello and Oluwagbemi were engineers working in the US and met after an interview on entrepreneurship Bello had granted during a visit to Nigeria. Upon realizing they had the same idea and could do more together, they decided to partner.\n\n\u201cWhen we decided to start supporting businesses, we didn\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Bello said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any template or roadmap. We just knew we wanted to create more jobs and prosperity for people, and we set out to do something.\u201d\n\nBack then, the popular way to support businesses was through innovation hubs. The duo looked to iHub in Kenya, YCombinator in the US and a few hubs in Houston for inspiration.\n\nThe solution they arrived at was what birthed the Wennovation Hub, a place where people could gather to collectively solve the common problems they faced. The approach then was to bring people together to talk about the problems they faced in their different sectors, with the hope that they\u2019d figure out the right questions and solutions.\n\nAlong the way, they noticed that after talking about the problems and stumbling on solutions, the ideas needed funding to take off. This led the duo on a long and experimental expedition to build what is now known as LoftyInc Capital Management.\n\nToday, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella. It recently launched its third $10 million fund.\n\nIdris Bello with Rasha and Doa of Chefaa, Egypt\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did LoftyInc Capital Management start?\n\nIdris Bello: Michael and I met because we shared a similar interest in solving problems in Africa. We aligned on a clear belief that entrepreneurship is the answer.\n\nThe turning point for us was in 2011 when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had a programme called Accelerating Information Technology Initiative (AITI). This programme involved sending coders (they weren\u2019t called developers back then) to teach people at the University of Ibadan programming. We heard about this and said we\u2019d partner with MIT on the business side of things by working with the persons trained in programming to bring some of their ideas to life. The first set of startups we invested in came from this programme.\n\nIt was while working on the business aspect that we realized these businesses also need money to run.\n\nSo we decided to look back home. We decided to pool funds from different people (angel investors). I remember sending the first email to Tomi Davies and other industry leaders to form what has now become the Lagos Angel Network. Kudos to Tomi Davies and others who have done an amazing job building that up to form the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nAfter a while, we noticed that it took too long to invest in the startups. Back then LAN used to invest in companies twice a year. By the time we were done with due diligence six months down the line after committing to invest, the companies were probably dead.\n\nSo I said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t sustainable. We need to start investing on a more frequent basis.\u201d Michael and I took out money from our 401k (retirement savings) to invest. It was a risky move because we weren\u2019t supposed to touch the money until we were 59 years old.\n\nWe also got other people to start the Afropreneurs Angel Group, a group of angel investors, who invested on a more frequent basis. Notably, the first investment we made from here was in Hutbay, a startup that recently shut down. We went on to invest in more startups that mostly died, but fortunately, a few that survived, like Andela and Flutterwave, have compensated for the ones that died.\n\nWhile we were investing via the Afropreneurs Angel Group, our long time advisor Masha Wulff (a veteran US investor), suggested that we set up a proper VC fund. We were at first reluctant because we didn\u2019t set out to become venture capitalists. In fact, if you were to ask me 4-5 years ago about the normal things that a VC or investment banker should know, I didn\u2019t know them.\n\nBut Wulff was persistent and we gave in. This incentivized her to decide to come out of retirement to be a general partner for Fund 2, committing $500,000 of her own money to the fund. We ended up raising a little over $1 million and further invested in six companies \u2014 Printivo, RelianceHMO, Epump, YouVerify, Shyft Power Solutions and Flutterwave (at pre-Series A).\n\nIdris Bello, Michael Oluwagbemi and Masha Wulff\n\nDA: What\u2019s your approach to investing in startups?\n\nIB: In early-stage investing, founders are crucial, so we believe in backing good founders. We believe that good founders will always find a way. It\u2019s not necessarily about the business model, because startups often pivot.\n\nI remember telling Iyin Aboyeji early on when I was investing in his first venture that even if he doesn\u2019t return my money, he should take it as payment for his MBA. Fortunately, he\u2019s given us great returns on the many investments we made. I say this to point out that the way I see it is we\u2019re investing in the ecosystem. So even if a company fails, the founders and employees can go on to work at other startups and go on to build the African tech ecosystem.\n\nWe use our experience at the launch and early growth phases to closely support and assist new and early founders. We often help to source and secure their initial clients from within our large portfolio (over 75 African startups) or further afield within our large African-based Angel and Limited Partner (LP) network. We provide meaningful introductions to regulators, partners, mentors, top hires and experienced board directors.\n\nWhile we\u2019re sector-agnostic, we have 6 thematic areas of focus: Commerce, Financial logistics, Food security, Health/Wellbeing, and Education. We believe businesses in these areas help spur the general prosperity of a nation and people at large.\n\nIdris and Michael with Kabiru of Sudo\n\nDA: Tell me about notable deals missed or mistakes made?\n\nIB: Oh sure! Those are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\nMost of the mistakes we made were a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 check. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\n\nWhen I look back at these mistakes, it was easier to get through because we used our personal money in the early days and we weren\u2019t crazy about exits. We did what we did because we believed supporting businesses was the way to solve Africa\u2019s problems. And today, when we see startups like Andela employing thousands of people in emerging markets, and impacting lives globally, we feel very fulfilled. People returns, then money returns. That is the goal!\n\nIdris Bello with Jeremy Johnson of Andela\n\nDA: I remember earlier this year you spoke online about a bad experience with a founder. How often do those happen, and can you share any experiences?\n\nIB: That\u2019s right, there are bad experiences and it\u2019s important to share them. These days all that\u2019s shared are the success stories, which is only half of the picture.\n\nWithout mentioning any names, we\u2019ve had a situation where some founders disappeared after getting $5,000 investment only to show up after 3 years begging for forgiveness. Small money, but I guess they had more pressing needs.\n\nThere\u2019s one startup that recently shut down primarily because the CEO relocated permanently to Canada without carrying us along, yet refused to let go of leadership. They\u2019d blame it on COVID but it wasn\u2019t COVID.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019d like to say that in this space, we have no issues with startups not working out, but then what\u2019s more important is that the founder communicates well and operates with integrity.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits?\n\nIB: When it comes to early-stage investing, my belief is that a bird in hand is the only bird. The tides can change for any company, so the only thing that\u2019s certain is money received based on exit, not expected return based on valuation. Earlier this year, our Fund 2 exited Flutterwave and returned 3x of total funds raised to our limited partners (LPs). Some people felt it was too soon and we should have waited. But the way I look at it, it\u2019s necessary to return funds to the backers of early-stage funds to boost their confidence. For a 5-year fund, in just three years, we returned 3x. The result of this was that these LPs were so impressed that they pressured us for a new fund and made commitments of over $4m to get it started.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note here that we don\u2019t play by the \u201crules\u201d. Every now and then, we ask ourselves, \u201cWho created the rules that you have to wait 5 years or that you have to return 10x the investment?\u201d For me, as long as my LPs are happy and the startups are doing fine, I\u2019m okay. It is still Day 1 in the African early-stage investment space and we are all learning as we go. VC Investing in Africa is still nascent and we\u2019re all still figuring it out. There are no experts.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing?\n\nIB: For me, there are three things I\u2019m bullish about going forward. The first is bringing Egyptian and Nigerian companies together. These are two of Africa\u2019s largest markets. I believe there should be more collaboration, considering that Egypt has a matured stock market and Nigeria has many notable startups. I believe this type of collaboration will bring about more mergers and acquisitions. It\u2019ll help create a secondary market for investors to exit.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019m excited about is investing outside of the Big Four \u2014 Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt. We\u2019ve recently invested in a Zambian startup and are doubling down on investing in Francophone African countries. We like to stay ahead of the curve. Egypt is hot right now, but I remember a few years ago when I started investing in Egypt, I was telling people to do the same and it looked like I was insane.\n\nIdris Bello with Yaw Bediako of Yemaachi\n\nFinally, as many people \u201cjapa\u201d (exit) the continent in search of greener pastures in the West, it\u2019s expected that some of them will go on to start businesses. We\u2019re keeping our eyes on the diaspora market.\n\nOne of my biggest joys over the past few years has been the large number of senior African executives and experienced operators we\u2019ve turned into investors, either as angel investors or LPs. These African investors then spend lots of their time helping us with due diligence and supporting our portfolio companies. Again, this is all part of building the African tech ecosystem: activating Africans to fund Africans solving African problems.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Andela, a global engineering talent outsourcing company, has secured $200 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series E funding round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, the venture capital arm of Japanese conglomerate \u2013 SoftBank.\n\nThis funding round brings the total venture funding raised by Andela to $380 million. Alongside Softbank, the round included Whale Rock, a new investor and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Spark Capital.\n\n\u201cAndela has always been the high-quality option for those building remote engineering teams. Now that the world has come to embrace remote work, Andela has become the obvious choice for companies because we can find better talent, faster,\u201d said Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela. \u201cIf you are a talented engineer, Andela opens up a world of possibilities for you, no matter where you are based.\u201d\n\nIn view of this announcement, Lydia Jett, Founding Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and one of the most respected consumer technology investors in the world, will join Andela\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology. Two years after it launched the company got a $24 million infusion, led by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who followed up with a visit.\n\nL \u2013 R: Brice Nkengsa, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Ian Carnevale, Christina Sass, Jeremy Johnson, and Nadayar Enegesi co-founded Andela in September 2014. Image credit: Andela\n\nIn July 2020, Andela changed its model, closing its physical offices in Nigeria, Uganda and Rwanda to become a fully remote company. The particular rationale at the time was to increase the number of Africans who could apply to work for the company as software developers. Almost a year later, it expanded its talent pool to welcome Latin and South American developers.\n\nToday, the company boasts of a network of engineers from more than 80 countries and six continents.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on who you follow and your close circle on the Internet, you\u2019re probably sick of hearing blockchain enthusiasts throw jargon like \u201cNFT,\u201d \u201cmining,\u201d \u201cngmi,\u201d \u201cburning,\u201d \u201cdestroying,\u201d trading,\u201d et cetera all around.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not code for soldiers to communicate in World War III. They\u2019re actual terms understood by blockchain enthusiasts, one of the most popular being NFT. But, what\u2019s an NFT?\n\nNFT is an acronym for Non-fungible token. Non-fungible implies one-of-a-kind, unique, or irreplaceable.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had someone tell you that you\u2019re one of a kind and irreplaceable, congratulations, you\u2019ve been called Non-fungible before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut think about it, human beings are Non-fungible. I mean, we might look alike in our respective physical makeups, but we each have unique genes and experiences that make us the only kind of ourselves.\n\nWhere were we? Yes, NFTs. An NFT can be anything, for the most part. Just as you\u2019re one of your kind and consist of flesh, blood, and bones, NFTs are mostly digitally converted or digitally generated pieces (or even real-world items, although this is less common) of anything that exists as the only copy of its kind and cannot be replaced.\n\nThey can be artworks, memes, music, videos, sounds, and even tweets. After all, Twitter Founder Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million.\n\nIt could be a video of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s first goal or digitally converted manuscripts of Maya Angelou\u2019s works.\n\nPicture Leonardo da Vinci drawing the Mona Lisa in 2021, and it\u2019s a digital painting minted on an NFT platform; whoever he sells the painting to becomes the original owner.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAs a creator or original owner, you sell the ownership of the item you NFTed, and the buyer becomes the owner of the original.\n\nPayments can be made with cryptocurrency or a fiat currency equivalent. And it\u2019s important to note that the artist/creator can still hold the right to reproduce.\n\nThink of it as owning the original Mona Lisa. There are several fakes everywhere, but there\u2019s one original.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom a digital stance, someone might as well download the same copy of the art, but most NFTs run on the Ethereum Blockchain. And the uniqueness of an NFT is based on complex lines of nodes \u2014 a kind of code \u2014 on this blockchain that signify ownership, originality, and irreplaceability.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain network on which you can record and verify transactions without a third party, among other things. It has its native cryptocurrency called Ether.\n\nAre NFTs cryptocurrencies?\n\nWell, yes and no. Remember we\u2019ve agreed that it\u2019s only an NFT if there\u2019s one of its kind? If you have 0.003 BTC and I have 0.003 BTC, we have the same thing. But when you have an NFT, it\u2019s unique. No one else has anything like it.\n\nThink of them as crypto assets. Just as there are real-life assets like land or artefacts, specific data written in a line of complex code represents the value and worth of these digital assets.\n\nCan the average Joe buy and sell NFTs?\n\nYes. Whether you\u2019re an artist, a collector, an art enthusiast, or just someone looking to own a viable asset, you can join the moving train.\n\nFor artists, once you can prove that you\u2019re the creator/original owner of that token, then you can sell on an NFT platform. And whenever the NFT is traded, you receive a payment.\n\nAs a buyer or collector, you can buy on a reputable NFT platform for keepsake, and later on, mint them for their money\u2019s worth.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that being a relatively novel idea, the market is quite volatile and unpredictable, and as with decisions involving finances, it\u2019s important to educate yourself.\n\nSince most NFTs run on the Ethereum Blockchain, you\u2019d need to set up a wallet \u2014 the most common being MetaMask \u2014 and have some Ethereum in it to start minting your NFT. Each platform has its unique requirements.\n\nNFTs date back to crypto art, a craze that began in 2013, one of which was the now almost obsolete coloured coins \u2014 a bitcoin-issued token used to verify transactions \u2014 used as proof of ownership for real-world assets, from equities to bonds to real estate. This was in an attempt to expand the use of the blockchain to the real world.\n\nAn artist couple, Kevin McCoy and Jennifer McCoy, minted Quantum, the first NFT. It was a pixelated image of an octagon filled with various shapes at the centre. At the time of writing, it costs $7 million to get an original of this art piece.\n\nThis idea has spread widely for varying reasons. Not only does it allow direct control and a more transparent way to track assets, but it also helps artists monetise their works and helps art enthusiasts support them.\n\nAnd because the blockchain records transactions in an unchangeable way, NFTs serve as trustable proof of ownership and originality.\n\nA few weeks ago, we covered the story of a Nigerian artist, Anthony Azekwoh, who made more than he ever had in his career when he first minted his art as an NFT, making Six Eth (equivalent to $11,046 when the article was published) in the process.\n\nThere have been many speculations about whether this is the future of buying, selling, and collecting art. While the future is not set in stone, it looks like NFTs are here to stay and change the narrative of the art business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "title": "This is the time to build the architecture for Africa\u2019s future \u2013 Ndubuisi Ekekwe on funding startups in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a child, Ndubuisi Ekekwe realised that excelling in his education was a guaranteed path to influence. That realisation drove him to apply himself, eventually resulting in him studying electrical and electronics engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at various companies, including Diamond Bank and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) before moving to the US where he obtained a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Subsequently, he taught at Carnegie Mellon University before founding companies operating in the technology space.\n\nIn December 2020, Professor Ekekwe published an article on the Tekedia website, which he titled, \u201cFintechnolization of Platforms \u2013 Expect this Redesign in Startups.\u201d In the article, he argued that every digital platform would have to offer a financial service at some point if it must capture massive value.\n\nIn January 2021, he launched Tekedia Capital, an investment syndicate that allows individuals to invest in companies operating largely in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I made that postulation, I thought, \u2018if I have written this, how do I demonstrate that I\u2019m walking the talk?\u2019 So, that is how I started thinking about building our fintech solution within our ecosystem since, to a large extent, we have a couple of thousands of people here. That was how Tekedia Capital came about.\u201d\n\nStarting Tekedia Capital was not just about making money though. It was also driven by a desire to support a generation of African entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cI will say, to a large extent, that I am optimistic about this Cambrian moment of entrepreneurial capitalism in Africa. That this is the time to build the architecture for the new African future and having the right capital will make sure that the entrepreneurs will be successful in doing that.\u201d\n\nEkekwe is quick to point out that Tekedia Capital is not a VC fund but an investment syndicate. On the reason for choosing this model, he points out that becoming a VC fund increases ticket sizes and could result in worrying about big exits, adding that investing smaller amounts improves the chance of being bought out by bigger investors at subsequent raises.\n\nWith most members of the syndicate being angel investors, this flexibility is key.\n\n\u201cMost people who are still investing at a personal level want to have that flexibility but VCs may like it to get very big.\u201d\n\nEven with this, the firm does not invest less than $70,000 in startups, often going as high as $700,000.\n\nHow Tekedia Capital works\n\nWith an annual fee of $1,000, or its local equivalent, investors get access to Tekedia Capital\u2019s deal flow for four investment cycles or 12 months in situations where Tekedia Capital does not have up to four investment cycles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor investors in the syndicate, the minimum investment in a startup is $10,000 or its local equivalent. In addition to the $1,000 required to gain access, Tekedia Capital charges a 20% carried interest of the invested amount.\n\nSince its launch, the syndicate has invested in up to ten startups, including Y Combinator portfolio company, Mecho Autotech; on-demand helicopter booking startup Vetifly; and online checkout startup, OurPass. Investments in startups are determined by members of the syndicate and not Tekedia Capital.\n\nIt operates a lean model with a small team that sources and vets deals before presenting them to the syndicate\u2019s members.\n\nMembers of the syndicate come from various professional backgrounds, and this means that Tekedia Capital can get professional advice from someone with experience in a sector before investing.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nTekedia Capital invests in early-stage technology-anchored startups with most of their operations based in Africa. It is also sector-agnostic although there is a bias towards startups that are hard to automate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a company that someone in Silicon Valley will automate. So, you\u2019re not going to see us invest in businesses like Twitter or Instagram because there is no inherent geographical advantage that it gives you as an innovator in Lagos. You have to be physically present.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Ekekwe discloses that the syndicate picks startups with teams that show the required technical and managerial abilities. The team must also be able to go beyond customer acquisition to making fans of their customers.\n\nIn my conversations with early-stage investors, a common thought expressed is how there is very little data available on a startup that could aid the due diligence process and so in many cases, the decision on whether to invest in a startup could come down to the founder.\n\nEkekwe reveals that beyond a founder\u2019s technical or managerial capabilities, it is important to know what motivates the person.\n\n\u201cI like to know our startup founders. I don\u2019t want to invest in someone whose motivations I don\u2019t understand. I just want to know if this is a guy that will stop picking calls if you send him $300,000 so we put significant effort into trying to understand exactly who our founders are.\u201d\n\nFounders who meet Tekedia Capital\u2019s requirements can apply for investment by sending an email to capital@fasmicro.com.\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s future\n\nAfrica still suffers a huge infrastructural deficit and the capital required to plug the hole means that only a few entrepreneurs would bother with it. Ekekwe understands this and points out that despite the growth experienced by software startups, those are not the innovations that would ultimately drive Africa\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity in Africa today is building infrastructure but they don\u2019t bring in a lot of money. We need to build seaports, better broadband in rural communities, a better logistics system that will make eCommerce work, and we also need electricity that works. These are the infrastructure that power innovation but you don\u2019t expect small VCs or entrepreneurs to deal with that. However, those are the things that will facilitate Africa\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding that entrepreneurs cannot be expected to drive this growth, he expressed hope that as more exits are recorded in the startup scene, more founders will be willing to take on projects of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerian businesses need to adopt innovative practices and address gaps in business practice in order to thrive amid the uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Michael Raynor, a renowned business strategist.\n\nRaynor is the author of \u201cThe Strategy Paradox: Why Committing to Success Leads to Failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Raynor, who spoke at BusinessDay\u2019s CEO Forum Thursday, successful innovation means breaking constraints in the right way.\n\nHighlighted that in the hospitality industry, using Airbnb as an example, he said hotels were constrained with having to build in locations with low reach and cost implications, but with the right innovation, those constraints were taken out.\n\nAirbnb mobilised dead assets and provided more options with affordability and is fast thriving, Raynor said.\n\nThis, he said, shows how innovation and product offerings act as major determinants of how well positioned a business will be in the market.\n\n\u201cProvided your solution has a successful strategy, embraces certain constraints to be different and delivers unique value to a specific segment, your company will thrive,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: Brain drain leaves future of Nigeria at risk but Singapore\u2019s strategy offers way out\n\nRaynor also said businesses that want to become high performers should first identify successful companies and conduct research about them. This way they can understand what drives high performance and emulate practices gathered from the findings.\u201d\n\nRaynor said although businesses aim for sustainability, no organisation lives forever neither can they stay the same for as long as it survives, so the objective is to change as it is required and last as long as possible.\n\nWith a reputation for helping companies escape the whims of chance, which can upend the best-executed strategy, Raynor is an authority in business strategy.\n\nRaynor, who was described by the Financial Times as \u201cone of the most articulate and interesting thought leaders in innovation today,\u201d brings a unique data-driven approach to the development and implementation of cutting-edge concepts.\n\nAfter performing a statistical analysis of more than 25,000 companies over more than 40 years, Raynor said during his presentation at the conference that there were just three rules companies need to abide by to excel.\n\nFirst, they must strive to offer better products and services before price. Those who compete on differentiators rather than price stand a better chance of standing out and succeeding in the long term.\n\nSecond, they need to put revenues above cost. In other words, they must prioritise increasing revenue over reducing costs.\n\nFinally, there are no other rules so companies must embrace disrupting their business models and standard practices to achieve the first and second principles.",

          "text": "Five out of 10 Nigerian registered doctors abandoned Africa\u2019s most populous country in 2020, in search of countries willing to offer more for their services.\n\nThe trend is the same with other professions, a threat to the future development of a country projected by the United Nations (UN) to become the world\u2019s third most populous nation by 2050.\n\nNigeria is not the only country that has had to struggle with losing its best brains to more developed countries, Singapore\u2019s strategy holds some lessons on how Nigeria can reverse its brain drain syndrome.\n\nHuman capital is one of the greatest resources of African countries, particularly Nigeria, the continent\u2019s most populous nation, but when they leave and don\u2019t return the future of the continent is at risk, according to Jean-Michel Paul, CEO of Acheron Capital, who spoke at the BusinessDay CEO Forum, Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhen an engineer goes abroad and doesn\u2019t return, we don\u2019t just lose one but a thousand and same for other professions,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Paul, who is also an award-winning author, Africa is blessed with the right people but if they leave, it will be very difficult to build the future.\n\n\u201cTaking out the best brains is taking a mortgage on the future because this is a real resource,\u201d Paul said.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), about 2,000 medical workers leave the country annually to developed countries with the majority leaving as a result of low wages and difficult working and living conditions.\n\nRead also: Currency printing signals breakdown of financial system- Acheron Capital CEO\n\nThe NMA also reported in 2020 that out of 75,000 doctors officially registered in Nigeria, over 33,000 left the country leaving just above 50 percent of that number to man the health institutions in the country.\n\nAccording to the US government census data, the Nigerian diaspora is overall the best-educated and its members are more than twice as likely to have secured an advanced degree. Nigerians are also more likely than the general American population to work in professional or managerial occupations.\n\nBrain drain refers to the large-scale emigration of educated and high-skilled individuals from their birth country.\n\nSingapore\u2019s brain drain\n\nLess than a decade ago, six in 10 Singaporean employees were willing to leave the country for a better job. Data by Randstad Workmonitor research, a survey company that covers local and global trends in mobility, job satisfaction and motivation in 34 markets around the globe, showed that Singapore\u2019s brain drain rate was higher than the global average.\n\nThe Lion City\u2019s brain drain rate, according to the Workmonitor, was higher than the global average of 50 percent.\n\nAlso, 42 percent of young Singaporeans polled by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) in 2010 said emigration was often on their minds, and 26 percent was also actively exploring avenues to emigrate.\n\nThose that went to school abroad did not want to return as they earned more in foreign countries than back at home. The social class and title that came with working and earning in foreign currency was another incentive for the brain drain.\n\nThe government of the once poor country began to implement strategies to reverse the brain drain.\n\n\u201cThe leadership at the time clearly understood that education was key to the future and development, so they came up with a bright idea to let a lot of young people go get some extra level of education abroad that will be sponsored by the government, but the abroad trained Singaporean would have to come back and work for a certain number of years.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Paul said the government told them it\u2019ll pay, for example, a one-year master\u2019s programme in the UK or some other country but would have to come work in the government for four years or eight years in the private sector.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen afterwards is the singular economic miracle of a very poor island that is now doing very well, thanks to the educated elite that returned to the country,\u201d Paul said.\n\nWhat Nigeria can learn\n\nNigeria can draw a cue from Singapore by following in the same footsteps or come up with its own strategy that can help retain its best minds.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s strategy of creating job opportunities with adequate remuneration, providing subsidised training for citizens to improve their employability and also improving the overall quality of life of its citizens is another idea that holds lessons for Nigeria.\n\nThere is an argument about diaspora remittances into Nigeria resulting from its brain drain.\n\nThe inflow of diaspora remittances is one of the perks of brain drain from which Nigeria benefits. It represents household income from foreign economies arising mainly from the temporary or permanent movement of people to developed economies.\n\nResponding to the diaspora remittance and brain drain, Andrew Nelvin, chief economist at PwC, said Nigeria needed to export brains and not people.\n\n\u201cWe can have educated Nigerians earning foreign exchange for the country without leaving the country, companies like Google and Facebook are setting up more developments in Nigeria because they recognise how talented Nigerians are,\u201d Nevin said.\n\nIt is no surprise Singapore has the highest human capital index in the world at 0.9 while Nigeria has one of the lowest human capital index in the world, at (0.36) its ranks 168th out of the 174 countries surveyed, only better than Liberia (0.32), Mali (0.32), South Sudan (0.31), Chad (0.30) and Niger (0.29).\n\nThe human capital index measures which countries are best in mobilising the economic and professional potential of their citizens. Human capital is majorly measured by the health and education of the people.\n\nIn 2020, the Bloomberg Health-Efficiency Index, which tracks life expectancy and medical spending, ranked Singapore first in the world for the most efficient healthcare.\n\nHowever, in Nigeria, 20 percent of the children do not live till their fifth birthday due to the lack of basic facilities. Nigerians also have one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the world at 54.81 years.\n\nNigeria can draw a cue from Singapore by investing in the health and education of its citizens and offering incentives to keep its professionals.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has commended security agencies for the improved security in the state, noting that the synergy between the state government and the agencies has continued to yield positive results, including reduction in the incidence of kidnapping along the Benin-Auchi Expressway.\n\nObaseki, who stated this while addressing journalists shortly after the monthly security meeting with heads of security agencies in the state, said there has been no report of kidnapping on the Benin-Ekpoma Road in the period under review.\n\nHe said the security agencies have been able to dislodge the kidnappers on the road, as there has been a significant drop in the activities of criminals.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have reviewed the data for crime from the 1st till today, 30th of September and we found a slight improvement in security in the state, with about 101 incidents compared to last month, which was slightly higher.\n\n\u201cKidnapping still tops the list of crimes, followed by homicides and drugs. We noticed that this month, the security agencies have been able to dislodge kidnappers from the Benin-Ekpoma axis for the period under review as there was no incident of kidnapping between Benin and Ekpoma.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have enough intelligence. They are working very hard to ensure they stamp out every incident of kidnapping from the state. We also reviewed the issue of accidents; we are very worried and concerned.\n\n\u201cYou heard about the unfortunate incident of the road accident a couple of weeks ago that claimed almost seven lives. We have given orders to the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Nigerian Police to make sure that the drivers of those vehicles are brought to book and arraigned latest by next week.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Commissioner of Police in Edo, Mr. Philip Ogbadu, who reassured the commitment of the security agencies to the security of lives and property of citizens, stated: \u201cWe have already drawn an operation for the ember months.

You have helped us to do things professionally; we are not afraid to put out our data; the data that we put out in Edo can stand the test of time anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur experience from the outbreak of coronavirus showed us that the healthcare system in Edo is one.

          "text": "Oluwatoyin A Olojo, author of Beauty For Ashes, an outstanding book published by Parousia in 2021, has said she was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the book.\n\nOlojo in this interview talks about her new book and her journey into literary world.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhy did you decide to write Beauty for Ashes? Is there something specifically that spurred you to write this book?\n\nWriting Beauty for Ashes was strictly by the instruction of the Holy Spirit. First, I received the title, then the launch date which was just six months away, then the chapter by chapter title as well as their subtitles\u2026 It was indeed divinely orchestrated.\n\nHave you always had it in mind that you\u2019d write a book; be an author?\n\nI have always loved to write. I have always had a private journal, I even had a slum book in back secondary school and I always found a way to express my thoughts in writing. However, I never intended being an author; a poet maybe, but not an author.\n\nYour book is a book that holds a deep message. Tell us about the message you are trying to pass across with Beauty For Ashes.\n\nYou know, when the Holy Spirit first told me about Beauty for Ashes, He said it was going to be an expression of my life\u2019s story. I kept asking what story my life was telling and He said, everyone has a story to tell. That period, I was going through a lot to redefining moments in my life, which involved getting hurt and recovering. I also realised that I\u2019ve always had a deep compassion for young ladies who somehow ended up becoming slaves to sex either intentionally or not.\n\nThe main focus of Beauty for Ashes is salvation and healing. This is why the book comes with a workbook to help readers answer salient questions about themselves and a devotional to help guide them through.\n\nAfter this book, do you still have it in mind to publish a new book? And when should we be expecting it?\n\nYes yes yes! The deep treatment each chapter in Beauty for Ashes gives, started with me. Beauty for Ashes was an opening to my calling as a Scribe according to Matthew 13:52. It\u2019s a deep calling as several other book titles have been received and are awaiting the divine instruction to \u201cGO!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure some of our aspiring authors will love to know this. What was your greatest motivation in publishing this book, what was the process like?\n\nWell, considering the genre I\u2019m called to write which is spiritual and can be sometimes satirical, I would say it takes having a burden to give a big release. The depth of your burden will fuel your sense of urgency and give you all the push or motivation you need. There were times I broke down in tears while writing Beauty for Ashes, especially in Cactus and Sunflower, It was indeed a process! The whole message started with me! Letting out all that information about myself left me with zero shame and that in turn birthed \u201cThe Shame-free Tribe\u201d. My biggest motivation was my burden to see freedom, healing and salvation.\n\nApart from the publication by the publisher, what step do you take to make sure your book get out there? Tell us about the book launch.\n\nHonestly, publicising the book has not been quite easy but I have made sure to have an author\u2019s website in my name where articles relating to the book and other interests are often posted. The homepage carries the book image and everyone who visits the site gets to see the book first.\n\nThe book launch was more of a small, private event. I believe in starting small and as such was glad to have a controllable crowd of about 35 persons in attendance. It was tagged \u201cthe release of a book, of pain and of sounds of worship\u201d. All we did, majorly, was worship God. We also watched video clips of people\u2019s stories of sexual abuse and how they overcame the pain. Some guests also shared their stories of how they were raped, nearly raped and victimized. It was indeed a release of pain.\n\nTell us about your experience with your Publisher, Parousia Reads.\n\nParousia Reads has one endearing factor which is accuracy. The team knows how well to get in your head and replicate your exact same ideas you have. When I saw my book cover design, I began to ask if there was someone else present when the Spirit of the Lord showed me the image. They were also considerate of a first time author that I was and made every step less burdensome. Thank you Parousia Reads! Thank you Samuel Tola Ijalusi!\n\nSo far, how has the experience been? And what do you intend to do after now?\n\nThe experience has been transforming! Beauty for Ashes has called forth other assignments and I\u2019m super grateful to God for trusting me with this vision. After now, asides sending thousands of sponsored copies to teenagers and commercial sex workers across Nations, I also hope to flesh up the skeletal framework of The Shame-free Tribe.\n\nI still write copies, proposals and contents for businesses, I still write poems, articles and blog posts, and I still sell insurance and give investment advice. All these and more I\u2019ll continue to do even while I focus on my education. Ultimately, I intend to love on God!\n\nYou can purchase this book on these platforms\n\nAMAZON\n\nOKADABOOKS\n\nADLIBRIS\n\nDIDERICH",

          "title": "Osun 2022: Gladiators challenge for Oyetola\u2019s throne",
          "text": "Olusesan Laoye\n\nThe political atmosphere in Osun State has continued to hot up ahead of the governorship election billed for July 16, 2022, as leading political figures in the state position to challenge the incumbent governor, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola who is seeking a second term in office.\n\nAlthough there are more than 15 political parties in the state, two major ones, the All Progressives Congress(APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) are prominent and each has been battling to outwith and outshine the other.\n\nThe gladiators who are angling to step into Oyetola\u2019s shoes have been engaging in one activity or the other, even as the battle has continued to cause crisis within the ranks of each of the leading parties.\n\nIn the APC for instance, the election is causing serious battle between the immediate past Governor of the State, who is currently the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola and the incumbent Oyetola.\n\nThe battle between them has been very intense to the extent that it has split the party into two strong factions, as those in Aregbesola\u2019s camp are saying loud and clear that they would not back Oyetola for a second term, an indication that the primary of the party for the election is bound to be volatile.\n\nThis is the period that the two factions would prove how strong and relevant they are, though Oyetola as the governor may want to use the State apparatus at his disposal to ensure he coast home to winning the ticket of the party, Aregbesola\u2019s camp too from the feelers in the State are waiting to show how strong they are.\n\nIn PDP as well, the battle will not be easy. In fact that is the party where there are more prominent personalities jostling for ticket.\n\nThose known to have shown interests are not pushovers, as they have all it takes to go all the way.\n\nWith these in mind, we look at the gladiators and their pedigree.\n\nOyetola\n\nIt is glaring that the present governor Gboyega Oyetola of the APC is going to seek reelection. He has been doing everything to show that he is all out to win the ticket of the party and this has informed all his actions lately, with him stamping his authorities as the incumbent and as well uprooting whatever obstacles that could come his way either in his party or outside it.\n\nOne major obstacle which Oyetola would have to clear is the rift between him and his former boss Aregbesola.\n\nAlthough they both belong to the same political godfather, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, they don\u2019t seem to agree on anything.\n\nIt is, however, said that there is the likelihood of the duo being united by the leaders within the state and Abuja before the primaries as the APC would not want to lose the state to the opposition.\n\nSince Oyetola succeeded Aregbesola in 2018, the APC has been in disarray. There has been no love lost between the political camps of the two politicians, despite the fact that both have been constantly denying that there is any rift between them.\n\nBut some moves by the two politicians as well as the actions and body language of their supporters have been reflecting that they are not on one page as far politics is concerned.\n\nDespite their denials, top members of the party had one time or the other called them to a round table, urging them to come together as brothers and member of one family. Unfortunately, the more they tried to settle them, the more the rifts escalate.\n\nBoth Chief Bisi Akande and Asiwaju Tinubu had made several attempts to reconcile them but up till now not much has been achieved.\n\nIt is being speculated that with the ongoing crisis between Oyetola and Aregbesola, the chances of Oyetola clinching the ticket of the party is slim, but those in his camp are in no doubt.\n\nOne of his aides confined in Business Hallmark that with the entire machinery of the party now in his hand, and so no one can stop him.\n\nHe said the the second term ticket of Oyetola is already settled and that is why members of the party across the state have endorsed him for second term.\n\n\u201cFrom what is on ground, he would eventually emerge as the consensus candidate of the party and there is nothing the gang up by those in Aregbesola\u2019s camp can do to prevent him,\u201d the source said.\n\nRight now, only Oyetola\u2019s name is prominent in APC. Political observers say that when the time actually comes, more people within the party would come out and those who are likely to show interest would be from the other group loyal to Aregbesola.\n\nIn the PDP, those interested have not hidden their intention. From the arrays and the growing list of contenders, the party is parading the majority of those who fought for the ticket of the party in 2018. They include:\n\nAdemola Adeleke\n\nHe appears to be the top on the list and he has never relented since he contested under the platform of the party in 2018\n\nAlthough he won the election glaringly at the first ballot, the election was declared inconclusive and there had to be a rerun which he lost narrowly to Oyetola.\n\nAlthough he came out in 2018 in a controversial manner, battling such issues as questionable certificate, among others, this time around he may have overcome that because immediately after the election, he moved to the United States of America to perfect his certificate issue.\n\nHe is said to have now obtained a degree which he will be parading.\n\nThe successful completion of his studies in the US was celebrated and showcased to let the people know that he is a different Demola ready to fight on.\n\nOn his return to Nigeria with funfair he, disclosed that he is ready to flag off his campaign without blocking those interested in contesting for the PDP governorship ticket, saying that whoever is interested in should join him as he told Governor Oyetola to start preparing his handover notes.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party has messed up the state since coming to power. I am appealing to the Governor, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola to start preparing his handover notes because his days as Governor are numbered,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am back and ready to kick start my campaign. PDP belongs to everyone, I can\u2019t stop anyone interested in the party\u2019s ticket from contesting it, but l appeal for decency among everyone for peace within the party and the state.\u201d\n\nWith the support of his brother Deji Adeleke who is expected to bankroll his campaign just as he did last time, Demola is ready to fight to the last and put everything at his disposal to win the ticket of the party.\n\nAkin Ogunbiyi\n\nOgunbiyi is also warming up for the contest like Adeleke.They both contested the primary of the party in 2018.\n\nRecently he lamented that he lost the primary in 2018 and said he is now determined to enter the ring again and fight, claiming that the last primary was manipulated and that he has learnt a lot from that experience.\n\nHe noted that he would be more vigilant this time around to avoid what happened the last time.\n\nHe assured that his newly acquired political experiences will assist him to steer the ship of the state to a promise land.\n\n\u201cI actually won the ticket of the Osun gubernatorial race in 2018 but my political inexperience made me lose it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday, I assure the entire people of Osun state that I will contest in 2022 under the platform of PDP. 2018 has come and gone. It is a fool that will fall and be discouraged. If I had known this much in 2018, I would not have lost. I won glaringly but now the oppressor is the one being oppressed,\u201d\n\nHon. Wole Oke\n\nOne of the pillars of PDP in Osun, Oke is the lawmaker representing Ijesa-North Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives.\n\nHe has shown interest too, and will be looking to outmanoeuvre other aspirants to clinch the opposition party\u2019s ticket.\n\nSome of his associates have said that he is ready to go for the race.\n\nHe appears to be the longest serving member of the House of Representative in Osun State even in Nigeria now, because he is serving his fifth-term at the Green Chamber.\n\nIt was learnt that he has been reaching out to leaders of the party within and outside the state, to inform them of his governorship intention.\n\nHe has the experience, and one of the aspirants well equipped both politically and other wise, for the contest and to rule the state.\n\nAkinlabi Olasunkanmi\n\nSenator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi was a Minister of Youth Development and he too was in the race for the ticket of the party for the 2018 gubernatorial primary.\n\nAt the age of 64, he is capable and as well as an experienced politician.\n\nThe Ode-Omu, Ayedaade Local Government Area born politician who represented Osun West Senatorial district, under the PDP between 2003 and 2007, and later served as Minister of Youth Development from 2007 to 2011, is well battle ready.\n\nThe speculation about Olasunkanmi contesting is very high and sources hinted that he too has been making underground moves, though he has not openly declared his intention.\n\nFatai Akinbade\n\nThis would be his fourth time of coming out for the governorship race. Akinbade had come out previously during Aregbesola\u2019s first and second terms, and he even came out last time under a different political party African Democratic Congress (ADC)\n\nHe served under Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola as the Secretary to the Government (SSG)\n\nThe parties he previously contested are the PDP, during Aregbesola\u2019s first term but lost the primaries to Senator Oyinlola Omisore.\n\nDuring the second terms of Aregbesola he moved to the Labour Party where he ran as the candidates of the party and came third.\n\nPrince Ayoade Adewopo\n\nOf all the aspirants for the coming governorship election, he appears to be the youngest.\n\nHe was in the race for the first time in 2018 and which actually was his first time in the political arena of Nigeria.\n\nHe is a United States and British trained lawyer with a Doctorate Degree; a vibrant energetic young politicians who said he likes to operate where the Lions are.\n\nHe is also the Convener of \u201cAyombo Si Ipinle Osun Movement\u201d,\n\nAdewopo who is fondly called Double Prince with his mother a Princess from Ede and father a Prince from Ife, has been making moves within the state and in Abuja where he is currently making waves and associating with the top brass of his party.\n\nHe had a good showing in the last Primary and up till now, he is still a young and promising politician to watch out for\n\nHe has spread his tentacles across the state and he is regarded as a very close associate and confidant of the Oni of Ife Oba Enitan Ogunwusi\n\nAccording to sources, he has so many things going for him. He commands a very strong respect as a youth who is regarded as very reliable and his tentacles are spread among both the PDP and APC youths who were said to be clamouring for him to come out again.\n\nThough he lost in his bid last time, he still remains a force to be reckoned with because he is regarded as very humble and accommodating.\n\nHe recently grant an interview where he said that he is still very young and ready to lead if given the chance by his party and the people of Osun state.\n\n\u201cLike I said before I am not afraid and being a young man gives me better advantage, and just like others, I have all it takes to govern Osun state,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Musbaudeen Oparinde\n\nHe is of the Young Progressives Party, (YPP) and recently declared his intention to go for the governorship race in 2022.\n\nHe is not well known but says he is ready to take Osun State out of the woods.",

          "text": "Justice Mahmud Abdulgafar of the Kwara State High Court, Ilorin on Thursday imposed 28 years imprisonment on a self-styled Alfa in Ilorin over offences bordering on fraud and obtaining by false pretence, contrary to Section 1(1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006.\n\nThe prison time is to be observed at Mandala Correctional Centre, Ilorin.\n\nJustice Mahmud Abdulgafar while delivering judgment held that the prosecution had tendered enough evidence to convince the court that the self-acclaimed Alfa Jamiu was guilty of the allegations brought against him by the anti-graft agency.\n\nThe Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had on, June 14, 2019 arraigned the defendant on four counts, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nJamiu allegedly presented himself as the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina and a former Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Maikanti Baru, to defraud a South Korean National, Keun Sig Kim to the tune of N30 million.\n\nThe 33-year-old Jamiu, while parading as senior government official deceived the foreign national to collect various sums of money under the pretext of securing for him an NNPC approval/ marketing form and license certificate to buy crude oil in Nigeria.\n\nIn the course of interrogation, Alfa Jamiu claimed that he used the money to conduct sacrifice for the petitioner.\n\nAccording to him, part of the money was used to buy vulture, elephant skin, elephant intestine, skull of a lion and liver of gorilla used as ingredients in the sacrifice.\n\nIn the course of trial, counsel to the EFCC, O. B Akinsola called two witnesses including Detective Dare Folarin who narrated how the defendant was arrested and how several fraudulent funds were traced to his bank accounts.\n\nThe Prosecution tendered evidence on how Jamiu obtained the sum of $88,521.41 from his victim under the guise of helping him to procure approval form from the NNPC. The EFCC also gave account of how the defendant impersonated some senior government officials including the then Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Dr. Maikanti Baru; National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Mrs. Aminat Zakari and Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, among others.\n\nThe defendant did not controvert the charge or the evidence tendered by the EFCC.\n\nJustice Abdulgafar found Jamiu guilty of the four counts brought against him and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment on each count, which is to run concurrently.\n\nIn addition, the judge ordered the forfeiture of some properties recovered from the convict, which are proceeds of his unlawful activities. They are a four bed-room bungalow measuring 1813.132 located at Oke-Foma in Ilorin West Local Government Area of Kwara State, a Toyota Corolla Car, One Plasma Television, Home Theatre, Freezer, Generator, Washing Machine and LG Air Conditioner, to the Federal Government.\n\nThe court also ordered restitution to the victim of the crime.",

          "text": "By Jethro Ibileke\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki, has said that the Edo State Government has not made COVID-19 vaccination compulsory for anyone, a volte-face from his earlier posturing.\n\nHe stated this on Thursday, when he received the Chief Medical Director of the University of UBTH, Prof. Darlington Obaseki, who was on a courtesy visit to the Government House in Benin City.\n\nIn August, Obaseki said his government will enforce a policy of no-vaccination, no-entry into government-owned facilities and public places from the second week of September.\n\nIt was a measure taken to check the 3rd wave of the pandemic that was spreading like wild fire in the State.\n\nThe pronouncement drew criticism from many quarters, including civil society organizations, who dragged the Governor and four others to court.\n\nTrue to the threat, civil servants who could not show proof of being vaccinated were turned back from their offices from the second week of September.\n\nBut at a meeting with CMD of UBTH in his office, the Governor harped on the need for residents to get vaccinated, which he said remains the best form of protection against the virus.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am saddened when I see people not protecting themselves against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe are not making vaccination compulsory, but for now, it is the best way to protect yourselves and protect the people around you.\n\n\u201cGo to any of our isolation centres and see what is happening to people,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe Governor disclosed that his government will sustain reforms in the healthcare system to reposition the state as the country\u2019s medical hub.\n\nHe also assured Prof. Obaseki that the Equity Funds component of the State\u2019s Health Insurance Scheme would be deployed to offset bills of indigent patients at UBTH.\n\nThe governor noted: \u201cWe have no choice but to support you because your success is our success. So, in terms of road rehabilitation in your hospital, we are coming straight to it; we don\u2019t have enough but we will do it.\n\n\u201cI will talk to the Edo Healthcare Insurance Scheme so that we can make funds available from the equity funds to offset the bills of the poorest of the poor who cannot pay for the quality of services you have offered them.\n\n\u201cFor us, we are grateful that we have the UBTH here in this state, as very few states can boast of such a facility. You have helped us to do things professionally; we are not afraid to put out our data; the data that we put out in Edo can stand the test of time anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur experience from the outbreak of coronavirus showed us that the healthcare system in Edo is one. God forbid you fall ill or you have an emergency, it won\u2019t matter where you are treated. At that point, you don\u2019t care if it is a federal, state, or religious institution, as long as you get cured.\n\n\u201cMy standpoint as a governor of Edo is that the healthcare system in Edo is one. Our responsibility is to make sure that every institution here lives up to a minimum standard of quality care and it is also our responsibility to support them to meet up to that minimum standard.\u201d\n\nUBTH CMD, Prof. Darlington Obaseki, commended the Governor for the support which the hospital management has enjoyed under his leadership.",

When we first approached them, we saw that they were holding their warrant, ready to fire.

          "text": "Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) director-general, began the year with a goal of scoring rapid negotiating successes that would help the dysfunctional Geneva-based trade agency regenerate.\n\nAccording to five trade officials in Geneva who declined to be identified, Okonjo-Iweala has fully grasped the frustrating reality of the WTO\u2019s historical lethargy, and has even informally floated the prospect of retiring if no progress can be made on important matters.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala has repeatedly informed ambassadors and employees this year that she might easily leave the post, and that she hasn\u2019t purchased any furnishings for her temporary house in Geneva, according to authorities.\n\nAn early retirement of the WTO\u2019s top trade official would add yet another layer of uncertainty to an organization already beset by existential crises, leading states to conclude that the WTO is no longer a legitimate platform for addressing their common concerns.\n\n\u2018Utterly Ridiculous\u2019\n\nDeep divisions and a lack of trust are not new for the WTO, which requires consensus agreement among all 164 members to finalize multilateral accords.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s rigid negotiating structure and disparate interests of its diverse membership have precluded the organization from delivering anything substantial for the better part of the past decade.\n\nLast year, Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s predecessor \u2014 Roberto Azevedo \u2014 cited the lack of progress at the WTO as his primary reason for resigning from the organization a year before his tenure was scheduled to end.\n\nSome Geneva trade officials told Bloomberg News that they suspect Okonjo-Iweala wants to run in the 2023 presidential election in her native country of Nigeria.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala didn\u2019t comment about her threats to resign but denied any interest in running for the Nigerian presidency, calling such speculation \u201cutterly ridiculous and not true\u201d in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\n\u201cI just got here. I am enjoying what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she told Bloomberg News in a television interview. \u201cIt is a very exciting job and I am trying to have some successes here.\u201d\n\nPolitical Heavyweight\n\nWTO members selected Okonjo-Iweala to be their top trade official on the premise that her energy, ministerial experience and political influence might provide the kind of leadership needed to shake up the beleaguered trade organization.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala arrived with the qualifications of a political heavyweight. With her background as a former developmental economist, a high-ranking World Bank alumnus and the former director of vaccine alliance GAVI \u2014 she is among the most qualified people to lead the organization\u2019s effort to address the Covid-19 vaccine crisis.\n\nHer star has continued to rise since becoming WTO director-general and her focus on vaccine equity has put it in the center of one of the hottest international debates of the pandemic era.\n\nThis month, she was selected for the cover of Time Magazine\u2019s top 100 influential people.\n\nKey Ministerial Meeting\n\nThe true test of Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s leadership will come in November, when she hosts the WTO\u2019s 12th ministerial conference \u2014 a gathering of the organization\u2019s highest decision-making body.\n\nTo date, WTO members have failed to make significant headway on the three priority areas Okonjo-Iweala identified for potential outcomes at the biennial meeting:\n\nan agreement to curb harmful fishery subsidies;\n\na pledge to reduce trade-distorting agricultural policies; and\n\nand a framework to expand global trade in vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nIt\u2019s not for a lack of trying. She has held scores of high-level meetings, interviews and ministerial-level events aimed at rallying WTO members to reach consensus agreements.\n\nWith two months remaining before the ministerial meeting, business and government officials are growing openly pessimistic about the ability of WTO members to agree to anything. Nevertheless, they continue to support Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s efforts and have encouraged her to see the job through.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Dr. Ngozi stepping down early would be anathema to the business community,\u201d Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce John Denton said in an interview. \u201cWe have backed her forward-looking agenda, we want her to commit and maintain that.\n\n\u201cWe see no reason why she would even be thinking about ending her term and frankly \u2014 she has told us point blank that she is not.\u201d",

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Thursday, signed into law the Bill to regulate animal grazing and establishment of Cattle ranching in the state.\n\nAbiodun, who assented to the bill during a Security Council meeting in the State Secretariat at Oke Mosan, Abeokuta, called on the security agencies to swing immediately into action and enforce provisions of the law.\n\nHe said this is a subject matter that has been discussed along the length and breadth of the country and which \u201cwe southern governors have discussed and endorsed\u201d.\n\nOgun, has enjoyed peace among various ethnic nationalities until the recent farmer- herder skirmishes.\n\nCattle rearers, according to Abiodun have a six- month period of grace before it becomes illegal in Ogun state for cattle rearers to occupy unapproved public areas and private land with their livestock for grazing.\n\nThe law also prohibits the act of moving cattle around public places by herders.\n\nA committee headed by the State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Adeola Odedina, has been set up to midwife the implementation and enforcement of the new law.\n\nThe signing of the anti-open grazing law by the governor followed the decision of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum last August, setting the September deadline to pass the law across member states.\n\nThere were pockets of crises witnessed in the state as a result of alleged open grazing in the Yewa axis of the state in April, necessitating the setting up of a peace committee headed by a former House of Representatives, Hon. Kayode Oladele.\n\nThe crises this year pitched Hausa-Fulani settlers against their Yoruba host communities.\n\nIt is expected that the anti-open grazing law will prevent the spread of the menace across the State.\n\nGov. Abiodun said, \u201cBy implication, in six months, it will become unlawful to openly graze cattle or other livestock in the state.\u201d\n\nThe Ogun State House of Assembly had on July 8, 2021, passed the bill.\n\nSpeaker Olakunle Oluomo subsequently transmitted a clean copy to Governor Dapo Abiodun for assent.\n\nThe bill was passed after unanimous votes by the lawmakers at the sitting where the bill was read the third time.",

          "text": "To adequately police and protect a nation\u2019s territorial integrity through the land, air, and sea, efforts must be geared towards procurement of sophisticated armaments for the Armed Forces, as well as invest inadequate training of personnel on new trends in strategy, tact, leadership, fighting skills, and weapon handling. This in addition to building capability in local manufacturing of the needed military hardware and logistics equipment, writes our Defence correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nThough no nation is an island onto itself when it comes to manufacturing of light and lethal military armaments and logistics equipment, but some are more equal than others.\n\nWhile, the United States, Russian China, UK, Israel, France, Iran, North Korea, Japan, India, Brazil, and Pakistan, may be self sufficient in the area of manufacturing of these armaments and logistics equipment, they still depend on each other for certain hardware so as to maintain balance of force.\n\nRegrettably, most nations in Africa have not build the technical capability of becoming self sufficient in weapon manufacturing, and hence depend on other advanced nations for their supplies, even when its territories are battle field for terrorism, insurgency, sea piracy human trafficking amongst several other ills that depend on light and lethal weapons to execute their nefarious mandate.\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces is not insulated from this abnormality in the continent. However, the Armed Forces of Nigeria, especially the Nigerian Navy is making effort to bridge this identified gap.\n\nBut before presenting the graphic details of what the service had done thus far in this regard, it is imperative to also highlight the effort of Federal Government in the area of fleet renewal for the service.\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral AZ Gambo posited that the NN\u2019s ability to effectively deliver improved maritime security for the nation would be greatly enhanced if critical equipment shortfall in the areas of operating platforms and key infrastructure are addressed.\n\nThe CNS who said this while delivering a paper at Bayero University Kano, during the recently concluded Chief of the Naval Staff Annual Conference 2021further averred that the critical platforms including ships and aircraft are crucial for maritime operations.\n\n\u201cNotably, Mr President Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Federal Republic of Nigeria recently granted approval for the NN to acquire 2 x Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs). Furthermore, the NN seeks to strengthen ongoing discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturers to commence local manufacturing/fabrication of spares as a sustainable means of guaranteeing fleet availability and readiness,\u201d Vice Admiral Gambo said.\n\nEnumerating the indigenous ship building effort of the Nigerian Navy, the CNS said: \u201cThe NN Research and Developmental efforts gained traction with local construction and production of equipment that erstwhile are usually vendor-driven and are sourced from manufacturers outside the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with this, the NN initiated an indigenous ship design/building with the construction of Tugboat COMMANDER UGWU and Seaward Defence Boats namely; 31.3m NNS ANDONI and 38m NNS KARADUWA while a third 43m SDB is currently under construction at the Naval Dockyard Limited (NDL).\n\n\u201cThe vessel is programmed to join the Service by the Fourth quarter of this year\u201d.\n\nThe CNS also disclosed that about 170 riverine patrol boats were also built in-country, thus complementing indigenous shipbuilding capacity, employment generation and skills acquisition.\n\nHe noted that these efforts have made the desired positive impacts on the nation\u2019s socio economic development.\n\nThe number one Naval officer said that, \u201crequisite hydrographic capability is one of the key enablers in the attainment of a sustainable blue economy for the nation. The NN intends to develop hydrographic capacity beyond mere surveys to the production of relevant charts to incorporating data relevant to the blue economy and national security. Recently, the NN has upgraded its Hydrography Department to produce navigational and bathymetric charts. This has caused reduction in foreign exchange losses previously deployed to procure these charts.\n\n\u201cProspective hydrographic surveys would be governed by the principle of \u2018one data collection, multiple usage\u2019 to facilitate its use in support of hydro-seismic data, safety of navigation and military applications. Thus, to bolster its hydrographic survey capability, the NN recently acquired a Hydrographic Survey Vessel NNS LANA. Also, arising from the extant Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NN and Nigerian Export and Import Bank, the NN recently took delivery of some hydrographic survey equipment procured by the Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, efforts are ongoing to upgrade the NN Hydrographic Department to a National Hydrographic Agency (NHA) by 2025 to attract independent funding to drive attainment of its future objectives in line with best practices. This development would further boost the maritime trade and shipping activities along the nation\u2019s maritime domain for enhanced national development\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on some of the measures the service put in place to guarantee safe maritime environment, the CNS said: \u201cA commendable stride has also been made by the NN in the enhancement of its surveillance capabilities through a Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) project to enhance our maritime security architecture. The twin but complementary systems of the Regional Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) facility and the FALCON EYE system leverage modern technology to enhance the safeguard of immense hydrocarbon and other mineral resources in the nation\u2019s maritime domain with highly encouraging outputs. The FALCON EYE System incorporates surveillance and intelligence capabilities which allows for real time monitoring of activities in the nation\u2019s maritime environment. This facilitates decision making on shipping activities, maritime safety and violation of maritime laws.\n\n\u201cThe FALCON EYE system played a key role in the rescue of the crew of Chinese FV HAILUFENG II by NN in 2020. In addition, the intelligence generated from the 2 systems led to the arrest of over 30 vessels engaged in IUUF as well as the arrest of over 50 pirates. With these assets, the NN is better positioned to guarantee maritime security which in turn will boost Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas production and other maritime activities that are essential for the sustenance of the nation\u2019s economy\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff nonetheless said that in spite of improved FGN intervention in support of various NN engagements, the current level of statutory funding for the NN is still far below the requirement to sustain a force capable of discharging its roles effectively.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it requires about 800,000 litres of AGO to sail NNS THUNDER for 14-21 days continuous sea patrol. This is without adding costs for other essentials such as water, rations, operational allowances, personal protection equipment, arms and ammunition. The cost of sustaining a ship such as NNS THUNDER and the entire NN Fleet can thus be better imagined. Inadequacy of funds affects ship availability and sustainability for effective maritime response. It is only rational therefore, that the NN considers the option of stakeholder contributions to the logistics cost of sustaining the NN fleet in furtherance of maritime security. Accordingly, NN recently made a presentation at the National Assembly on a bill for an act to establish the Nigerian Maritime Trust Fund for the purpose of training, provision of security equipment and related facilities to enhance the skills of personnel of the NN,\u201d he proposed.\n\nHe further theorized that in the foreseeable future, the maritime domain would continue to provide the mainstay of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cTo enhance NN\u2019s ability to effectively address emerging challenges for improved operational efficiency, the Service is articulating new perspectives taking into cognizance its past experiences, current operational realities and the contemporary strategic security environment,\u201d he conclueded.",

          "title": "Insecurity will persist unless Nigerians are meaningfully engaged \u2013 APC chieftain -NigPilot",
          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has said that the country will continue to be confronted with the security challenges it is currently facing as long as a majority of Nigerians were not properly and meaningfully engaged.\n\nLukman, who noted that security agencies in the country were already overstretched stressed that governments at various levels must find a way of making positive use of the abundant human resources because the over-reliance on oil revenue will not solve the problems.\n\nThe PGF DG said contrary to insinuations that the spate of insecurity appears to have worsened since the APC administration came to power in 2015, the insurgency was not the only problem troubling the country pre-2015, stressing that there were cases of cattle rustling in the entire North as far back as 2013 as well as kidnapping in the Southern parts of the country.\n\nLukman also took time to explain some of the measures he thinks should be implemented to make the APC to function more effectively as a real progressive political party.\n\n\u201cI believe as a party, immediately after the Convention, the first thing the new leadership should do is to have a membership data that is computerized. We can\u2019t continue to have a situation where our membership data is not electronically preserved.

Lukman has said that the country will continue to be confronted with the security challenges it is currently facing as long as a majority of Nigerians were not properly and meaningfully engaged.\n\nLukman, who noted that security agencies in the country were already overstretched stressed that governments at various levels must find a way of making positive use of the abundant human resources because the over-reliance on oil revenue will not solve the problems.\n\nThe PGF DG said contrary to insinuations that the spate of insecurity appears to have worsened since the APC administration came to power in 2015, the insurgency was not the only problem troubling the country pre-2015, stressing that there were cases of cattle rustling in the entire North as far back as 2013 as well as kidnapping in the Southern parts of the country.\n\nLukman also took time to explain some of the measures he thinks should be implemented to make the APC to function more effectively as a real progressive political party.\n\n\u201cI believe as a party, immediately after the Convention, the first thing the new leadership should do is to have a membership data that is computerized.

Unfortunately, two (2) police personnel and a civilian sustained gunshot injuries while a patrol vehicle went in flames and the Police Station was partly torched.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, a joint team of Police and Military personnel immediately trailed the fleeing attackers and intercepted them along OKo Ajali road before the attackers escaped with gunshot injuries. \u201cThe operatives recovered a highlander jeep and two motorcycles\u201d.\n\nAnother incident also occurred along the Nnobi-Nnewi road of the state where some hoodlums reportedly shot a vehicle driver and abducted other occupants of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cInvestigations into the incidents are ongoing while efforts are being intensified to identify and rescue the occupants of the vehicle,\u201d DSP Tochukwu said.\n\nWhile condemning the unfortunate incidents, the CP called on citizens in the state to be calm, patriotic and go about their lawful businesses as the police, the military and other security agencies are already rejigging strategies to contain the situation and prevent any further threats to lives and property in the State.\n\nHe vowed that the perpetrators of these dastardly acts will not go unpunished.\n\nRead Also: Obiano Places N20m Bounty On Killers Of Dora Akunyili\u2019s Husband, Others\n\nThe attack comes just days after the murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, the husband of the late former Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dora Akunyili, and others in the state.\n\nDr. Chike Akunyili was killed by the gunmen on Tuesday alongside his driver and a police escort around the Nkpor junction in Idemili North, Anambra State.\n\nA family source confirmed the news to Channels Television on Wednesday.\n\nHe was said to have been returning from an event where he received a posthumous award of excellence for his late wife when he ran into the hoodlums at Nkpor and was murdered in cold blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Willie Obiano has placed a \u20a620 million bounty on the perpetrators of the gruesome killing.\n\nThe Governor said that the sum will be awarded to anyone who is able to provide useful information to track the killers.\n\nHe said this in a special broadcast after an emergency State Security Council meeting at the Governor\u2019s lodge in Amawbia on Wednesday, while condoling with the Akunyili family, as well as families of others who were killed in the attack.\n\nGovernor Obiano condemned the attack, calling on residents to join forces with security agencies to confront the common enemy and protect the state.\n\nSpeaking further, he lamented that between Sunday, September 26 to date, over 10 persons have been killed in various areas of the state.",

The Commission updated its website with a dedicated FOI section and trained all staff. Since mid-2017 to date, the Commission has proactively published information of its budgets and financial performance, companies listed under the NIPC Act, procurement, court cases, etc.\n\nThe Commission also proactively published information on pioneer status applications processed.

I signed a publicity contract with the M.D today. Many families in Nigeria will not wear the same colour of Aso ebi this December\u201d.\n\nThe retired Medical Doctor traveled all the way from Northern Ireland after reading about Nigeria\u2019s high prevalence of paternity fraud and decided to come and plant in Lekki with his life savings. Nigerian billionaires have no idea how to profit from the country\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nHours after he made the tweet, Penking alleged he has received threats from people asking him to stop talking about the new DNA laboratory.\n\nIn his words; \u201dCan you even believe that I\u2019ve received life threats to stop talking about the new DNA Paternity test laboratory launching in Lekki at 75% discount? Paternity fraud in Nigeria is deeper than you can ever imagine. I myself knew it was bad but I didn\u2019t know it was this bad? My God!\n\nEven if this is the last tweet I will ever make about this, Dear Nigerian men, you owe yourselves the duty to find out whether that child under your care is really your blood. Even if you can\u2019t afford for all, do it for your first child at least . You owe yourself this.\n\nDon\u2019t allow anybody to guilt-trip you that it\u2019s lack of trust. It\u2019s not lack of trust. It is called \u201cbeing double sure\u201d. Many men trusted their partners 100% but found out by accident when they were trying to process foreign citizenship for their children.\n\nPlease save yourself such embarrassment and unnecessary waste of funds. Confirm early. Every child should be taken care of by his father or if taken care of by another man, with his consent.\n\nJudging from where we are in Nigeria, As a man living in Nigeria, I think it is safe to say that your first child is not yours until proven otherwise. You owe yourself and your lineage the proof.\u201d",

          "text": "A Paris court has handed former French President Nicolas Sarkozy a one-year prison sentence after finding him guilty of illegal campaign financing of his failed 2012 re-election bid.\n\nSarkozy, 66, is unlikely to go to jail despite Thursday\u2019s ruling.\n\nHe is expected to appeal the sentence, a move that will in effect suspend it.\n\nThe judge said he could serve the sentence at home with an electronic tag.\n\nSarkozy, France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, was accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($26m) on a re-election bid that he lost to the Socialist Party\u2019s Francois Hollande.\n\nSome of the sum was allegedly used to fund extravagant campaign rallies and then hire public relations agency Bygmalion to mask the real cost of the events.\n\nAt Sarkozy\u2019s five-week trial in May and June, the prosecution portrayed him as having a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the public money available to candidates during campaigning, saying he ignored warnings from his accountants about the ballooning costs.\n\nThe court\u2019s judge had concluded it was \u201cclear that Sarkozy must have known that his campaign team were spending over the legal limit\u201d.\n\nThe verdict was harsher than expected, she said, adding that with the latest conviction, Sarkozy\u2019s political career was definitively \u201cover\u201d.\n\n\u201cProsecutors had asked for a year-long sentence but with six months suspended,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of the symbolism, it won\u2019t be lost on the public that this verdict sends out a message to political candidates and parties that they cannot just act with impunity,\u201d she said.\n\nFrance is heading into a presidential election next year.\n\nThe ruling came after Sarkozy was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He was given a year in prison, and a two-year suspended prison sentence in that case, but is free pending an appeal.\n\nSarkozy, who was not present in court on Thursday, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in both cases.\n\nHe told the court in June that he had not been involved in the logistics of his campaign, nor aware of how money was spent during the election run-up.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine me going into a meeting to discuss the cost of flags?\u201d he said, before claiming he had \u201ctoo much to do\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I was told things were in order, I had no reason to give it more thought.\u201d\n\nBut the court ultimately decided Sarkozy was made aware of the overspending, that he did not act on it and that it was not necessary for him to approve each individual expenditure to be responsible.",

          "title": "Trump\u2019s Taliban Deal Hastened Afghan Collapse, Defence Officials Say",
          "text": "Top US defence officials have said the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan can be traced back to a deal between the group and the Trump administration.\n\nThe so-called Doha agreement was signed in February 2020 and set a date for the US to withdraw its troops.\n\nGen Frank McKenzie said the deal had a \u201creally pernicious effect\u201d on the Afghan government and military.\n\nDefence Secretary Lloyd Austin agreed, saying the agreement had helped the Taliban get \u201cstronger\u201d.\n\nIn addition to setting a withdrawal date, the Doha agreement included broad obligations on the Taliban to take steps to prevent groups such as al-Qaeda from threatening the security of the US and its allies.\n\nAfter his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August, instead of May.\n\nThe US defence officials made the comments on Wednesday in testimony to the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe hearing is taking place weeks after a chaotic withdrawal at Kabul airport as foreign powers sought to get their citizens home and thousands of desperate Afghans begged for rescue. A suicide attack killed 182 people during the operation.\n\nAs head of the US Central Command, Gen McKenzie oversaw the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which marked the end of a 20-year presence in the country and America\u2019s longest war.\n\nGen McKenzie told the committee the Doha agreement had a strong psychological effect on the Afghan government because it set a date for \u201cwhen they could expect all assistance to end\u201d.\n\nHe said he had believed \u201cfor quite a while\u201d that if the US reduced the number of its military advisers in Afghanistan below 2,500, the Afghan government and military would inevitably collapse.\n\nAfter the Doha agreement, he said the troop reduction ordered by President Biden in April was \u201cthe other nail in the coffin\u201d.\n\nMr Austin said that by committing the US to ending air strikes against the Taliban, the Doha agreement meant the Islamist group \u201cgot stronger, they increased their offensive operations against Afghan security forces, and the Afghans were losing a lot of people on a weekly basis\u201d.\n\nThe defence officials previously spoke to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, where Gen Milley and Gen McKenzie said they had recommended keeping a force of 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, ahead of the full US withdrawal in August.\n\nGen Milley also said the Taliban takeover would make it harder to protect Americans from terrorist attacks, as he described the group as a terrorist organisation that \u201cstill has not broken ties with al-Qaeda\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the militants had \u201cgiven guarantees to the world that there will not be any threat against any country including the United States from Afghan soil\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to the agreement which has been signed in Doha between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States. We also want Americans and its allies to be committed on the agreement too. Instead of making negative comments it would be better for them to choose the way of diplomacy and co-operation,\u201d he said.",
