          "text": "A group, Rescue Nigerian Youth Solomon Dalung Foundation, has called on Nigerians to reject old politicians who have run out of solutions to the challenges facing the country.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the foundation, Navy Stephen, according to a statement on Wednesday, made this call during the inauguration of its South-West zone and executives in Lagos.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am queuing behind our aspirant, Prince Adewole Adebayo because the politicians we have are getting older and they are not getting it right again. We need bright and visionary leaders who can rescue the country from its current economic and security quagmires so we can move forward like other nations.\n\n\u201cIt is glaring that Nigerian politicians are not making Nigerian youth productive \u2013 they only use them during the political process for their selfish end. That is not good for a country like ours. We need young, enterprising and visionary political leaders to take us out of doldrums.\u201d\n\nThe women leader of the Foundation, Apostle Temitope Adebisi, lamented the state of the country, adding that the government has failed the people.\n\n\u201cFor how long are we going to continue in this situation in the country where old politicians do not see anything wrong in the educational system that is getting rottened? Yet, they send their children to other African and Western countries. Nigeria current politicians are mortgaging the future of youths; they are not bothered at all.\n\n\u201cWe are not in politics to collect money; we want a change, we want a better life for us and our youth. We are bothered by what our youths are gradually becoming nowadays because of socio-economic challenges and frustration they grapple with. It is not good for a progressive society. Once the future of our children is destroyed, we do not have anything we are living for any longer. Government has failed us,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) yesterday, said that the nation\u2019s economy grew by 3.98 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 even as it recorded an annual growth rate of 3.40 per in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen on the fourth quarter of Gross Domestic Products (GDP), in Abuja, the Statistician-General (SG) of the Federation, Dr Simon Harry, said that in nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that the economy has maintained this positive trajectory up to the 4th quarter of 2021, recording a GDP growth rate of 3.98 per cent. This figure to an average Nigerian may be seen as lower than the 4.03 per cent growth rate recorded in Q3, 2021. However, analytically, it is not when viewed in terms of the base effect of the corresponding period in Q4 of 2020 when the economy recorded a GDP growth rate of 0.11 per cent as against the growth rate recorded in Q3 of the same year which was -3.62 per cent.\n\n\u201cI must state that the improvement being seen in the output growth in the last five quarters depicts steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy. Globally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic. Thus, economic recovery is a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors: households, non-profit institutions serving households, financial corporations, non-financial corporations and the government.\n\n\u201cHowever, in Nigeria, the prospects of consolidating the recovery is glaring considering the improved economic performance over these periods of time. It is important to also mention that annual GDP growth of 2021 stands at 3.40 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nThis performance, the SG, further explained, is higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 which recorded N43.56 trillion, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent. Nominal Gross Domestic Product in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion. The annual nominal value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as against N152.32 trillion in 2020, showing a growth rate of 13.92 per cent. In terms of real GDP which shows the volume of economic activities, fourth-quarter 2021 recorded N20.33 trillion, higher by N778.91 billion than N19.55 trillion recorded in fourth quarter 2020.\n\n\u201cThis shows output growth of 3.98 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021. Moreover, the output of the fourth quarter of 2021 was higher by N1.79 trillion compared to the third quarter of 2021 when aggregate real GDP was N18.54 trillion. The annual real value of 2021 stood at N72.39 trillion compared to N70.01 trillion in 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nSG recalled that the Nigerian economy exited the COVID-19- induced recession in Q4, 2020 with a marginal GDP growth rate of 0.11 per cent. Since then, he added, the economy has witnessed four consecutive quarters of positive growth as follows: 0.11 per cent in Q4 2020, 0.51 per cent in Q1 2021, 5.01 per cent in Q2 2021 and 4. 03 per cent in Q3 2021.\n\nAccording to Harry, in terms of oil performance, the average daily oil production of 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThis, he said, shows a lower volume compared to 1.56mbpd recorded in Q4 2020 by 0.06mbpd.\n\n\u201cFourth quarter 2021 daily oil production also shows lower volume compared to the third quarter 2021 production volume of 1.57mbpd. This trend accounts for an oil growth rate of -8.06 per cent in real terms recorded in fourth-quarter 2021 and an annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2021, oil contributed 5.19 per cent to Gross Domestic Product from 5.87 per cent contributed in the fourth quarter of 2020.

          "title": "How can startups succeed in their sectors?",
          "text": "In 2015, only 55 African startups were able to secure investments. At the time, current unicorns like Flutterwave and Wave were still in their early-stage, and Africa\u2019s venture capital boom had not begun.\n\nBy 2020, the number of African startups that had secured funding had increased, by 552.73%, to 359 startups. 2021 saw startups raise over $4 billion from 355 funding rounds from investors like LoftyInc, Y Combinator, Partech and Novatech. The reason for the investor boom is largely due to the opportunities for growth in Africa\u2019s tech sector. There are huge swathes of underdevelopment in infrastructure, logistics, remittance, and energy begging for startup intervention. The internet penetration rate in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), for example, is still at 29% while only 46.7% of persons living in SSA have access to on-grid electricity.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that startups are continuously popping up with ideas on how to solve the continent\u2019s problems. Unfortunately, very few of these startups actually succeed or excel in their operations. According to a 2019 World Economic Forum (WEF) report, only 8% of African startups make it to the Series B stage of funding. Across the continent, startup failure rates range from 61% in Nigeria, 75% in Ethiopia, and 74% in Ghana, to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya. Funding plays a large role in this gap and a number of startups are unable to secure funding due to a lack of operational excellence\u2014a mindset of the workplace where problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership results in continuous improvement in an organisation.\n\nTo examine how startups can achieve operational excellence and attract more funding in the process, TechCabal spoke with Femi Adeyemo, founder and CEO of Arnergy.\n\nBuilding from Ground Up with Femi Adeyemo\n\nArnergy is a solar energy company in Nigeria that\u2019s providing energy solutions to multinational clients\u2014including Heineken, KPMG, Shell, Citibank, 54Gene, Ardova, and the Dangote Group. In the third episode of Season 2 of Building from Ground Up, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, sits with Femi Adeyemo to discuss Arnergy\u2019s past and how startups can emulate its success through operational excellence.\n\nLeading by example\n\nThe most important thing Adeyemo thinks founders can do to help build and sustain a culture of operational excellence in their startups is leading by example. This sometimes involves doing things that may not necessarily scale, especially when starting out.\n\n\u201cAt Arnergy\u2019s inception, I was one of the engineers installing solar panels,\u201d he says, \u201cIt was something I knew would not continue, especially if we grew, but I still did it because I had to lead my team. Early-stage employees saw how I worked, and how I excelled.\u201d\n\nWhile such hands-on learning or teaching may not be feasible as startups grow and expand, it helps build foundational team members who can then carry on the same practice with their teammates.\n\nWalk the talk\n\nImage source: TechCabal\n\nIf you\u2019re leading your team by example, you should also endeavour to lead your customers by using your products: Walk the talk!\n\nAccording to Adeyemo, all major Arnergy offices and sites\u2014including his own home\u2014are fitted with Arnergy products. \u201cI run a solar energy company. It won\u2019t be a good look if customers come to my office and see us running generators. We have to walk the talk and use our products, so prospective customers can see that we trust ourselves.\u201d\n\nAdeyemo also points out that walking the talk helps in product management as well as sales and marketing. \u201cIn using your product, you learn how to design it better; you learn its flaws and what improvements can be made. You\u2019re also able to quickly diagnose problems that customers have.\u201d\n\nKPIs v OKRs\n\nThe founder points out the importance of distinguishing between Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).\n\n\u201cOrganisations cannot achieve operational excellence by sticking to what we know as KPIs, which is what is set at the beginning of the year and then measured at the end,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to have consistent feedback and 360\u00b0 reviews. This is where OKRs come in. Objectives and Key Results are a more reliable way to boost operational excellence, and feedback helps you iterate your OKRs.\u201d\n\nUnlike KPIs, OKRs provide for aggressive goals and, more importantly, the measurable steps that can be taken to achieve those goals. OKRs are a strategic framework whereas KPIs are measurements that exist within a framework.\n\nAdeyemo also explains the importance of standardisation and how it\u2019s critical to helping startups scale properly. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the lessons we\u2019ve learnt on the way to becoming a major player in the energy sector. When Arnergy started in 2013, investors weren\u2019t too crazy about energy. Everyone was rushing into fintech, and so we did a lot of bootstrapping. But standardisation helped us build along the way, and it\u2019s what helped us scale effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also no perfect product\u201d\n\nAdeyemo points out that startups and entrepreneurs need to learn to build first, then iterate as they go on. \u201cAnd it all ties into my point about consistent feedback. Feedback will help you iterate. When Samsung launched the first tablet, it was not perfect; it was buggy overheated quickly. But if they hadn\u2019t released it, they might be where Nokia is today, which is nowhere. Now, Samsung has sleeker tablets, and that\u2019s because they keep iterating.\u201d\n\nAnother lesson is offering products at prices your target customers can afford. \u201cIt was easy to say that our target market is 80 million Nigerians who don\u2019t have consistent access to electricity, but how many of them are willing and able to pay for our products? So, the ability to create products within the income reach of your customers is something that will help you scale.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Adeyemo reiterates that operational excellence is a top-down approach. \u201cLine managers and founders are subject to it too. Founders should also check in to make sure that it\u2019s what is being reported that is being done. It doesn\u2019t mean that leaders should micromanage\u2014you should trust your people\u2014but when it\u2019s necessary, check in on people and validate the data reported.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

Crucially, this applies not only to people playing games, but also those willing to pay as well,\u201d said Carry1st CEO and Co-founder, Cordel Robbin-Coker.\n\nCrypto adoption and gaming in Africa\n\nAlready, 63 million of the 186 million gamers, pay for games with these African figures projected to be the fastest-growing in the world as the continent also begins adoption of digital currencies.\n\nAnother research by Newswagg\u2019s points to a growing appetite for trading in gaming assets using digital currencies with 38 percent of 41.9 million gamers owning crypto across the world being millennials aged 21-38 years old.\n\nAfrica and the Middle East have a combined 5.9 million gamers owning Crypto, with a potential to shore up these numbers in Africa given that the continent will have one of the largest youthful populations by 2050.\n\nAccording to Newswagg\u2019s, 80 percent gamers with crypto accounts are interested in using digital currency for gaming purchases, with 67 percent yearning for an opportunity to use cryptocurrency in gaming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an immense potential for crypto to be more involved in the gaming industry,\u201d says the report.\n\nGlobal crypto gaming was valued at 321 million US dollars in 2020.\n\nNigeria has leaped ahead of its African peers in adoption of cryptocurrencies following the launch of Africa\u2019s first Central Bank-backed digital currency- the e-Naira in 2021.\n\nWhile Kenya is yet to launch its own regulated digital currency, it tops the world in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trade.\n\nSouth Africa is currently in the piloting stage of its project, Dunbar- that will support cross border payments with Mauritius getting closer to piloting now in the development stage.\n\nSix other African countries including Tunisia, Ghana and Morocco are still conducting research on regulated digital currencies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Most government-run university students have lost blocks of time due to strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Under President Buhari\u2019s administration, students have lost 13 months to strikes.\n\nThere seems to be no respite in sight, and this week, the body declared a \u201ccomprehensive and total\u201d four-week strike. In a separate development, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, is embroiled in a dispute with ASUU over its decision to make Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Communication, Isa Pantami, a professor.\n\nWhile we hope that the strike ends quickly, we encourage students to use any opportunity to gain relevant skills while waiting for the strike to be called off. While you\u2019re here, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could take a minute to share this newsletter with at least three people on your contact list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The newsletter edition dated February 15, 2022, erroneously reported that the European Union plans to invest $927 billion under its global gateway initiative. The correct figure is $927 million.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest:\n\nLocal competition for Uber\n\nWasla\u2019s $9 million raise\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nLocal competition for Uber?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos is famous for many things. From its entrepreneurial spirit to dare-devil danfo drivers who will test your patience. But perhaps, its most notable feature is its traffic.\n\nWhile the British use the weather as a conversation starter, Nigerians use Lagos traffic to start conversations.\n\nLike any problem, the traffic situation has led various entrepreneurs to build solutions with local startups like Treepz, Touch and Pay, and Shuttlers joining foreign brands like Uber and Bolt to provide convenient transportation solutions.\n\nOne local player is Transtura, a mobility startup founded by Vincent Adeoba that provides a convenient mode of transportation using shuttle minibuses. What began from renting out his car to be used on Uber has grown into a startup serving 2,500 users. However, the company has not stopped there, recently acquiring W\u00e0z\u00f3 as it plans to roll out payment solutions.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo had a chat with the founders a few weeks ago, where they shared insights from their journey and plans for the future. You can read more about that here: Transtura\u2019s journey to digital payments; from launch to acquisition\n\nWasla bags $9 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Egyptian eCommerce companies burst onto the scene bagging huge investment rounds aided by rising Internet penetration rates and digitally savvy millennials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWasla is one of such startups, founded in 2018 by Serag Meneassy, Taymour Sabry, and Mahmoud El-Said. The startup has announced an investment of $9 million from Contact Financial Holding, a financial services provider in Egypt.\n\nThe startup offers its users a wide array of services enabling them to save while shopping. These services include a deal finder and cashback points that can be used for airtime and gift cards. Following the fresh injection of capital, the startup plans to introduce buy now, pay later options and a new online payment option for its users.\n\nWith 1.5 million downloads, Wasla is eyeing regional expansion with plans to expand to Nigeria. Speaking to TechCrunch, CEO El-Said said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market at the end of the day, you have roughly 250 million people. They\u2019re very technologically advanced, and their adoption of eCommerce is quite good.\u201d\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting payments is a significant challenge for businesses across the globe. With several payment providers, it is often difficult to harmonise a business\u2019 payment stack. In Europe and America, payment orchestration platforms have been built, providing a faster way for businesses to receive payments and easing the expansion process.\n\nMoneyHash, an Egyptian startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose after launching in 2021. The startup, which claims to be the first payment orchestration and revenue operations platform in the Middle East/Africa, raised its pre-seed round from investors including Nuwa Capital, First Check Africa, VentureSouq, VentureFriends, and angel investors like NerdWallet Co-founders, Tim Chen and Jake Gibson and Belvo Co-founder, Oriol Tintore.\n\nFounded by Nadir Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash is currently testing its product with 17 companies, five of which are active and paying companies. It charges these companies between $150 and $1,000 with transaction fees starting from 10 cents and reducing as payment volume increases.\n\nCurrently operating in Egypt, the company intends to use its pre-seed funding to drive growth across the Middle East and Africa as it aims to become the AWS of payments in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWhat AWS did to the cloud, where it made it easy for companies to build as many services on top of the infrastructure, we think the payment industry, especially in emerging markets, is very fragmented and needs an AWS for money, which MoneyHash is doing when you connect with it and build as much as you need without needing to change anything,\u201d CEO Abdelrazik said in a chat with TechCrunch.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nCrime and NFTs: Chainalysis Detects Significant Wash Trading and Some Money Laundering In this Emerging Asset Class\n\nNigeria\u2019s sleepless students trying to beat the Lagos traffic\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a productive day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "The national policy draft on incentivising the healthcare industry is built on four pillars of fostering an enabling environment to attract private capital, driving public-private partnerships, government funding, and technology adoption.\n\nBut key sector stakeholders think the policy should not overlook other pertinent issues like incentives for players and the impact that uncritical taxes on imported medical products leave on the final cost of care.\n\nPamela Ajayi, president, the Healthcare Federation of Nigeria (HFN), identifies custom duty challenges faced by importers of medical consumables due to inaccurate product classification as a burden that inflates the cost of medical equipment and treatment prices.\n\nThe policy, unfortunately, fails to present actionable plans on how the government aims to reduce out-of-pocket expenses borne by individual patients who contribute 77 percent of private spending on healthcare in Nigeria, she says.\n\nData from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation show there is a disproportionately low contribution of public funding to the total health expenditure as insurance penetrations drag and leave individuals with the largest burden.\n\n\u201cSome of the solutions that could be proffered to reverse the brain drain challenge among us includes private sector incentives and training,\u201d Ajayi notes during a meeting with the Federal Government to lay bare the struggles of private sector players.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of issues. Some border on policy and bills needed to be passed, while others border on financials. For example, some of the incentives that our members feel are required in the healthcare sector. We also have some issues in terms of regulation, taxation, and other challenges that our people are experiencing,\u201d she states.\n\nCurrent incentives in the sector from the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) basically cover income tax relief, import duty concession, rural investment allowance, investment tax relief, exemption from value-added tax, and replacement of obsolete plants and pieces of machinery, Emeka Offor, chief executive of the commission, states.\n\nCompanies are granted tax relief for up to three years, which can be extended for over a year or two, but they have to be involved either in the manufacturing of drugs, pharmaceutical chemicals, or the production of dental equipment and supplies. Importation of medical equipment classified as lifesaving gets import duty concession while companies providing medical services listed as a qualifying activity for VAT exemption also get relieves.\n\nAkin Abayomi, commission for health, Lagos State, in a presentation took a contrary stance, saying there should be an increased focus on stimulating the economy instead of offering tax breaks, saying Nigeria does not collect enough taxes to deploy breaks.\n\nRead also: CBN, banks in race to meeting rising demand for healthcare\n\nCBN, banks race to meet rising demand for healthcare\n\nBut Ajayi states that there are pressing problems. There is currently no provision in the industry for players to access foreign exchange at the official rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe policy omits the manpower needs of the industry, does not cover the engagement of expatriate staff and knowledge transfer to indigenous experts, nor does it have special plans to incentivise returning specialists in the diaspora.\n\nAjayi in her presentation explains that the response to healthcare problems also has to be holistic enough to develop a robust plan on the protection of intellectual property to ease attraction of funds and boost innovation in the healthcare industry.\n\nShe further notes that the gaps in the country\u2019s healthcare delivery system require public-private partnership. It requires effective enforcement of the policy, monitoring, sanctions for defaulters, and adequate compensation for those who follow through.\n\nMeanwhile, Ibrahim Yahaya, minister of state for health, speaking on the issue of incentives for healthcare workers as a measure to stem brain drain, says the country needs to have a new conversation to determine how to compensate workers, saying the current template of salary structure cannot allow competition with rates in other countries.\n\n\u201cAs legislators, we have tried to ensure the hazard allowance is increased and we have ensured it is in the budget. The training allowance for resident doctors is also being implemented. Overall, we need to agree as a nation that this category of workers is a priority and should be paid separately,\u201d he states.",

          "text": "The nine-year tussle between Geometric Power and Interstate Electric that hindered Aba, the commercial hub of Eastern Nigeria, from enjoying a 24-hour power supply has been laid to rest as Geometric Power paid $26 million re-acquisition value of the Aba ring-fenced area, yesterday.\n\nThe asset was handed over by the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) through the Bureau for Public Enterprises (BPE) at a brief event in Abuja.\n\nThis latest development has been seen as a great achievement for Nigeria\u2019s power sector and would ensure a more efficient electricity supply to Aba city and its environment.\n\nThe $500 million Geometric/Aba power plant has the capacity to produce and distribute about 141 megawatts (mw) of electricity in its first phase, with new distribution lines, four new sub-stations and three rehabilitated sub-stations.\n\nThe protracted tussle between Geometric Power and Interstate Electric Company, owner of the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), over ownership of the asset and related issues have posed a serious challenge for successive administrations since 2005.\n\nBarth Nnaji, chairman/founder, Geometric Power Limited, said the Aba ring-fenced project would really bring a new model of how to deliver electricity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are very delighted that today has come that we have gotten Aba ring-fenced and we are ready to give reliable electricity to the people of Aba,\u201d an elated Nnaji, who is also Nigeria\u2019s former minister of power, told BusinessDay after the handover.\n\nExplaining the long tussle, Nnaji said, \u201c The issue was just simple: the former government sold what was rightfully ours to the people who acquired EEDC.\n\n\u201cSo, they simply bundled the Aba ringed-fence as part of EEDC and gave it to them. But when they were doing it, they did it knowingly.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we went to court and that is why all the processes, and we are very grateful that this government has mediated and resolved the issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nnaji, his company is also quite grateful that those involved in the acquisition, EEDC, along with Afrinvest saw reason to resolve the matter; \u201cwe have settled, and we have paid; we have now paid the acquisition price, which is $26 million.\u201d\n\nAfreximbank, the key lender, will bring on close to $50 million of which $26 million has been used to reacquire the asset, while the balance is to basically complete infrastructure and ensure it can deliver the much needed power the area requires in boosting industrialisation and export capacity.\n\nSpeaking on the new strategic plans for the Aba asset, Nnaji maintained that first of all, anybody acquiring a power distribution company (Disco) should have the financial and technical capacity, and that is what we did in Aba.\n\n\u201cWe have actually made the necessary investments to ensure there are no issues in terms of reliability for electricity supply. We have embedded generation and distribution, which ensures a reliable supply of electricity.\n\n\u201cWe have invested about eight times the amount of the acquisition in Aba already. We built new substations, new power lines, in fact over 140km of new lines. We built four brand new substations. When we came in, there were only three substations \u2013 2 by 15MPH each, so we built exactly the same size of four brand new ones.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve built gas pipelines \u2013 27km \u2013 to ensure that we have our gas uninterrupted from Shell to us, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe huge investment so far is to ensure that the network works effectively and to position the Aba ring-fenced area to set the pace in electricity generation and distribution, he stated.\n\nIn addition to the power plants, we have built an embedded Power Plant 141 megawatts, which if you look at the amount of power that goes into Enugu Disco, is about half of the total power going into it right now, he said.\n\n\u201cSo, that is how much power we have built just for Aba alone. That is what it takes to have reliable electricity. So, that is the plan,\u201d he said.\n\nTo avoid estimated billing, he disclosed plans to invest heavily in pre-paid metering, saying, \u201cThis is to ensure that all the consumers in Aba are metered in the next two to three years.\u201d\n\nAlex Okoh, director-general, BPE, said the handover represented another notable success in the government\u2019s sectoral and enterprise reform programme.\n\nExplaining the resolution process, Okoh said the bureau initiated a series of engagements with various stakeholders, which led to one, the signing of the term sheet between Geometric Power and Interstate Electric Limited, the core investor in EEDC.\n\nAnother initiative taken by the BPE was to sign an agreement between the Federal Government, Geometric Power and Interstate Electric on the principles that will guide the resolution of the licensing overlap between EEDC and Geometric Power as well as the sale and transfer of the asset by the EEDC to Geometric Power, he said.\n\n\u201cFollowing the approval of the transaction by the NCP, BPE on behalf of the Federal Government, Interstate Electric Limited executed an asset transfer agreement through which both parties transferred their respective interest in the Aba ring-fence area to Geometric Power.\n\nRead also: Geometric to power Aba as BPE hands over today\n\n\u201cAlthough the transaction will generate some revenue for the government and Interstate Electric, the most important gain is \u201cthat the Federal Government was handing over this asset to a very tenacious investor who has made a firm commitment to transform the Aba ring-fence area into a model electric supply franchise, providing quality, stable and appropriately priced electricity to consumers, thereby unlocking the significant economic benefits of this commercial and industrial hub of the regional and national economy,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Okoh acknowledged a number of challenges facing the electricity sector, he assured of the government commitment to resolve the issues and create an enabling environment that will attract and incentivise private sector capital into the sector.\n\nKester Enwereonu, director, EEDC, who represented Interstate Power, acknowledged that the handover marked the end to the ownership tussle of the Aba ring-fenced, which he said actually began right from the time the acquisition process was concluded.\n\nFor Peter Olowononi, head of client relations for West Africa, Afreximbank, the handover was symbolic, in terms of helping the bank achieve a key objective of catalysing industrialisation, not only in Nigeria, but on the continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, the Geometric ring-fenced area signifies real potential for the Aba, which has shown very strong characteristics of industrialisation in terms of the manufacturing capacity of Eastern Nigeria, as Afreximbank, industrialisation and export manufacturing are one of our cardinal strategic pillars.\n\n\u201cAnd so by coming into this transaction and helping Geometric to reacquire the Aba ring-fenced area is very symbolic in helping them put the power infrastructure which they have built to use, and ensuring that these manufacturing capacities can be brought to life as soon as possible,\u201d Olowononi said.",

          "title": "How Instagram\u2019s \u2018Billionaire Gucci Master\u2019 Sank Abba Kyari, the Super Cop",
          "text": "Instagram isn\u2019t exactly known for its fidelity to reality. It\u2019s a place people go to curate an image of their best self, or their aspirational one. But rarely do those images obscure a darker truth to the extent they did back in 2019, in a pair of posts by two public figures from Nigeria.\n\nOn Dec. 8, Ramon Abbas, better known as @hushpuppi, Ray Hushpuppi, or the Billionaire Gucci Master, posted a photo of himself lounging on the hood of his purple Rolls-Royce. His outfit, designed by the legendary Virgil Abloh, was a sky blue shirt-and-pants set with a white cloud that appeared to float across his forearms and midriff.\n\nHe\u2019d parked the Rolls in the driveway of the Palazzo Versace Dubai, a resort-style hotel where he lived in a penthouse apartment.\n\nFor Abbas, then a 37-year-old influencer who\u2019d gone from a childhood in a poor part of Lagos to an adulthood full of private jets and celebrity friends, this sort of extremely conspicuous consumption was his brand. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in competition,\u201d read the post\u2019s caption.\n\nThat same week, 3,000 miles away, Nigeria Police Force Deputy Commissioner Abba Kyari, also known as @abbakyari75, struck a different pose. Kyari\u2019s style was all business: seated at a desk stacked with files, wearing a blue dashiki and his ever-present AirPods.\n\nFlanked by two plainclothes deputies, he looked purposefully into the camera. His caption was equally dry: \u201cWith my Senior Colleagues today.\u201d\n\nLining the walls behind him were shelves laden with dozens of his awards. In a decade-long string of busts, Kyari, then 44, had captured kidnappers, freed school children, and hunted assassins.\n\n\u201cHe was the star,\u201d says Rommy Mom, who sits on Nigeria\u2019s Police Service Commission, an independent body responsible for police oversight. During a year\u2019s long wave of violent crime and terrorism, the Nigerian press had nicknamed Kyari, the chief of the country\u2019s Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the Super Cop.\n\nKyari\u2019s glowing press ran counter to law enforcement\u2019s checkered reputation in Nigeria. In particular, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS\u2014which Kyari had previously headed for six years in Lagos\u2014was known for a mix of savage brutality and day-to-day corruption.\n\nA year later, in 2020, SARS\u2019s tactics would be the subject of large street protests that culminated in the government agreeing to disband it. Even then, Kyari somehow seemed to float above it all.\n\n\u201cHere was someone who was viewed as really uncharacteristically competent at their job in an organization not known for competence,\u201d says Matthew Page, who researches Nigerian corruption as an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London think tank.\n\n\u201cThat was the narrative around him\u2014that he was actually getting the job done rather than being abusive or on the take.\u201d\n\nThe Billionaire Gucci Master and the Super Cop could hardly have seemed more different. Hushpuppi had more than 2 million Instagram followers to Kyari\u2019s 80,000, and he\u2019d have looked about as at home in an office surrounded by paperwork as Super Cop would have on the hood of a purple Rolls.\n\nYet behind each man\u2019s carefully sculpted public image, their fates appear to have been deeply intertwined.\n\nOff-camera, Abbas fueled his lifestyle with a different kind of hustle, as an online scammer and money launderer. He was a partner in what is called business email compromise scams, in which hackers penetrate corporate accounts and collect on phony invoices.\n\nHe moved money for scams that targeted a law firm in New York, a bank in Malta, and a Premier League soccer club. He teamed up with a loose network of hackers and fraudsters\u2014including, at least once, a state-sponsored group from North Korea\u2014in schemes chasing as much as $100 million.\n\nEventually, he landed in the crosshairs of the FBI. In June 2020, local police raided his Dubai penthouse and shipped him to the U.S., where last summer he pleaded guilty to money laundering related to scams that brought in close to $24 million. This July, he\u2019ll face a sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nThe announcement of Abbas\u2019s plea contained a more explosive revelation, however. The U.S. government alleged that one of the influencer\u2019s fellow conspirators was a man sworn to uphold the law: Abba Kyari.\n\nAbba Kyari was born in Gombe, a town in northeastern Nigeria. His dad, a teacher, raised 30 children in a polygamous family, and Kyari was the eldest.\n\n\u201cI handled so many cases whenever my siblings had any problems with one another,\u201d he later said in one Instagram post. \u201cI started my detective work in my house.\u201d After earning a university degree, he graduated from the police academy in 2002 and in eight years rose from street officer to commander of a SARS unit in Lagos.\n\nHe earned a reputation for risky and aggressive operations against some of the country\u2019s most notorious criminals. By 2016 he\u2019d been plucked to head the Intelligence Response Team, an elite unit created to combat a nationwide kidnapping crisis. He was Nigeria\u2019s youngest high-ranking police official.\n\nAs a commander, his exploits were legion. He\u2019d arrested the masterminds of the deadliest robbery in Nigeria\u2019s history and captured the country\u2019s deadliest kidnapper, nicknamed the Vampire. He\u2019d nabbed bombers and arms dealers and taken on the terrorist organization Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to send a message to the criminals,\u201d he said in a BBC documentary on his efforts to stem kidnapping. \u201cKyari and his people will follow you wherever you are, and they will never forget.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most famously, in March 2016, Kyari and his men took over the case of three girls snatched by a gang of kidnappers from a school in Lagos and held for six days. His team reportedly used intelligence from the kidnappers\u2019 families to track them down and recover the girls unharmed.\n\nThe operation earned him a presidential medal of courage. \u201cHe has become known as the saving grace of the Nigeria Police,\u201d declared the online news outlet the Eagle. By 2019, Kyari was widely rumored to be in line\u2014and angling\u2014for the job of inspector general, the top cop.\n\nBeneath the accolades, however, was a disquieting undercurrent. \u201cWe had been concerned about the rogue activities of both SARS and the Intelligence Response Team under him,\u201d says Okechukwu Nwanguma, executive director of the Rule of Law & Accountability Advocacy Centre, a police watchdog group.\n\nKyari\u2019s teams, Nwanguma says, \u201cwere involved in all manner of criminal activities: obstruction, abduction, intimidation, torture, killings.\u201d\n\nAnother human-rights advocate, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, detailed years of interviews with arrestees who accused Kyari\u2019s officers of abuses.\n\nUnder Kyari\u2019s direction, both men allege, his teams routinely targeted business people for arrest, extorted money from suspects and their families, and in some cases committed extrajudicial killings.\n\nIn a decade of tracking Kyari, Nwanguma says, he was rarely able to collect enough evidence from intimidated victims to challenge the police.\n\nBut he estimates that there were hundreds of other cases of abuse: \u201cThey would just abduct somebody and say, \u2018We are investigating somebody\u2014we saw your name in his phone.\u2019 And they take the person.\u201d\n\nThe scam had already succeeded at this point, but why not try for more?\n\nIn one incident in 2015, SARS officers under Kyari were accused of torturing and killing an innocent car dealer in Edo State, in Southern Nigeria, and using the dead man\u2019s ATM card to clean out his bank accounts.\n\nFive officers were later convicted for the murder. In 2017 a lawyer for a kidnapper whom Kyari had arrested publicly suggested the officers had extorted money and jewelry from the defendant.\n\nA year later the widow of a kidnapper who\u2019d been killed in a gun battle with police accused Kyari\u2019s crew of appropriating her late husband\u2019s assets. In mid-2019 a judge ordered Kyari and his team to produce a suspect whose lawyer couldn\u2019t find him and believed he\u2019d died in custody.\n\nAll these accusations rolled off Kyari, who didn\u2019t respond to calls and messages seeking comment for this story. He continued to rack up arrests. His Instagram post on Dec. 14, 2019, showed him accepting an award from a Nigerian bank security group in Lagos.\n\nIn a post from Dec. 17, he stood in front of a group of prisoners seated on the ground, identified in the caption as \u201c72 Notorious Kidnappers/Armed Robbers/Car Snatchers.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time, in mid-December, according to the U.S., that Hushpuppi joined a scam already in progress. This con was more old-school than the business email compromise schemes he was a part of.\n\nIt was a high-level version of a basic advance fee scam: Pay us a little upfront, the scammer says, and we\u2019ll guarantee you a huge windfall later. The upfront asks to keep coming, and the windfall never arrives.\n\nIn this case, the day before his purple Rolls post, Abbas received a message from a Kenyan entrepreneur named Abdulrahman Juma. According to prosecutors, Juma offered to include Abbas in an advance fee scam with an eager mark: a business person hoping to build an international school in Qatar.\n\nThe businessperson, whose name and nationality remain sealed in federal court, needed a $15 million loan for the project and hired a financial adviser to help secure it.\n\nUnfortunately, the adviser\u2019s assistance amounted to Googling sources of multimillion-dollar loans.\n\nThat search led to Juma and his Nairobi company, Westload Financial Solutions Ltd.\n\nWestload\u2019s website promised, \u201cfinancial solutions specialize in financing projects from inception right through operations.\u201d That the site was riddled with errors, including occasionally referring to the company as \u201cWest Financial,\u201d failed to raise any red flags.\n\nIn November 2019 the businessperson traveled to meet Juma and a colleague at Westload\u2019s offices, on the sixth floor of a modern glass office tower in Nairobi\u2019s business district.\n\nThere, according to the U.S. government\u2019s allegations, Juma signed a contract to arrange the $15 million loan in exchange for a $164,000 upfront \u201cconsultancy\u201d payment (the advance fee).\n\nThe next day the businessperson sent the upfront fee to a law firm of Juma\u2019s choice. Neither Juma, Westload nor the law firm responded to emails and calls seeking comment.\n\nThe scam had already succeeded at this point, but why not try for more? When the businessperson complained that the money hadn\u2019t arrived in his account in Qatar, Juma said it was stuck and it would take an additional $150,000 to release\u2014essentially, a second advance fee.\n\nOnce again, the businessperson paid up, no doubt hoping it was the final key to the supposed loan. At this point, according to the court documents, Juma engaged Abbas to help with yet another round of the con. Abbas would pose as a bank manager in the U.S. who could unstick the loan.\n\nVia WhatsApp, Abbas messaged the businessperson from a New York City phone number, introducing himself as \u201cMalik,\u201d the \u201cdirector of the bank responsible for crediting you the funds.\u201d\n\nHe said that because the Qatari government was under U.S. sanctions, the money would have to go through an American account (which was true enough), and he\u2019d be happy to create one. And so he did.\n\nFirst, Abbas arranged for a contact in Los Angeles to register a company with the same name as the businessperson\u2019s Qatari company. Then he had a Wells Fargo account opened for the business.\n\nThere was just one last obstacle, \u201cMalik\u201d now told the businessperson: They\u2019d also need an account in the U.K. to receive the money. He said he\u2019d open an \u201cinvestor\u2019s account with our private banking service over there\u201d for an advance fee of $330,000.\n\nAfter a week of hesitation, the businessperson wired $230,000 of the total to a bank \u201cMalik\u201d provided. As it happened, the account belonged to a watch dealer in Florida, and the amount exactly covered a rose-gold and titanium Richard Mille RM 11-03 that Abbas had coveted.\n\n\u201cMalik\u201d had the businessperson send the other $100,000 to a Capital One account held by another Abbas associate. Abbas used half of it to purchase bogus citizenship from St. Kitts and Nevis\u2014a transaction that involved bribing a government official and faking a marriage certificate.\n\nA week later the watch made its first appearance on Hushpuppi\u2019s Instagram feed. In the image he was standing on the royal purple carpet of the Palazzo Versace Dubai, sporting a Gucci Mickey Mouse T-shirt, his Richard-Mille-clad arm held lightly across it.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things I learned that keeps me going,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to \u2018Never take criticism from people I\u2019d never go-to for an advice\u2019 \u201d\n\nBy January 2020, according to prosecutors, Abbas and Juma were ready for another go. Abbas called on a compatriot in Nigeria, Vincent Kelly Chibuzo, to create a bogus Wells Fargo website and automated support line, which \u201cMalik\u201d passed on to the businessperson.\n\nWhen he called the phone number, the system said the $15 million had come through. \u201cOMG, I can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s true,\u201d the businessperson wrote to \u201cMalik.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s next story was that the businessperson owed a \u201cwithholding tax\u201d of $575,000 to get the money from the U.S.\n\n\u201cAre u proud of me or not?\u201d Abbas asked Juma, by text, when they\u2019d enacted the next phase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect job bro,\u201d Juma replied.\n\nPerfect, but for one flaw: Chibuzo, according to the allegations, began complaining that he deserved a bigger share of the spoils. When Abbas ignored him, Chibuzo decided to strike out on his own.\n\nOn Jan. 13 he called the businessperson directly and told him both Juma and \u201cMalik\u201d were \u201cfake.\u201d The businessperson should stop paying them, he said. They should pay Chibuzo, instead: It was he who could actually free up the loan.\n\nThe now-baffled businessperson relayed all this to Juma, who forwarded it to Abbas. Abbas replied that he would \u201cdeal with\u201d Chibuzo. A few minutes later, according to the complaint, he called Kyari.\n\n\u201cI want him to go through the serious beating of his life\u201d\n\nThe connection between the influencer and the Super Cop went back to at least the previous September when Kyari paid a visit to Dubai for unknown reasons.\n\nThe origins of their relationship are murky, but according to court documents, Abbas loaned Kyari a car and driver for his stay. A few weeks later, Kyari sent Abbas a slideshow of photos from the trip and an article about his recent arrest of a kidnapper.\n\n\u201cAm really happy to be ur boy,\u201d Abbas responded. \u201cI promise to be a good boy to u, sir.\u201d Unusually for the two prolific Instagram users, both fond of being seen with other famous people, neither ever posted about the other. Whatever the nature of their connection, it wasn\u2019t something they wanted to publicize.\n\nNow, in January 2020, it seemed Abbas was looking for help in neutralizing his scam partner gone rogue. Moments after reaching out to Kyari about Chibuzo, Abbas updated Juma.\n\n\u201cSetting him up already,\u201d he messaged. In a message to Chibuzo, he was more explicit. \u201cU have committed a crime that won\u2019t be forgiven,\u201d he said. \u201cIn due time I swear with my life you will regret messing with me, you will even wish you died before my hands will touch you.\u201d\n\nBy Jan. 20 it appeared his threat had been fulfilled. Kyari sent Abbas a headshot of Chibuzo looking despondent. \u201cWe have arrested the guy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is in my Cell now. This is his picture after we arrested him today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want him to go through the serious beating of his life,\u201d Abbas responded. He explained how Chibuzo had double-crossed him in the scam, attempting to \u201cdivert the money\u201d to himself.\n\n\u201cOk I understand,\u201d Kyari replied.\n\n\u201cPlease sir I want to spend money to send this boy to jail, let him go for a very long time,\u201d Abbas continued. \u201cLet me know how I can send money to the team sir, let them deal with him like an armed robber. \u2026 I want him to suffer for many years.\u201d\n\nKyari texted a Nigerian bank account number to Abbas. According to prosecutors, this step completed the crime, making Kyari and his team cops for hire, paid to commit a false arrest.\n\nThe same day, a photo on Kyari\u2019s Instagram showed him at a press conference, standing by the podium for the announcement of the arrest of 60 kidnappers. \u201cNigeria Police will Never relent,\u201d the caption read, \u201cin the fight against these deadly Criminals.\u201d\n\nIncredibly, even after Chibuzo\u2019s attempt at sabotage, the advance fee scam continued. The businessperson, perhaps so confounded by the dizzying back-and-forth that he was able to internalize only half of what Chibuzo had said, confessed to \u201cMalik\u201d that Juma had taken him for more than a million dollars.\n\n\u201cI know that you think I am stupid, but I trusted him and now I\u2019m going bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d came the reply. \u201cOver one million?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalik,\u201d naturally, offered to help, telling the businessperson he could get him out of the mess for a fee of $180,000. He would also report Juma to the FBI, he said. He didn\u2019t, naturally, but now the partnership was falling apart.\n\nIt was every man for himself. Juma complained to Abbas that the businessperson was calling his office and accusing him of being a scammer. Abbas replied that Juma had only himself to blame.\n\nJuma hadn\u2019t found a way to keep the story going, but Abbas had. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when u leave a client hanging, u take the money and no follow up,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cGives the client time to think and involve people.\u201d\n\nAfter Chibuzo had been in custody a month\u2014including time in the hospital for a painful rash he\u2019d acquired in jail\u2014Kyari allegedly messaged Abbas to say that Chibuzo\u2019s girlfriend had offered a bribe for his release.\n\n\u201cThey were thinking it\u2019s a normal arrest that is why they think money can remove him,\u201d Kyari wrote. \u201cNo money can remove him here. Hahahaha.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, a few days later, Abbas messaged Kyari that he was free to let him go.\n\nChibuzo was finally freed, presumably frightened into silence. Neither he nor his girlfriend, whose name wasn\u2019t disclosed in the court documents, could be reached for comment.\n\nThe scam reached its final turn in March 2020, after Abbas had extracted an additional $180,000 in transfers, for a grand total of $1.1 million in advance fees.\n\n\u201cSorry Mr. Malik,\u201d the businessperson wrote in a final message, \u201cbut I\u2019m not gonna pay more and I\u2019m out of this game.\u201d He had finally put it together that \u201cMalik\u201d and Juma were \u201call one team.\u201d\n\nAbbas\u2019s time in the game, too, was coming to an end. Three months later, after midnight on June 8, armed officers from a Dubai SWAT team stormed his penthouse and arrested everyone inside.\n\nWithin a few days, Abbas was on a plane to the U.S., in FBI custody for his role in other, more complex email scams.\n\nIf Kyari was concerned, he didn\u2019t note it publicly. His own rise appeared to continue unabated. Three days after Abbas\u2019s arrest, the National Assembly presented Kyari with a special commendation for outstanding service.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the image of the police in Nigeria,\u201d the speaker of the House of Representatives noted, \u201cthe House recognizes that some police officers are exceptional.\u201d\n\nIn his own personal image-making, Kyari\u2019s Instagram showed him drifting a bit further toward Hushpuppi\u2019s scene.\n\nIn October 2020 he was pictured in his office with the Nigerian pop star Davido, once a friend of Hushpuppi.\n\nThe following July, Kyari was spotted at the funeral of the mother of Obinna Iyiegbu, a nightclub owner popularly known as Obi Cubana, who\u2019d been questioned as part of both drug and fraud investigations. (Cubana has not been charged in those investigations.) Cubana, Kyari noted on Facebook, was \u201ca brother and a good friend.\u201d\n\nThen, on July 28, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Abbas had pleaded guilty to money laundering. The same day, the Justice Department revealed that it had indicted Juma, Chibuzo, Kyari, and three U.S.-based defendants on charges of conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering.\n\nJuma, Abbas, and Chibuzo were accused of directly fleecing the businessperson, while Nigeria\u2019s Super Cop was alleged to have aided the conspiracy by jailing Chibuzo in exchange for a bribe.\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest news outlets splashed the Kyari allegations across their front pages and broke down Abbas\u2019s scam in minute detail.\n\n\u201cHow Hushpuppi bought Richard Mille wristwatch worn on Instagram,\u201d read the headline in the newspaper The Punch. \u201cThe indictment from the U.S. court came as a shock to everyone,\u201d says Rommy Mom, a member of the Police Service Commission. \u201cThis is someone who had been decorated from the top.\u201d\n\nNot everyone was shocked, of course. Nwanguma, of the Rule of Law & Accountability Advocacy Centre, says he and his peers felt vindicated. In the police force, he says, \u201cthere are quite a number of good people, but the system is so corrupt that it breeds and encourages people.\n\nIt provides them the environment to commit a crime and get away with it.\u201d\n\nAs befits a celebrity cop, Kyari turned first to social media to defend himself. He posted a long Facebook message, since deleted, claiming that he\u2019d only assisted Abbas in investigating threats against his life.\n\nRead also: Arrested Abba Kyari, 4 others to face full weight of the law- NDLEA\n\nThe bank account numbers he\u2019d supplied Abbas, he explained, were for payments to a seller of \u201cnative clothes and caps.\u201d Kyari had facilitated the transaction, he claimed, after Abbas had admired them on his Instagram page.\n\nThe Police Service Commission suspended Kyari from the force, pending an investigation by the inspector general of police. After the commission received an initial investigative report in December, it determined the report had \u201cgaps\u201d and demanded further digging.\n\n\u201cWe should wrap this up before April,\u201d Mom, the commission member, said in an interview in early February. He said the commission has faced no pressure from police higher-ups and that its decision will be made independently.\n\nJuma is currently in custody in Kenya, awaiting a judge\u2019s decision on extradition, and Chibuzo\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. For months, whether Kyari will be extradited to the U.S. has remained an open question.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mom says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been any extradition request filed.\u201d The U.S. Department of Justice Office of International Affairs, which handles extraditions, declined to comment on the state of Kyari\u2019s case.\n\nBut one Justice Department official insisted that Kyari\u2019s was more than simply a \u201cname and shame\u201d indictment.\n\nIn a TV interview in early February, the Nigerian attorney general allowed that there were \u201cprima facie reasonable grounds of suspicion\u201d for prosecution and that Nigeria was in contact with the U.S.\n\nEven facing potential disgrace and extradition, Kyari seemed unable to avoid the spotlight.\n\nAt the end of January, he posted photos to Instagram and Facebook from the wedding of the son of the inspector general of police\u2014the person in charge of investigating him.\n\nObi Cubana, the nightclub owner, was there, too. After a media uproar, Kyari deleted the posts.\n\nThen, on Feb. 14, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in Nigeria announced that Kyari was suspected of another major crime.\n\nThe agency alleged that in late January, while supposedly suspended, Kyari had contacted an NDLEA officer saying he and his IRT team had confiscated a 25-kilogram shipment of cocaine.\n\nOver several conversations, Kyari allegedly suggested that they join forces to keep and sell most of the seizure, leave some for the prosecution, and split the proceeds. \u201cThe boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal,\u201d he allegedly said of his team. \u201cI do take good care of them.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA officer reported the approach and, outfitted with a wire, collected the money from Kyari. When Kyari then failed to show up for questioning, he was declared a wanted man.\n\n\u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal,\u201d the NDLEA said in its statement, \u201cthe Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This Saturday\u2019s election will determine his date. The party has already said that we should conduct election after four years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a sin to contest for a position in a democratic government, the constitution of the party stipulated that after four years we can change our candidate, but if he abides by the tenet of the party, we will support him for another term but if we see that he is doing things against the interest of the party, it the duty of the leaders and party members to vote against such person at the primary.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Oyetola assumed office, he has waged war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as governor, I told him that I heard him and now he is the governor, what else is the problem?\n\n\u201cHe thought he can destroy me through my work, nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately toed that path. He wagged war against me. He refused to listen to my please until he got rid of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I observed that he would not listen, I called people together that they should start telling people that progressives family must not spoil.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones that bore the flag of this party, we fought for it since 2004.

With the Waste Museum, we are showcasing the value of waste,\u201d Olowookere said.\n\n\u201cWe want people to see how waste can be turned into wealth.

Those we assisted are now against us and we have reported them to God. He (Oyetola) will not return for second term.\n\n\u201cEven if Bola Ige comes back to this earth, he will join us,\u201d Aregbesola said in Ikire, as he doubled down on his campaign against the candidacy of Oyetola.\n\nHe said Saturday\u2019s primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would determine Oyetola\u2019s fate in office.\n\nAregbesola has declared his support for the immediate past Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, as his preferred candidate to fly the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nOyetola, on his part, is seeking to win the party\u2019s ticket to actualise his second-term bid, and moves in the camps of the two leaders have heightened tensions in the state.\n\nAregbesola, who spoke in Yoruba, said Oyetola had been in battle with him since assumption of office.\n\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s primary election will determine his fate. The party has already said that we should conduct election after four years.\n\n\u201cI campaigned passionately for him under the rain, but he is now my enemy. I begged him for two years and even sent people to him but he refused. Everything we did together for eight years, he destroyed.\n\nBut the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Oyetola, Ismail Omipidan, said Aregbesola is not God and cannot determine the fate of his principal.\n\nOmipidan said that his principal had absolute faith in God and the people of Osun, adding that in the last three years plus, the people can tell the difference in terms of responsible and responsive governance and politics.\n\n\u201cThe general belief among most Africans that a man\u2019s life is preordained and ruled by God, has continued to play out in the political trajectory of Oyetola.\n\n\u201cFrom 2011 when he was appointed Chief of Staff to 2018 when, against all odds, he emerged, first as the candidate of the APC, and later, Governor of the State, at a time when many thought it was all over for him, it was obvious that he was on a divine political course.\n\n\u201cMy Principal has absolute faith in God and the people of Osun. In these last three years plus, the people can tell the difference in terms of responsible and responsive governance and politics.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is God and Osun people that will determine Oyetola\u2019s fate, not an individual trying to play God,\u201d Omipidan said.",

Lawyers for Donald Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe decision followed a two-hour hearing in which the Trumps\u2019 lawyers accused James of doing an end run around their clients\u2019 constitutional rights by seeking testimony she could them use against them in a parallel criminal probe.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s lawyer Alina Habba accused James of \u201cselective prosecution and prosecutorial misconduct that this country has never seen,\u201d citing statements reflecting the Democratic attorney general\u2019s \u201cvile disdain\u201d for Trump.\n\n\u201cIf he was not who he is, she would not be doing this,\u201d Habba said. \u201cThis court can help stop this circus.\u201d\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer from James\u2019 office, rejected that characterization.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t shown anything here that says it\u2019s unfair,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nLast month, James said her nearly three-year investigation into the Trump Organization had uncovered significant evidence of possible fraud.\n\nShe described what she called misleading statements about the values of the \u201cTrump Brand\u201d and six Trump properties, saying the company may have inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans and reduced them to lower tax bills.\n\nThe investigation partially overlaps a criminal probe now led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in which the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer pleaded not guilty last July to tax fraud charges.\n\nJames joined that probe last May.\n\nTrump, who has not announced whether he will run again for president in 2024, has called James\u2019 investigation a political \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and is suing to try to stop it.\n\nThe hearing followed last week\u2019s decision by Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA to cut ties with him and the Trump Organization, saying it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements.\n\nLawyers for Donald Trump have said he did not know enough to respond to allegations of inaccurate valuations, though Trump detailed some possible discrepancies in a five-page statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trumps have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nWashington D.C.\u2019s attorney general is separately suing the Trump Organization and Trump\u2019s inaugural committee over the alleged misuse of $1.1 million of charitable funds.\n\nA Sept. 26 trial date was set on Thursday.\n\nSource: Reuters via NAN",

So I\u2019m appealing to them to come and Kano state is almost one hundred percent APC, we will come together and forge ahead in such a manner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor also confirmed that the APC national secretariat had given Abbas a certificate of return as the APC state chairman.\n\nGanduje said: \u201cFirst of all we have to thank God for this very important victory at the moment. As he rightly said, we APC of Kano state have got a judgement that all the elections we conducted from the wards to the state level are legally recognised.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the party and the leadership for initiating the peace move to ensure that our party is united. I have to thank the party for that. A judgement has been passed in our favour and APC stakeholders in Kano are here to show our appreciation to the leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have the house leader, senator, other representatives, representatives of the 44 local government chairmen, state assembly members, elected councillors from Kano state and to you the members of the press for covering all the court proceedings.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ganduje was accompanied by Senator Kabiru Gaya, Majority Leader House of Representatives, Hon Ado Doguwa, among other party chieftains from Kano state.\n\n",

          "text": "The United States said Thursday that Russia is on the verge of unleashing a massive military attack against Ukraine, dismissing Moscow\u2019s claim to be pulling forces back, as artillery fire hit a Ukrainian kindergarten.\n\nIn a dramatic, previously unscheduled speech to the United Nations in New York, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said intelligence showed Moscow could order an assault on its neighbor in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d\n\nWith US and other Western governments saying they see no evidence to support Russia\u2019s claim to be withdrawing, Blinken challenged the Kremlin to \u201cannounce today with no qualification, equivocation or deflection that Russia will not invade Ukraine. State it clearly. State it plainly to the world.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Rescuers Battle To Save Boy Trapped In Afghan Well\n\n\u201cDemonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, your planes, back to their barracks and hangers, and sending your diplomats to the negotiating table,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia denies any invasion plans but warned of \u201cmilitary-technical measures\u201d if its far-reaching demands for a US and NATO pullback from eastern Europe aren\u2019t satisfied.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, at the White House, accused Moscow of preparing a \u201cfalse flag operation\u201d as a pretext for an attack and said this could happen \u201cin the next several days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have not moved any of their troops out. They\u2019ve moved more troops in,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEvery indication we have is that they\u2019re prepared to go into Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, that diplomacy is not dead. \u201cThere is a path. There is a way through this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Forced to respond\u2019\n\nRussia has massed enormous air, land and sea forces around Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin and officials say they do not plan to invade Ukraine and that the troops are only conducting practice exercises.\n\nHowever, Putin has made clear that the price for removing any threat would be Ukraine agreeing never to join NATO and for the Western alliance to pull back from a swath of eastern Europe, effectively splitting the continent into Cold War-style spheres of influence. Ukraine is far from being ready to join NATO but has set this as part of a broader goal to integrate with the democracies of western Europe, making a historic break from Russia\u2019s orbit.\n\nThe United States said Thursday that it had received Putin\u2019s response to its offers of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but did not give any reaction to the contents.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry indicated that there was little to discuss.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of will on the American side to negotiate firm and legally binding guarantees on our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including with military-technical measures,\u201d the foreign ministry said.\n\n\u201cWe insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,\u201d it added.\n\nRussia also expelled the number two US diplomat in Moscow, the US State Department said, condemning the \u201cunprovoked\u201d action.\n\nArtillery fire on kindergarten\n\nRussia took over Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and began backing heavily armed separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014, sparking a war that has already cost thousands of lives.\n\nSporadic fighting remains common in the east and the Ukrainian army accused the pro-Russian separatists of 34 ceasefire breaches on Thursday, 28 of them using heavy weapons.\n\nThe potentially most serious incident \u2014 an example of the kind of spark that many fear could ignite far more intense fighting \u2014 was the shelling of a kindergarten in the village of Stanytsia-Luganska. Children were inside but none were hit.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the attack \u201cby pro-Russian forces is a big provocation.\u201d\n\nRussian news agencies meanwhile quoted authorities in the separatist Lugansk region saying they blamed Kyiv after the situation on the frontline \u201cescalated significantly.\u201d\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described Thursday\u2019s reports as \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we\u2019ll be watching this very closely,\u201d Austin told journalists after a meeting with NATO counterparts.\n\nWestern capitals say they are also concerned by the Russian parliament\u2019s request that Putin grant unilateral recognition of independence for the separatists in eastern Ukraine, probably ending chances of reuniting the country.\n\n\u201cIf this request were accepted, it would\u2026 demonstrate a Russian decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.\n\nPutin earlier this week claimed with no evidence that Ukraine is committing \u201cgenocide\u201d in the eastern region.\n\nDisputed pull-out\n\nMoscow has made several announcements of troop withdrawals this week and on Thursday said that units of the southern and western military districts, including tank units, had begun returning to their bases from near Ukraine.\n\nDefense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said some troops had returned to their garrisons in several areas far from the border, including Chechnya and Dagestan in the North Caucasus, and near Nizhny Novgorod, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nThe United States, NATO and Ukraine all said they had seen no evidence of a pullback, with Washington saying Russia had in fact moved 7,000 more troops near the border.\n\nAccording to US officials, there are now about 150,000 Russian troops arrayed in offensive groupings on the southern, eastern and northern borders of Ukraine.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Trump Must Testify in New York Investigation, Judge Rules",
          "text": "Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath in New York state\u2019s civil investigation into his business practices, a judge ruled Thursday.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., to comply with subpoenas issued in December by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump and his two children must sit for a deposition within 21 days, Engoron said.\n\nEngoron issued the ruling after a two-hour hearing with lawyers for the Trumps and James\u2019 office.\n\n\u201cIn the final analysis, a State Attorney General commences investigating a business entity, uncovers copious evidence of possible financial fraud, and wants to question, under oath, several of the entities\u2019 principals, including its namesake. She has the clear right to do so.\u201d Engoron wrote in his decision.\n\nThe ruling is almost certain to be appealed, but if upheld it could force the former president into a tough decision about whether to answer questions, or stay silent, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination.\n\nSpokespeople for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.\n\nJames, a Democrat, said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump\u2019s company used \u201cfraudulent or misleading\u201d valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers told Engoron during the hearing that having him sit for a civil deposition now, while his company is also the subject of a parallel criminal investigation, is an improper attempt to get around a state law barring prosecutors from calling someone to testify before a criminal grand jury without giving them immunity.\n\n\u201cIf she wants sworn testimony from my client, he\u2019s entitled to immunity. He gets immunity for what he says, or he says nothing,\u201d Trump\u2019s criminal defense lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, said in the hearing, which was conducted by video conference.\n\nIf Trump were to testify in the civil probe, anything he says could be used against him in the criminal investigation being overseen by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nTrump could invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in a deposition \u2014 something he\u2019s criticized others for doing in the past. But Fischetti said if Trump did so, it could still hurt a potential criminal defense.\n\n\u201cIf he goes in and follows my advice, which will be you cannot answer these questions without \u2026 immunity because that\u2019s what the law provides, and take the Fifth Amendment, that\u2019ll be on every front page in the newspaper in the world. And how can I possibly pick a jury in that case?\u201d Fischetti said.\n\nA lawyer for the attorney general\u2019s office, Kevin Wallace, told the judge that it wasn\u2019t unusual to have civil and criminal investigations proceeding at the same time.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is a high profile individual, yes. That\u2019s unique,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIt\u2019s unique that so many people are paying attention to a rather dry hearing about subpoena enforcement. But the the legal issues that we\u2019re dealing with here are pretty standard.\u201d\n\nAnother Trump son, Eric Trump, and the Trump Organization\u2019s finance chief Allen Weisselberg, have previously sat for depositions in the civil investigation \u2014 and invoked their Fifth Amendment rights hundreds of times when they were questioned by investigators in 2020.\n\nAnother lawyer for Donald Trump, Alina Habba, accused James of trying to use the civil investigation to gather evidence for the criminal probe.\n\nShe said the civil investigation should be stayed until the criminal matter is over, claiming James\u2019 office is putting the Trumps \u201cin a position where they either disclose evidence in a civil investigation or they have to invoke the constitutional right not to testify, thereby triggering an adverse inference in the civil action.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that fair, your Honor? We have to stop one,\u201d she said.\n\nAlan Futerfas, a lawyer for Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom have been executives in their family\u2019s Trump Organization, said during the court hearing that so far he had no reason to believe either are targets of the district attorney\u2019s criminal investigation.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Trump railed against what he called a \u201csham investigation of a great company that has done a spectacular job for New York and beyond\u201d and a racially motivated \u201ccontinuation of a Witch Hunt the likes of which has never been seen in this Country before.\u201d\n\nHabba argued at Thursday\u2019s hearing that James\u2019 investigation is \u201cselective prosecution\u201d and that the attorney general is \u201cengaging in viewpoint discrimination\u201d motivated by her political ambitions and disdain for the Republican former president, evinced by comments she made over the years about going after Trump.\n\n\u201cWe have an extraordinary rare case where we can prove selective prosecution because she\u2019s put her words out there so much and taken every opportunity to voice her vendetta against Donald Trump and his family to take him down,\u201d Habba said.\n\nWallace noted the state attorney general\u2019s office was investigating Trump-related matters as far back as 2013, including probes into his charitable foundation and a Trump University real estate training program that started long before James was elected.\n\nIn a court filing this week, James included a letter from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm advising him to no longer rely on years of financial statements it prepared based on his company\u2019s valuations, given the questions about their accuracy.\n\nJames tweeted after the ruling Thursday: \u201cNo one will be permitted to stand in the way of the pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are.\u201d\n\nLast summer, spurred by evidence uncovered in James\u2019 civil investigation, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office charged Weisselberg and the Trump Organization with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation.

          "text": "More details have emerged on how suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari earned the undying loyalty of operatives of the elite police group, the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), a relationship he was said to have built way back.\n\nIt has been revealed that despite his suspension, Kyari still had his hold on the operatives and called the shots under the table through his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, who was also seconded to Disu.\n\nThe IRT, an elite unit set up by then Inspector General of Police, was to tackle high profile crimes like kidnapping and even terrorism.\n\nHeaded then by Kyari, the team soon made its mark as a squad that was out to tackle crime given the constant arrests and the category of cases they busted.\n\nBut Kyari did not come upon such a team by happenstance; he had groomed them from Lagos, when he was the commander in charge-of-the-state (Special Anti Robbery Squad SARS), although now disbanded.\n\nWhile at SARS, the team forged stronger through cracking cases but were at different times accused of extra judicial killings and other allegations of fraud and obtaining money from families of suspects to release them.\n\nThe case that brought him to national limelight was that of Evans Onwuamadike, the \u2018Billionaire kidnapper\u2019, who was arrested by Kyari and his team.\n\nAlthough the ground work that led to his arrest was done by DCP Tunji Disu, who was at that time the Commander of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) with support from then Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, Kyari and men took the glory and promotions that came with it.\n\nBut the high profile arrest was tainted by how Kyari\u2019s men allegedly re-looted the loot Evans obtained from his victims, forcefully.\n\nDuring the raid, the operatives were alleged to have packed both local and foreign currencies, exotic phones, designer wristwatches, jewelry, television and even glass cups.\n\nIn a petition by Evans through his lawyers, he accused Kyari and men of forcibly taking N50 million from him and N5million from his wife under the pretext that he would be released on bail.\n\nEvans also deposed in the affidavit that he was dispossessed of $10,000 by the same police officers.\n\nFor each operation, the bond between Kyari and men forged stronger as they weathered one allegation after the other.\n\nIt was part of measures by the police hierarchy to cut the seeming excesses of the group that IRT alongside the STS, was integrated into the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) headed by Ibrahim Lamorde.\n\nIn spite of that move, the team was still dogged with countless petitions and allegations of human rights abuse and corruption. Yet, there was seemingly nothing much the authorities could do because of the godfathers said to be behind Kyari.\n\nBut following his suspension by the PSC on the recommendation of the present IGP, Baba, over the Hushpuppi case, it seemed he was finally caged.\n\nUnbeknownst to the police hierarchy, he was still calling the shots at the IRT despite the capable hands of DCP Tunji Disu, who was detailed by the IG to take over the unit.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that Kyari was still carrying out discreet illegal operations through his then deputy, who was as well seconded to Disu, when he assumed office.\n\nA senior officer, who spoke on anonymity to THISDAY from the force headquarters said when Ubua was questioned by the IG, he said he was forced to obey orders from Kyari, because the suspended DCP assured him he would soon be reinstated by the force.\n\nBut when the NDLEA authorities briefed the IG on the case against Kyari and his men, they were all invited for questioning and Disu said he handed over to his deputy, because he had an operation to carry out in Sokoto.\n\nThis much was confirmed by the deputy, who said he carried out the operation without informing the head of the unit on the request of Kyari.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe force is at a terrible spot at the moment. How did DCP Kyari think for a moment that he would be reinstated after the FBI fiasco? Who was giving him such assurance? It was a stunned IG, who heard that he kept assuring his boys that DCP Disu would be removed and he would be reinstated.\n\n\u201cThat, however, does not exonerate ACP Ubua, who should know better than to place loyalty to man over the police force he pledged to serve. The only good thing that came out from this was that the IG finally signed the appeal by DCP Disu to allow him raise his own team and not use those inherited from his predecessor.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY carried out subsequent checks on what gave Kyari such hopes that he would be cleared as usual and reinstated despite the damning allegations by FBI.\n\nAnother source in the know said Kyari was parroting that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was behind his woes.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen the Hushpuppi incident happened, he reassured us that it would soon fizzle out and he would be reinstated. According to him, his woes were orchestrated by IPOB given that he had arrested some of them in different operations.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the FBI lawyer had Igbo affiliations and was probably sympathetic to the Biafra cause. So, we shouldn\u2019t worry, because his godfathers were on top of the case to get him reinstated.\u201d\n\nBut contrary to allegations that the police authorities had scrapped IRT and STS, the IG has set plans in motion to sanitise the units by posting fresh officers that would be ready to take instructions from their commander.\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The forthcoming convention of Nigeria\u2019s All Progressive Congress (APC) has split governors elected under the political party into three different groups.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while the group of second term governors want the convention to hold as planned and are assiduously working towards settling for a candidate; the second group which is made up of mainly first term governors want the convention either postponed and a mechanism to return the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee designed so that Buni can continue. On the other hand, a third group of governors also want the convention to hold, and for Buni to continue or the convention postponed.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt that President Muhammadu Buhari met with Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi before he travelled on the matter, and the decision they both arrived is yet to be disclosed.\n\nNevertheless, due to the development, there is palpable tension, apprehension, and misgivings in the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) over the choice of a consensus national chairman for the APC as there were also indications last night that the leadership of the party had begun to consider March for a possible new date for its national convention, earlier slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nBut one of the frontrunners for the chairmanship position, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, told THISDAY on Wednesday that February 26 remained \u201csacrosanct\u201d. Mustapha said with the kind of energy the caretaker committee was devoting to preparations for the convention he believed they knew what to do.\n\nMustapha told THISDAY, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dispute or argue over speculation, since they have not come out officially to say it will hold or it will not hold. For now, we will still retain earlier information that February 26 is sacrosanct. So, if anything is contrary to that, we will have to wait for the official channel of the party to report it to all of us.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, the interim national leadership of the party was forced to fix February 26 for the convention, after pressure from the APC governors and other aggrieved stakeholders, who had expressed their displeasures over foot-dragging on the matter.\n\nA crucial meeting between Buhari and the APC governors to fine-tune the zoning of offices and other matters during the convention could not hold on Tuesday as the president met with only Fayemi on behalf of the governors.\n\nThe meeting with the APC governors to fine-tune zoning, was to enable the president disclose his preferred chairmanship aspirant to the governors and pave the way for the zoning of other National Working Committee (NWC) offices.\n\nExplaining why the meeting did not hold as scheduled, a source in the presidency told THISDAY yesterday in Abuja that Buhari told some governors, who met with him individually that there was nothing on ground to suggest that the Buni committee was preparing for the national convention.\n\nThe president, who left for Brussels to attend an African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) summit, had met with some of the governors, who had arrived at the villa early for the botched meeting.\n\nThe governors included Ben Ayade (Cross River), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Simeon Lalong (Plateau), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nThe inside source stated, \u201cWe are now looking at March for possible date for the national convention. Like the president said, there is nothing on ground to convince us that the caretaker committee is ready for the convention on February 26.\n\n\u201cFirst, the committee has not been able to come out with a zoning formula for the various positions in the party. And we cannot go into the convention without all these things well-spelt out.\u201d\n\nBoth Uzodimma and Ayade also hinted on Tuesday that the convention date was not sacrosanct.\n\nThe insider explained further that the Buni committee might have deliberately been pussyfooting around the convention because they had all long planned to hold the national convention and the presidential primaries the same day.\n\nA presidency source stated, \u201cThe committee wants to also be the one to conduct the presidential primary, but conducting the national convention on February 26 means that there will be a new national executive committee in place to conduct the presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the agenda of Mai Mala Buni-led committee. As I speak with you, the APC governors and other entrenched interest groups within the party are divided on the matter\n\n\u201cSome governors, who met with the president on Tuesday, asked him who was his preferred chairmanship candidate. But, as usual, the president refused to disclose his interest. He only requested for the list of the 12 aspirants. And their names have been forwarded to the relevant security agencies for scrutiny.\n\n\u201cHowever, the near consensus is that the national chairman of the party should go to the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nBut speaking with THISDAY, Mustapha said he did not want to dispute or speculate on a new date for the convention, since the party had not come out with an official statement on the issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you notice, the trend in the APC, even when the governors met the other time, is that none of them has the authority to pronounce certain things unless endorsed by the authorised organ, and that was why Governor Mai Mala Buni was the one that spoke and gave a specific date for the convention. He is the chairman of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cSo, I will want to restrict myself to waiting for the official right channel to instruct or to indicate where we stand. As at today, I want to believe the convention is going to take place on February 26.\u201d\n\nAsked to rate his chances in the race, the APC national chairmanship hopeful said, \u201cI believe my chances are very bright and the sky is the limit for me. It has been very positive. Among 11 or 12 of us, we do not see it as a do-or-die affair. We have always approached each other as brothers in this game.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I just came across two of my fellow contestants now and the way we were laughing, hugging, playing, was amazing. For us, it is a family affair that can easily be resolved, because for us, we know what it is to have gotten to this point in our journey, and we would try to see that all hands are on deck so as to come out victorious and be able to continue from the gains already recorded by the present administration ably led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nMeanwhike, ahead of the planned convention, there appears to tension and cracks in different camps of the PGF over the choice of a consensus national chairman.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the cracks followed a meeting between the governors of Kebbi State and Jigawa State, Atiku Bagudu and Mohammed Badaru, respectively, who were said to have secretly presented their choice of a consensus national chairman to Buhari, without the knowledge of the other governors.\n\nIt was learnt that the two governors met with the president last week, where they sold the idea of Senator Sani Musa as a consensus national chairman of the APC. But other APC governors on hearing of the meeting rejected the choice of Musa, and insisted it was not made with their consent.\n\nBuhari was said to have clearly told Bagudu and Badaru that due process should be followed in picking the consensus chairman. The president, it was gathered, further told them to meet with Buni and other members to agree on the options that met his criteria.\n\nBut the crisis rocking APC, insiders said, was compounded by the inability of the convention committee to announce a zoning formula for the national convention.\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",
