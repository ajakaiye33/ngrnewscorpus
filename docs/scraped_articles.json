The extremists kidnapped our children and forcefully converted them to Muslims.\n\n\u201cWe have issued statements and called the attention of the government to our plight. We have also reached out to let the government know that we are willing to cooperate towards the greatness of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Bishop, who is the Secretary of the National Peace Committee, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of deliberately appointing more people of his ethnicity and faith into political offices.\n\nALSO READ: Obasanjo advocates for national policy to eradicate cervical cancer in Nigeria\n\nHe said, \u201cThe North, even the whole country is invaded by armed bandits, kidnappers, etc who attack communities at will. The fact that the government seems to be either helpless or uninterested in dealing decisively with these people has added more confusion.\n\n\u201cAnd the contradiction here is that the President has blatantly pursued nepotistic and policies that show very clearly his preferences for men and women of his faith.\u201d\n\nThe Bishop of Sokoto Diocese also said \u201cfor the first time in Nigeria the people heading three arms of government; the President, Senate President Speaker, and Chief Justice are all Muslims. These are all fine gentlemen, but that is not the point. The level of between Christians and Muslims has been exacerbated. This kind of situation has never happened before.\n\n\u201cWhat is significant here is that we are in a democracy; with weak structures, and institutions. These are existential issues. So, we require practical assistance that can help us and our children.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

You can also see the presence of Julius Berger Construction Company at the old Toll Gate axis of this expressway. But we told them to come and fix these failed portions in order to reduce these sufferings, but they wouldn\u2019t listen\u201d.\n\n\u201d I will bring the Honourable Minister of Works and Infrastructure down here so that he can physically see things for himself. If however, they still refused to do it, then, we will do it by ourselves. You can see that we are already reconstructing the Agbara \u2013 Igbesa Industrial highway, which is also a federal road. That one was even worse than this Abeokuta \u2013 Ota \u2013 Lagos expressway.\n\nAbiodun said his administration is willing to reconstruct the Lagos-Sango-Abeokuta and Sango-Idiroko expressway, provided the federal government will honour his requests to adopt the roads for rehabilitation. He said he has made several efforts at speaking with the federal government over possible take over of the roads for reconstruction on which he said the federal government has not given the go-ahead.\n\nALSO READ: Nnamdi Kanu seeks transfer from DSS custody to Kuje Correctional Centre\n\nHe disclosed that he and his counterpart in Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had at different times, engaged the federal government on the need to transfer the rehabilitation of the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway to them as part of the move to ensure that people do not suffer on the roads.\n\n\u201d The state of this road is pitiful, Governor Sanwo-Olu and I have engaged the federal government at different times, to transfer the road to us. We are not by any means not appreciative of the paucity of funds at the situation the federal government finds itself in, our people are suffering and as a state government, we can only do so much, we have intervened on several roads,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201d I have asked the federal government to declare a special status for this state because we have more federal roads than any other state and we are suffering, not just from the environmental impact that the roads are causing us. Our people are suffering and I am in pain\u201d.\u201dThere are several other roads within the Sango and Ota township that we intend to rehabilitate for the benefit of all of us and we will not renege\u201d.\n\n\u201cAssuming the last administration had fixed all these roads prior till now, things wouldn\u2019t have to be like these. Just bear with us\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We thought we had fine very far, not until we noticed that the Land Use Contraventions have been very high and disturbing.\n\n\u201cSo we had to come back here today (Wednesday) to continue the cleanup. Thanks directors of Development Control and Security who out heads together for us to get four to five machines.\n\n\u201cSome of the illegalities of land contravention include buying land from local Chiefs, building without building plan approvals, building substandard structures and the authorities will not allow these to continue because the city is planned and when we see contravention, it is the mandate of the FCTA to take it out\u201d.\n\nAsked whether there was any compensation for them, Attah said: \u201cThey have been warned before and when you commit illegality\u2026..we even ought to take them to court but we are leaving them. The Chiefs who gave them the land have denied that they gave them land\u201d.\n\nAttah also sent a warning to owners of illegal structures within Mpape, Dutse Makaranta, Ushafa and areas to either move out or comply, adding they were next in line for similar clean up exercises.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to rush this work now because the people of Mpape, Dutse Makaranta and Ushafa -both the residents and landlords are begging the FCT Minister to come and clean up their area, so we will soon be going to assist them.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing encroachments even in the Lower Usuma Dam where we get our safe water to drink.

Citizen\u2019s power keeps hope alive for our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, NYCN said the rejection is a victory for democracy and confirmation of the independence of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group, through its president, Isah Abubakar, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advisers against such controversial nominations to avoid a repeat of what could be described as a coup against the Nigeria Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe admonish the leaders of the National Assembly to continue to put Nigeria\u2019s democracy first above party/individual sentiments,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigerians should congratulate themselves for remaining one despite ongoing challenges that could have torn us apart.\n\nA statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said Buhari stated this when he received the report of the National Security Summit held on May 26, 2021by the House of Representatives. The report was submitted by a team of House members led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the President urged leaders to respect the wishes of people and allow them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nHe also restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 states during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the 9th National Assembly for its cooperation with the executive, he said he tried very hard to get the 8th Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much. But time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nHe said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit.\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that would be implemented by the executive.\n\nSpeaking to State House Correspondents after the event, the speaker said the report suggested the creation of regional development commissions for all regions of the country and also proffered resolutions to military complexities.\n\n\u201cThere are several recommendations; we\u2019ve agreed to establish zonal commissions in all the zones like the North East Development Commission. We\u2019ll have the South West, South-South, South East, North West, and that goes a long way in resolving issues, regional and zonal issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "A High Court in Kenya has ordered Safaricom to pay a blind man KSh6 million ($56,000) for failing to hire him after he had gone through the entire recruitment process.\n\nWilson Macharia sued the network operator to seek compensation because his rights were violated, BusinessDaily reported. He told Justice James Makau that Safaricom declined to employ him as a customer care executive on grounds that it did not have specialised software to help him with his work.\n\nMacharia said he responded to an advert by Safaricom in August 2016 for a customer experience executive position, which invited qualified Kenyans irrespective of \u201crace, colour, religion, gender, tribal origin, disability or age\u201d.\n\nAlong with other persons living with disabilities, Macharia was shortlisted for the job, went through the oral interview and medical test, after which he was invited to sign the contract in July 2017. However, Safaricom said the invite was erroneous.\n\nIn its defense, the telecoms firm denied discriminating against the plaintiff and argued that it allowed Macharia to be interviewed for the job but that it lacked specialised software that would enable him to work.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company violated Macharia\u2019s rights and failed to treat him with dignity as it should have informed him earlier that the software was unavailable instead of making him go through the recruitment process only to later claim the letter was sent erroneously.\n\n\u201cI find that the Respondent\u2019s excuse to be an afterthought that was introduced late to the detriment of the Petitioner. The Respondent knew right from the beginning that the Petitioner\u2019s work called for software, yet they took him through all recruitment steps,\u201d Justice Makau ruled.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that there are over 650 million people around the world who live with disabilities; 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school and the literacy rate for adults with disabilities is as low as 3%.\n\nIn addition, millions of people with disabilities want to get jobs but can\u2019t get hired. Even in developed economies, they struggle to find employment.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Flutterwave has appointed Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nIn a statement, the company said Falade\u2019s role will be to provide \u201cstrategic oversight and government relation strategies, while ensuring that the interest and needs of the business are aligned with that of the regulators.\u201d\n\nFalade joins Flutterwave from a similar role at IHS Towers, the Nigerian company that owns 29,700 telecom towers across nine countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Sub Saharan Africa.\n\nBefore IHS, he spent 10 years at MTN in various government and regulatory advisory roles, and four years representing VISA in conversations with West African regulators.\n\nIn appointing a regulatory lead with broad industry experience, Flutterwave expresses an enthusiasm for deeper engagement with African governments. Like other private organisations, tech companies have to answer to the constituted authorities wherever they operate.\n\nThe duty is arguably more pressing and sensitive if the company operates in the financial services industry, where consumer protection and fraud prevention are government priorities.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s payments processing business is live in 33 African countries.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "Spazio Ideale designs iconic workspaces for tech companies like Paystack, uLesson, others",
          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",
          "summary": "The acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers.\nSpazio Ideale team.\nThat\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201dBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new appointment\n\nVerifyMe\u2019s VeriFind launch\n\nMobile app downloads skyrocket\n\nFlutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer, Oluwabankole Falade. Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

Federation Account for the period of January to December, 2015.\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber called on the Corporation to desist from further deduction at source as this contravenes Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nIt also mandated the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) or any other approving authority to, as a matter of urgency, approve agreed percentage which should be allocated to NNPC monthly as operational cost to ensure that their operations are not adversely affected.\n\nThese formed part of the 59 recommendations adopted by the Senate and contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the annual report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Accounts of the Federation for the years ended 31st

the Federation Account, but kept in an account maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria contravenes the provisions of Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe chamber, therefore, charged the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) to fix a percentage to be allocated to Mining and Cadastral Office as cost of collection as is currently applicable to NCS (7 percent), DPR (4 percent) and FIRS (4 percent) of non-oil revenue.\n\nOn Unretired Advances involving 39 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the tune of N2,296,567,084.37 billion, the upper chamber demanded the sanctioning of Accounting Officers of MDAs in accordance with the provision of Rule 3124 of Financial Regulations.\n\nIt also call gave the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed

the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to set in motion the process of recovery of Internal Loans made from other Funds which stands at N390,288,085,668.92 billion and to be paid back into the Special Funds Accounts.\n\nNNPC: Kyari\u2019s 2 Years In The Saddle\n\nThe source of the loans are from the Development of Natural Resources Account, Stabilization Fund Account, 25 percent Husked Brown Rice Levy, 1 percent Comprehensive Supervision Scheme (CISS) Pool Levy, 15 percent Wheat Grain Levy, and 10 percent Rice Levy.\n\nIn another vein, the upper chamber directed the

non-remittance of another N67,508,041,250.00 for 2013 and 2014 into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), being 25 percent of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nIt further noted that the failure to remit capitalized interest to the Consolidated Revenue Fund totaling N99,712,464.24 between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn financial infractions by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Senate called for the sanction of the Permanent Secretary in accordance with Rule 3129 of the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules 030402 over the diversion of N23,642,000.00 from the Capital Projects Funds for purchase of Sallah/Christians welfare package to staff of the Ministry.\n\nThe upper chamber queried the sums of N46,645,000.00 and N56,418,135.00 for the printing of the Ministry\u2019s letter-headed paper, and demanded that the sum be recovered and paid back to the treasury.\n\nIt also called for the identification of the Project Accountant who authorized the diversion of N32,783,052.00 meant for IPPIS training and other programmes to bank accounts of staff of Finance and Accounts Department, instead of paying the approved amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nThe Senate demanded the refund of the amount to government coffers, including the sum of N718,911,848.00 made in the cashbook as payments to eleven corporate bodies without documentation.\n\nIn addition, the chamber called on the Ministry to identify and present for disciplinary action, the officers behind the authorization of N98,400,000.00 in favour of a company for printing of leaflets for the Petroleum Industry Bill awareness campaign Programme; N54,000,000.00 to a company for assessment and documentation of Oil Spill sites in ten (10) states of the Niger Delta; and N25,000,000.00 for actualizing e-governance procedure.\n\nThe infractions, the Senate noted, were in

who certified the payment of N37,185,000.00 from the Capital Vote allocation.\n\nIt also directed that N2,695,985.00 be recovered from the emolument of the Director-General of the Small Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), who authorized that the sum be paid to individuals instead of a company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, also demanded the prosecution of the Accounting Officer with SMEDAN who approved the sum of N38,038,238.14 without relevant and supporting documents in contravention to extant laws.\n\nIn meting further disciplinary actions, the chamber

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThe Senate has faulted the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for under remitting the sum of N3.88 trillion revenue from domestic crude oil sales to the Federation Account for the period of January to December, 2015.\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber called on the Corporation to desist from further deduction at source as this contravenes Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nIt also mandated the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) or any other approving authority to, as a matter of urgency, approve agreed percentage which should be allocated to NNPC monthly as operational cost to ensure that their operations are not adversely affected.\n\nThese formed part of the 59 recommendations adopted by the Senate and contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the Annual report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Accounts of the Federation for the years ended 31st December, 2015.\n\nThe Senate in one of its adopted recommendations to the Executive arm of government noted that the outstanding collection from Solid Minerals (N12,137,140,361.58) not remitted to the Federation Account, but kept in an account maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria contravenes the provisions of Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe chamber, therefore, charged the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) to fix a percentage to be allocated to Mining and Cadastral Office as cost of collection as is currently applicable to NCS (7 percent), DPR (4 percent) and FIRS (4 percent) of non-oil revenue.\n\nOn Unretired Advances involving 39 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the tune of N2,296,567,084.37, the upper chamber demanded the sanctioning of Accounting Officers of MDAs in accordance with the provision of Rule 3124 of Financial Regulations.\n\nIt also call gave the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, a deadline of 90 days to identify and sanction officers responsible for mismanagement of public funds to the tune of N54,151,360,000 ($274,280,000.00) as exchange loss on External Loans.\n\nThe Accountant General is expected to report back to the Senate Committee on Public Accounts within ninety days.\n\nIn addition, the Senate gave another 90 days timeline for the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to set in motion the process of recovery of Internal Loans made from other Funds which stands at N390,288,085,668.92 and to be paid back into the Special Funds Accounts.\n\nThe source of the loans are from the Development of Natural Resources Account, Stabilization Fund Account, 25 percent Husked Brown Rice Levy, 1 percent Comprehensive Supervision Scheme (CISS) Pool Levy, 15 percent Wheat Grain Levy, and 10 percent Rice Levy.\n\nIn another vein, the upper chamber directed the Accountant-General of the Federation to recover the sum of N378,879,674.99 tax revenue from Webb Fontaine Ltd and remit same to the Federal Inland Revenue Service within six (6) months.\n\nIt also called for a review of all companies that were paid from the out-flow of one percent CISS Account which amounted to N39,557,671,843.97.\n\nThe upper chamber also directed the Nigerian Posts Authority to refund the sum of $37,627,939.75 (USD) to the federal government coffers due to lack of diligence in the review of NPA\u2019s charges on a contract of Towage services.\n\nIt also mandated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to subject the Accounting Officer to investigation in accordance with Rule 3112 (I and II) of the Financial Regulations.\n\nThe upper chamber also demanded that the Director-General who authorized the disbursement of contingency provision on the contract for the rehabilitation of Lagos Habour moles to the tune of N417,099,309.06 without Federal Executive Council approval to be reported to President Muhammadu Buhari in accordance with Rule 3103 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn other funds diverted by the NPA, the Senate demanded a refund of various sums in local and foreign currencies, consisting of N1,075,266,599.06, $2,301,329.54 (USD), and \u20ac196,257.42 (Euros)meant for the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety and Security (PICOMSS) to the account of the National Security Adviser to the o President, contrary to a directive approved by the Federal Executive Council on February 21, 2007.\n\nIt added that the non-remittance of another N67,508,041,250.00 for 2013 and 2014 into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), being 25 percent of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nIt further noted that the failure to remit capitalized interest to the Consolidated Revenue Fund totaling N99,712,464.24 between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn financial infractions by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Senate called for the sanction of the Permanent Secretary in accordance with Rule 3129 of the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules 030402 over the diversion of N23,642,000.00 from the Capital Projects Funds for purchase of Sallah/Christians welfare package to staff of the Ministry.\n\nThe upper chamber queried the sums of N46,645,000.00 and N56,418,135.00 for the printing of the Ministry\u2019s letter-headed paper, and demanded that the sum be recovered and paid back to the treasury.\n\nIt also called for the identification of the Project Accountant who authorized the diversion of N32,783,052.00 meant for IPPIS training and other programmes to bank accounts of staff of Finance and Accounts Department, instead of paying the approved amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nThe Senate demanded the refund of the amount to government coffers, including the sum of N718,911,848.00 made in the cashbook as payments to eleven corporate bodies without documentation.\n\nIn addition, the chamber called on the Ministry to identify and present for disciplinary action, the officers behind the authorization of N98,400,000.00 in favour of a company for printing of leaflets for the Petroleum Industry Bill awareness campaign Programme; N54,000,000.00 to a company for assessment and documentation of Oil Spill sites in ten (10) states of the Niger Delta; and N25,000,000.00 for actualizing e-governance procedure.\n\nThe infractions, the Senate noted, were in violation of Rule 3117.\n\nThe Senate called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to prosecute within 30 days, the Officers in the Ministry of Youths and Sports (National Sports Commission) who certified the payment of N37,185,000.00 from the Capital Vote allocation.\n\nIt also directed that N2,695,985.00 be recovered from the emolument of the Director-General of the Small Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), who authorized that the sum be paid to individuals instead of a company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, also demanded the prosecution of the Accounting Officer with SMEDAN who approved the sum of N38,038,238.14 without relevant and supporting documents in contravention to extant laws.\n\nIn meting further disciplinary actions, the chamber called on the EFCC to prosecute within thirty days, officers of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (NBET) who were behind the non-remittance of accrued interest on investment in Nigeria Treasury Bills.\n\nIt also sought the prosecution of officers of the National Hospital, Abuja, and the Rural Electrification Agency within the same time frame, who were involved in the diversion of N20,915,998.00 and N14,086,246.00, respectively.\n\nThe Senate requested the Medical Director of the Jos University Teaching Hospital to refund the sum of N26,321,041.01; and the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta to pay back N19,382,047.50 to the Treasury.\n\nAccordingly, while directing the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Abuja, to remit the sums of N3,716,805,388.00, N100,958,369.61, N374,734,768.46 and N161,336,427.80 to the CRF

FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came up on 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\n\u201cThat the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO. FCH/ABJ/CR/383/2015 on that 29th June 2021.\n\n\u201cThat on 30th June 2021, the Applicant\u2019s Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant. A copy of the said letter is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK 1. That on 2nd July 2021, at about 12:32pm, the State Security Service called me to inform me that our request to visit the Applicant has been approved and that I should come by 4:00 pm to see Defendant.\n\n\u201cThat on the said 2nd July 2021 at about 5:00pm, at the State Security Headquarters, in Abuja, the Applicant informed me of the following facts which I verily believed to be accurate and correct as follows; That he was kidnapped and/or abducted by Kenyan Security Forces on 19th June 2021, specifically at Nairobi Airport.\n\n\u201cThat he was detained by the personnel of the Kenyan Police Force for eight days, and was throughout this period of detention subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment, brutal torture, causing grave and severe heart problem that almost took his life. That he was detained in an unconventional facility, not necessarily a police detention center in Kenya.\n\n\u201cThat throughout this detention in Kenya, he was never allowed access to his relatives before he was handed over to their Nigerian Security counterparts who smuggled him into Nigeria in clear violation of his rights. That since he was smuggled into this country on 27th June 2021, he has been kept in solitary confinement without access to his family members, relatives, wife, cousins, and children, except his lawyer, who only visits after they must secure the approval and endorsement of the Director-General of the State Security Service, which approval are not usually granted as a matter of course.\n\n\u201cThat he is still being subjected to mental and psychological torture by his custodians, on account of the conditions of his solitary confinement. That an ECG examination was carried out on the Defendant, and it was discovered that the Defendant\u2019s heart had been enlarged by more than 13%, posing a serious threat and danger to Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat there is a need for the Defendant to have access to his Medical Doctors to avert the danger looming against the life of the Defendant. That the health personnel attending to the Defendant in the custody of the State Security Service is not adequate considering the circumstances of the Defendant\u2019s health condition.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant requires the services of his medical experts as his medical records issued by the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital who has the Defendant\u2019s medical records, mainly, before the arrest/abduction of the Applicant shows a debilitating medical condition. Copies of these medical records showing the Applicant\u2019s subsisting health condition are hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK.\n\n\u201cThat if the health condition of the Defendant is not addressed most promptly, the Defendant may die in custody, even before his trial. It is essential that the Defendant\u2019s Medical Experts/Consultants be allowed to carry out proper, thorough, and independent medical examinations of the Defendant to save the Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant needs regular medical observation/attention by the Defendant\u2019s Medical specialists/Consultants in Cardiology. That the Defendant\u2019s Medical Specialists (including the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital) in Kenya have his complete medical records that will easily aid the examination of the Defendant and treatment thereof.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant undertakes to bear any cost incidental to getting the medical experts to attend to his ill health while in custody. The defendant can only be alive to stand his trial, which cannot be guaranteed because of his rapidly deteriorating health situation.\n\n\u201cThe Defendant cannot effectively put up a defense to the charge against him, in his present deteriorating health condition. That I know that upon the arraignment of the Applicant, this Honourable Court in its wisdom initially remanded the Applicant in Kuje Correctional Service Centre, where he was held for almost two years before bail was consequently granted to the Applicant.\n\n\u201cThat for the almost two years the Applicant was in custody in Kuje Correctional Facility, there was never any complaint about any form of misconduct against him. That the State Security Service is not a detention Centre, neither does it have the requisite custodial facilities to enhance the conditions of the occupants/inmates.\n\n\u201cThat the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre is an impartial facility that has no interest whatsoever in the outcome of this charge. That the Nigerian Correctional Service Center is the only body statutorily empowered to keep custody of persons facing criminal trial in courts, hence, the necessity to transfer the Applicant to the Nigerian Correctional Service Center Kuje.\n\n\u201cThat it will serve the interest of Justice and enhance fair hearing for this Honourable Court to transfer the Applicant from the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat the Applicant has very limited access to his lawyers, who can only visit him after the approval of the Director of the State Security Services has been first sought and obtained, which said approval in most cases, takes days and that the above situation would greatly impede the Defendant\u2019s preparation for his defense to the charge against him.\n\n\u201cThat the favorable consideration of this application is compelling in the circumstance of the present Notice for the resumption of the Court\u2019s Annual vacation, which would affect the hearing on the substantive charge already slated for the 26th Day of July 2021. That fair hearing can only be guaranteed when the Applicant is not remanded in the custody of his accusers.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. That it will greatly aid and serve the interest of Justice if this application is granted. That the respondent will not be prejudiced by the grant of this application. That I depose to this affidavit in good faith believing same to be true and correct and in accordance with the oath Act.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.",

          "text": "The Nigerian political arena is currently agog with declarations and bids of many political heavyweights to succeed the incumbent President Mohammadu Buhari who will step aside in 2023 after his mandatory eight years in office. While some of the candidates are operating lip service structures, His Excellency Owelle Rochas Ethelbert Anayo Okorocha, a distinguished senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, already has a formidable structure that is making a strong impact in the six geo-political zones.\n\nThat is why his office, the Nigerian Unity House, is currently besieged by multifarious groups to endorse the presidential ambition of the Ogboko born charismatic politician. For the past two months, the unity house has become one of the busiest centers in Abuja with courtesy calls from not less than 1000 different groups from Owelle\u2019s beloved North West, North East, North Central, South West, South-South, and his indigenous South East.\n\nAll the various groups came with one swan- song, that Owelle stands the best chance to emerge victorious in 2023and extend his RESCUE MISSION mantra to Nigeria. In fact, one of the enthusiastic groups, the Nigerian Youths Alternative Council threatened to initiate litigations against Owelle if he does do not respond to their clarion call to officially declare for the presidency. Moreover, the mothers and other female groups were not left out. Recently, the Omalicha Umuadalgbo worldwide equally visited to extol his good dreams for New Nigeria that will actualize the gender balance for marginalized female folks.\n\nAs charity begins at home, his kinsmen from Umuma Ebemmano clan made up of 14 large communities in ldeato south LGA Imo state stormed the unity house to endorse and encourage the pride of their clan that the coast is clear for him to emerge as next president of Nigeria in 2023. During the courtesy call, their leader, Engr Jude Anayo Ibe thanked Owelle for his dynamic leadership and rescue mission in lmo state. Another respected royal father and elder from the community.\n\nHRH Ichie Uche Chineke. Chairman Eze lgbo Traditional Council FCTnot only prayed for God\u2019s grace to Owelle but crowned the courtesy visit with the presentation of a unique Igbosymbolicwalking stickof authoritythat will banish all unforeseen ugly forces that might stand as the Rock of Gibraltar against Owelle\u2019s march to Aso rock. The community women leader, Lolo Charity Ego Duru assured that their prayers will send a legion of Anges to protect and lead Owelle to the promised land. The question remains. Why are so many groups from the Nigerian six geo-political zones drumming support for Owelle Rochas? The answer lies simply in his detribalized credentials, religious piety, transparency, and philanthropism which have transformed the wellbeing of people in all parts of Nigeria.\n\nIn fact, there is no Nigerian geo-political zone that has not benefited from Rochas Foundation Colleges and multifarious investments in the 36 states of the federation. As messianic Governor of Imo state, his 8 years rescue mission moved the heartland state to the next level via ecumenical center, 27 standard hospitals, new government house, free education, school buildings in all the wards, universities, cargo airport, stadiums, palm revolution, best judicial infrastructure, community watch, civil guard and intra city road networks. Just like many Imo communities, his beloved Umuma Ebemmano clan was equally turned into a mini-city with universities, road networks, widows houses, youth vehicles, hospitals, modern schools, boreholes, etc.\n\nToday, with the numerous visitations and endorsement from Nigerians at his unity house, the coast is clear for Owelle to emerge as Nigerian President in 2023. His wealth of experience and leadership acumen in the political, religious academic, cultural, economic, and social realm will not only put the nation on strong footing but lead to the actualization of New Nigerian manifest destiny as a true giant of Africa and leader of the black world.\n\nLong live Excellency Owelle Rochas Ehelbert Anayo Okorocha, Nigerian detribalized servant leader with the Midas touch to take Nigeria to the NEXT level as President in 2023.\n\n\u2026 Chief Duruis is an Abuja based political analyst and policy advocate",

          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, with star accepting a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay, ESPN reports.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500 million over four years and that expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1 billion. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on August 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nThe report claims that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi in April that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",
