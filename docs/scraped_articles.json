We won well in 2015 and in 2019, and in 2023 we will finish work again.\n\n\u201cWe are advising those who want to run in other political parties not to waste their time and money because there is no space for them in Delta\u201d.\n\nOkowa remarked that his administration had done quite a lot since inception, explaining that he had appointed many youths into government and that never in the history of the state had youths been so appointed into various offices in the state.\n\n\u201cNever in the history of this state have youths been so empowered through our various empowerment and entrepreneurship programmes.\n\n\u201cWe have done well for our women and we will continue to do more for them, and let me make it clear that even as we play politics, we will continue to do the work that you asked us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nOn infrastructure, the governor assured Deltans that his administration would not slow down in constructing more roads, saying \u201cuntil I leave office in May, 2023, we will continue to build more and more roads and for those who haven\u2019t been to Asaba in recent times, when you see our new State Secretariat you will be proud that you are a Deltan.\n\n\u201cAll our achievements are the collective efforts of all Deltans because you gave us the peace to work and we can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d\n\nHe advised aspirants to control their followers, noting that there was no need for any fight as the party remained one big united family.\n\n\u201cWe are one family in PDP; we cannot fight and we will never fight; at the appropriate time, it will be well with us.\n\n\u201cBut, one thing I have always promised and I still promise today is that there will always be free and fair primaries; so, there is no room to fight.\n\n\u201cThere is no room to quarrel, let us work together as one family that we are and ensure that PDP stays continuously as a family,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn his address, former Governor of the state, Chief James Ibori, lauded Governor Okowa for his leadership of the state and the party, and declared that he would continue to support him to succeed beyond his tenure as governor of the state.\n\n\u201cI thank you for the job you are doing in Delta and at the national level for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI most especially thank you for what I am seeing here today because you have done very well in Delta State and I cannot be more proud that you are our governor today.\n\n\u201cYou are leading us very well and it is our duty, and we are all committed to say that you will finish very strong and at the end of the day we will all gather to thank God for you.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can see here you have provided an atmosphere for a free and fair contest and you have provided an atmosphere for people\u2019s aspirations to be heard without intimidation whatsoever.\n\n\u201cOf a truth, this was the philosophy behind the formation of this great party when I said in 1998 that democracy is about opening up the space and environment for everybody to aspire to whatever he or she believes in and I thank you for continuing with that vision.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you on behalf of teeming members of our party and pray that God will continue to guide you as you lead us in the years ahead,\u2019\u2019 Ibori said.\n\nHe added that he personally didn\u2019t \u201cbelieve that your leadership will terminate at the end of your tenure as governor; I don\u2019t believe that.\n\n\u201cI have come to say that you have earned your strides and your strides will continue to carry you on by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of my one vote, my unit in Ogharefe, Ethiope West Local Government Area, I want to commit and dedicate myself to the service of PDP Delta State and Nigeria at large\u201d.\n\nWelcoming defectors to the party earlier, Chairman of PDP in the state, Chief Kingsley Esiso, said that the rally was primarily organised to welcome decampees from APC and other political parties.\n\nEsiso said that the massive exodus from APC was a testimony that the party has failed Nigerians in all ramifications.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the primary purpose of this rally is to reduce the opposition party in Delta State by 90 per cent.\n\n\u201cMy heart is full of joy and a testimony that APC is a failed political party and the people of Delta have come to realise that APC has only come to bring us economic hardship, poverty, banditry, kidnapping and failed promises.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore not a surprise that every reasonable member of the APC is jumping ship to join us.\n\n\u201cToday, we are harvesting many of their leaders from different local government areas and we are celebrating this victory for our great party,\u201d he said.\n\nOther leaders who spoke at the rally included, Deputy Governor, Mr Kingsley Otuaro, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Chief Ndudi Elumelu, Senator James Manager and former Senate Chief Whip, Senator Stella Omu.\n\nThe defectors to the PDP, who were in large number and led by former Chairman of APC in the state, Chief Cyril Ogodo, pledged to work for the PDP to ensure that APC was no more in the state.",

As always when I am talking about late Abiola, I still thank God for directing me on things to do when he gave me the leadership of this country.\u201d\n\nHe stated that \u201con the day Moshood Abiola passed away, may he rest in peace, two to three things made him always say he thanked God for the guidance He gave him, adding that he received a delegation from America headed by Pickering who was then the secretary of state or so and the team was Susan Rice.\u201d\n\nHe added that after the normal courtesy and discussion they had, when they were leaving his office, Pickering said, \u201cYour Excellency we made a request to see Moshood Abiola but we were denied\u201d, so I said \u201cWhy were you denied? who denied you?\u201d There and then I made a decision, I said \u201cLook, you will see Moshood definitely, I overruled whoever said you cannot see him\u201d.

And that day, I vowed that I will no longer be a member of any political party.\n\n\u201cI will remain a statesman in Nigeria, West Africa, Africa and indeed in the world at large.\n\n\u201cThough, I have retired from partisan politics, but I cannot retire from the welfare and wellbeing of the people, whether in my own community, in my own state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nObasanjo said that the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, has a huge responsibility in restoring the lost glory of the party, praying that God would grant him the wisdom to succeed.\n\nIn his remarks, Ayu said he considered it appropriate to visit Obasanjo with the party chieftains so that they could learn from his wealth of experiences.\n\nThe PDP chairman said that the tenure of Obasanjo as Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the PDP, remained the golden era of the party.\n\n\u201cDuring that period, not only did you grow Nigeria\u2019s economy to be the biggest in Africa,\n\nyou were able to take the country away from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of its foreign debts.\n\n\u201cThe Direct Foreign Investment (FDI) in the country was on the increase on daily basis with attendant respect for Nigeria from the international community.\n\nRead Also: JUST IN: PDP NWC meets Obasanjo over 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the institutions and agencies set up during your tenure, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), are still useful in the country.\n\n\u201cYou are very passionate about this country and you did a lot. So, we thought we should come and thank you for what you have done, not just for Nigerians, but also for our party and the African continent.\n\n\u201cI think today, in all modesty, after the departure of late President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, there remains only one person of such stature on the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that the person is a Nigerian in the person of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nAyu, who described Obasanjo as a de-tribised leader, recalled that the elder statesman once told him that he (Obasanjo), would feel diminished, if anyone limits him to a particular tribe, rather than Nigeria as a country.\n\nHe explained that the thought had stuck in his head that he, and every Nigerian, has the responsibility to keep Nigeria united and take it to an enviable height.\n\n\u201cThough, you retired from partisan politics, partisan politics will never retire from your blood.\n\n\u201cYou always want the right thing done and since you want the right thing done, for life, you will remain the emeritus member of the PDP.\n\n\u201cYou cannot build a house and leave it to collapse.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to contribute our own quotas to the growth of the party and the nation and we will continue to come to you.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to plead with you, please don\u2019t be tired of us as we come knocking, asking for your advice and wisdom because the words of elders are the words of wisdom,\u201d he said.(NAN)",

          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor/Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta\n\nPlot indirect primaries to pick party\u2019s flagbearer\n\nObasanjo to NWC members: I\u2019ll never return to your party\n\nThe presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in next year\u2019s election may emerge from the ranks of the party\u2019s 13 state governors as they fine tune their strategy for the polls.\n\nThe governors, during preliminary discussions on the matter, have agreed in principle to ensure that one of them flies the party\u2019s flag during the election.\n\nNewly elected national chairman of the PDP, Prof. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday led other chieftains of the party to Abeokuta to confer with former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDetails of their closed door meeting were not immediately known, but Obasanjo told the delegation after their talks that he was not interested in returning to the party come what may.\n\nAyu had told him not to be \u201ctired of us as we come knocking asking for advice. \u201c\n\nInvestigation by The Nation revealed that the governors are determined to consolidate on their success at the recent national convention of the party where their favoured candidates emerged as members of the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nTo achieve their objective of producing the presidential candidate, the governors, party sources said, have also resolved to encourage the party leadership to adopt the indirect mode of primary election to nominate the presidential candidate later in the year.\n\nThis, it was learnt, is part of a grand plan to prevent other presidential aspirants, especially former Vice President Abubakar Atiku, from getting the presidential ticket.\n\nA PDP senator said the governors are banking on their current hold on the leadership of the party to achieve their aim.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAt the just-concluded national elective convention of the PDP in Abuja, majority of the governors elected on the platform of our party, working together, showed their might as they literally hand-picked members of the next National Working Committee (NWC) and other national officers of the party.\n\n\u201cThough a couple of governors appeared left out of the arrangement back then, it appears they have now been appeased as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has taken firm charge of the party, and is in a vintage position to decide who will fly the party\u2019s presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cAttempts by other stakeholders in the party including former Vice-President Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki and former Jigawa State Governor Sule Lamido, to wrest control of the party from the governors were unsuccessful as seen in their attempt to install Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola (rtd) as Deputy National Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cThe governors muscled Taofeek Arapaja into the position with their collective influence and delegates. This is a foretaste of what awaits us all when the contest for the presidential ticket of the PDP finally takes off.\u201d\n\nA member of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) corroborated the view, saying the governors made it clear during the crisis ridden days of the party\u2019s former NEC that they were left with no choice than to take over the leadership of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThey are not pretending about what they intend to do,\u201d our source who pleaded anonymity said.\n\n\u201cDuring the discussions to decide who would lead the party after Secondus, several interests and caucuses attempted to take charge.\n\n\u201cThe governors, presidential aspirants, party elders and the National Assembly caucuses; they all struggled for control. But the governors had their way eventually largely because of their number and privileged positions.\n\n\u201cAnd from day one, nobody was left in doubt about their plans.\n\n\u201cRecently, at a meeting with some BoT members in Abuja, a couple of governors revealed that what is best for PDP in 2023 is for the party to repeat its 2007 model when two governors emerged as presidential candidate and running mate.\n\n\u201cTheir argument is that the party needs funds and widespread mobilization for its campaign, and it is only a group like the Governors\u2019 Forum that can marshal such funding and mobilization in the current circumstance.\u201d\n\nThe Nation further gathered that the governors are convinced that only a concerted effort on the part of the group can stop the plan by Atiku to pick the PDP ticket again.\n\nSources said Governor Duoye Diri of Bayelsa and Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa, who were initially not part of the plot executed by their colleagues to take over the party last December, were reconciled to the larger house shortly before and after the convention respectively as part of efforts to ensure unanimity in the actions of the governors going forward.\n\n\u201cPDP governors are all on the same page on these issues as we speak. They are working together,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nA zonal Vice Chairman of the party in the immediate past NWC told our correspondent in confidence that with the outcome of the last elective convention, the governors have announced themselves as the undisputed owners of the party.\n\n\u201cPresidential aspirants of the party, including Anyim, Atiku, Lamido, Kwankwaso and Saraki, already know what they are in for. They know the governors would have a big say in the 2023 presidential contest.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that without the support of the governors, you can\u2019t win a big position in the PDP of today. This is the message I think everyone took home from that convention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge among leaders of the party that the governors are working in that direction since after the convention.\n\n\u201cAnd one of the plans is to foist indirect mode of primary election on the party for the nomination of the presidential flag-bearer.\n\n\u201cThe talks are already on and the leadership of the party that will decide is firmly under the control of the governors.\n\n\u201cBut if you ask me, I will say there is nothing wrong in what they are doing because we are all politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered that the governors are trying to convert more party members to support their plot.\n\nAt one of their meetings, it was resolved that governors would move against any consideration of direct primary by the PDP.\n\nTo achieve this, members were asked to sensitise NASS members in their various states and get their support for the plot.\n\n\u201cAlready, members of the NWC from all the states controlled by the governors are in their kitty and will readily agree to the dictates of the governors.\n\n\u201cThe challenges they have now are in states not governed by the PDP.\n\n\u201cTo overcome this challenge, they plan to use the zonal leadership of the party to control these states. That explains the fierce political wars in some zones over party positions.\n\n\u201cThe Southwest, North-central and the South-south are good examples.\n\n\u201cWhile the governors can confidently boast of pulling their plot through in the 13 PDP-controlled states, they are working hard to penetrate the other states where they don\u2019t have one of their own in charge.\n\n\u201cThese states are the hopes of Atiku and others. But if the governors go into the race united and the other aspirants split the available states, you can guess what will happen.\u201d\n\nObasanjo to Ayu, others: I\u2019ll never return to your party\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday told the Iyorchia Ayu-led PDP delegation that visited him in Abeokuta that he was through with partisan politics and nothing would take him back to the PDP.\n\nBut he said the party would remain part of his history, having been president on its ticket twice.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been with the party right from inception. Whatever I do in my own life, because I became president on the platform PDP, PDP will continue to be part of the history of my life.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, the day that my ward decided to tear my PDP card was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP, and that day, I vowed that I would not be a member of any political party again. But I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, in West Africa, in Africa and indeed in the world.\n\n\u201cI retired 14 years ago and I remain retired by the grace of God. But if I retired from partisan politics, if politics is welfare of the people, I must not retire from the welfare and wellbeing of the people whether in my own community, in my own state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasise that I\u2019m no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that will bring me back to partisan politics. But I will always be interested in what is good for Nigeria, and anybody who wants to have my advice, I will give it in the best interest of Nigeria and in the best interest of Africa.\u201d\n\nHe prayed that God might help Ayu \u201ccarry the load placed on his shoulder\u201d by virtue of his position as PDP national chairman.\n\nPDP will restore Nigeria\u2019s glory \u2014Ayu\n\nAyu, in his remarks, said the PDP would restore Nigeria\u2019s glory if it wins next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHe regretted what he called the huge debts accumulated by the Buhari administration, saying the debt profile would subject generations unborn to servitude.\n\nHe hailed Obasanjo for treating all Nigerians as equal during his tenure.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver these years that you were in power, you saw every Nigerian as one family; you didn\u2019t discriminate against the South, the East, the West or the North.\n\n\u201cEven though in your first tenure the South West didn\u2019t actually support you, you brought them back on board and they supported you in your second tenure and that was an achievement.\n\n\u201cAs the first president in this Republic, your period as president on the platform of PDP is seen as the golden era of the PDP and Nigeria, because not only did you lay the foundation to grow the economy to become the biggest economy in Africa, you were able to remove Nigeria from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of our foreign debts that would have made it very difficult to run the country.\n\n\u201cBy the time you left office, Nigeria was totally set free. Direct foreign investment was on the increase on a daily basis and we were respected in international community and everywhere we went.\n\nThose on the visit included former governor of Anambra State, Dr. Peter Obi; former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; National Secretary of PDP, Senator Sam Anyanwu; Deputy National Chairman, South, Amb.

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nActress cum filmmaker, Njideka George is so confident about her plus-size body and not ready to comprise on that.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, the thespian cum entrepreneur opens up on her struggles as a plus-size actress, acting nude as well as reasons behind her lack of interest in marriage. Please enjoy it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your special birthday wish for this year?\n\nIf I tell you, it wouldn\u2019t come true.\n\nNow, what are you mainly happy for?\n\nI have so much to be happy for. But my first choice would be that I\u2019m happy for the support I get from my family, especially my mum. I\u2019ve always had their support. Like I said, it\u2019s been a tough year but their support has made it easier. They take my business like it\u2019s theirs. I\u2019m truly thankful.\n\nBetween marriage, having kids, cars and houses, what are the goals you wish to see accomplished before your 24th birthday?\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not thinking about marriage or kids. If the right man comes and it\u2019s God\u2019s will, then I\u2019ll gladly get married. But it isn\u2019t on my priority list for now. I have a business I run, a plus-size fashion line called, Dekas Place. I\u2019m also a plus-size model and an actor/producer. All I\u2019m focused on right now is the expansion of me as a brand, and the expansion of my business. Once I achieve this, I\u2019m confident that cars and houses would be peanuts for me.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind Dekas Place?\n\nDekas Place is actually a representation of who I am. The first thing to know about me is that I\u2019m a plus-size advocate and a body positivity enthusiast. I\u2019m really passionate about plus-size women loving their bodies. Before I started Dekas Place, I would always search for dresses my size and wouldn\u2019t see any. I didn\u2019t want plus-size women to keep going through that. I wanted them to know that being sexy or confident is a choice; it\u2019s a decision. I wanted them to feel good about themselves. I wanted them to feel appreciated. I wanted to create a space where they\u2019d shop without having to think if they would get their size or not. I want plus-size women to be bold and beautiful.\n\nCan you tell us about your journey as a filmmaker and some of the movies you\u2019ve produced?\n\nI produced my first movie last year; it\u2019s a feature length movie called, Lost in the Act. It features top stars like Esther Audu Ojire, Anthony Monjaro, Ngozi Ezeh Evuka, Righteous King, and myself, Deka George among others. Indeed, it has been a tough journey, and filmmakers deserve more credits.\n\nPlus-size women are confidently taking over, what motivates you guys?\n\nI know the struggle that comes with truly loving yourself. I have been there. It\u2019s a dark place; I never want to go back. I don\u2019t want any fat, orobo, thick or plus-size woman to ever feel bullied.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHow do you deal with body-shaming on social media or physically?\n\nI know who I am and I\u2019m not ashamed of what my body looks like. I love myself too much to be sad about another person\u2019s opinion. I know I\u2019m fat, so you calling me fat or telling me about my folds isn\u2019t going to make me sad. These are things I\u2019m very aware of. I give myself daily affirmations; I block people a lot. I ignore people a lot too. It really depends on my mood.\n\nDo you also sell inner wears as most plus-size women hardly find their accurate sizes, especially bra?\n\nRemember I talked about expansion; this is part of what I meant. I sell lingerie for now. They help boost confidence as well.\n\nTo give you a change of look, would you consider liposuction someday?\n\nI\u2019ve always been big, I don\u2019t know how else to look. I\u2019ve looked this way for 23 years and I love me. I\u2019m not against liposuction and if I ever consider it, I\u2019ll do so with my full chest.\n\nWhat is the most priceless part of your body?\n\nMy whole body is priceless to me; I have grown to love every part of me. I mean every fold, every curve and every single part of me.\n\nWould you say your sexual appeal has opened doors for you?\n\nI would say hard work and God\u2019s grace has brought me this far.\n\nWhat\u2019s the craziest thing a fan has done to you?\n\nI\u2019ve had men send me nude pictures.\n\nCan you act nude?\n\nMaybe (I can act) semi nude, but completely nude is a no for me at this point in my life.",

          "title": "Nothing will Bring Me Back to Partisan Politics, Obasanjo Tells PDP Leaders",
          "text": "*Buhari\u2019s administration clueless, piling eternal debts, says Ayu\n\nJames Sowole\n\n\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday restated his vow not to return to partisan politics.\n\nObasanjo, 84, made this known when a delegation of the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, visited him at his residence in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nThis is coming as Ayu has described the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration as a clueless government that is piling eternal debts for future generations.\n\nThe PDP delegation during the meeting, held behind closed doors, dwelt extensively on the party\u2019s search for a suitable presidential candidate, who will wrestle power from the APC.\n\nThe National Secretary of the party, Senator Sam Anyanwu; the Deputy National Chairman, South and former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Mr Taofeek Arapaja; other members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the PDP vice presidential candidate in 2019 elections, Mr, Peter Obi, were part of the delegation.\n\nThe delegation also include a former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; a former governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and two former governors of Cross River State, Mr. Donald Duke, Senator Liyel Imoke; former Police Affairs Minister, Adamu Waziri, and former Minister of Special Duties, Tanimu Kabiru Turaki (SAN), were also among the PDP chieftains in attendance.\n\nA source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that the PDP leaders sought Obasanjo\u2019s contribution to the issue of zoning and the search for a formidable presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe visit was part of the wider consultations embarked upon by the PDP to strategise for the 2023 general election, especially the presidential election. They had fruitful discussions on the issue of zoning and the need to search for a suitable and credible presidential candidate,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, after the closed-door meeting, Obasanjo publicly told his guests to bear in mind that he was no longer in partisan politics.\n\nRecall that the former president had some years ago publicly announced that he was quitting politics, and tearing his PDP membership card in his house in Abeokuta.\n\nBut speaking yesterday, Obasanjo said: \u201cI have been with the party right from inception. Whatever I do in my own life, because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of the history of my life.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, the day that in my ward I decided to tear my PDP card was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP and that day I vowed that I will not be a member of any political party again, but I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, in West Africa, in Africa and indeed in the world.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who said the responsibilities on the shoulder of Ayu, were enormous, prayed that he would be able to carry them.\n\n\u201cYour case is like the case of Idi Amin of Uganda. Idi Amin came to me and he said \u2018my brother, you have Africa load and it is on your shoulder, I pray God will help you carry Africa load\u2019.\n\n\u201cIyorchia, you have PDP load with Nigeria load and it is only God that can help you to carry this load, which of course, I believe if God gives you a responsibility, He will also give you the wherewithal to be able to carry that responsibility.\n\n\u201cIn my hope, which is also some people\u2019s disappointment is that some of you who knew how things were done 21 years ago are still there but then some people will say here if you knew how it was done 21 years ago why have you not consistently be doing it? I think you can answer that, I will not answer for you, but if you ask me, I retired 14 years ago and I remain retired and I will remain retired by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cBut if I retired from partisan politics if politics is the welfare of the people, I must not retire from the welfare and well-being of people whether in my community, in my state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world and that is why I have the type of responsibility that I now have in the horn of Africa, which is not an easy responsibility, but it has to be done. But I will say that your responsibility is not an easy one either, but it has to be done.\n\n\u201cBut bear in mind and I want to emphasise that I\u2019m no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that will bring me back to partisan politics, but I will always be interested in what is good for Nigeria and anybody who wants to have my advice, I will give it in the best interest of Nigeria and the best interest of Africa,\u201d Obasanjo explained.\n\nResponding, Ayu commended Obasanjo for what he did when he was Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nHe described the President Muhammadu Buhari administration as clueless and piling eternal debts for this and future generations.\n\nAyu also described the present administration as wicked, pointing out that only a wicked regime would subject generations unborn to the servitude of slavery.\n\nNot done, the National Chairman blamed Buhari for the low in Nigeria\u2019s international reputation as an insecure country and the poverty capital of the world, a reversal of fortunes which he measured, were the direct opposite of the achievements of Obasanjo of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the service you rendered and the great work you have done in the PDP as the first president.\n\n\u201cYour period as president under the platform of PDP was seen as the golden era of the PDP because not only did you grow the economy to be the biggest economy in Africa, you were able to eradicate Nigeria from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of our foreign debts that would have made it very difficult to run the country.\n\n\u201cBy the time you left office, Nigeria was set free, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was on the increase daily; we were respected in the international community, everywhere we went.\n\n\u201cI remember I accompanied you as your minister to some countries \u2013 Germany, Indian \u2013 I saw the respect they accorded you in India and I was very proud to be a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cToday, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the same recognition because what we have has fallen short of the leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cApart from the infrastructural intervention, which you did, most of the institutions, some of them are today useful\u2026 like EFCC, the ICPC and so on you- put it in place.\n\n\u201cI remember when you took some of us to Germany to the offices or the Transparency International and we had a very useful discussion there. So, you are very passionate about this country and you did a lot and we thought we should come and thank you for what you have done not to just Nigerians but our party and Africa.\n\n\u201cOver these years that you were in power, you saw every Nigerian as one family, you didn\u2019t discriminate against the South, the East, the West or the North. Even though in your first tenure, the South-west didn\u2019t actually support you, but you brought them back on board and they supported you in your second tenure,\u201d Ayu explained.\n\n\u201cIn Africa today, I think today, in all modesty, after the departure of President Mandela, there is only one person of such stature on the African continent and we are proud that that person is a Nigerian and that Nigerian is no other than President Olusegun Obasanjo and you have continued to display the leadership because it is wrong to address you as Nigerian leader or Yoruba leader or an Owu chief.\n\n\u201cEven though you retired from partisan politics, partisan politics will never retire from your blood, because you want the right thing done and since you want the right thing done, for the life you will remain the emeritus member of the PDP. You cannot build a house and leave it to collapse,\u201d Ayu told Obasanjo.\n\nHe promised the former president that the PDP would restore Nigeria\u2019s lost glory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nAs the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) begins its first meeting for the year 2022, in Abuja tomorrow, economic analysts have advised against hike in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) despite the mounting pressure on the apex bank to announce a higher rate.\n\nMPR was retained at 11.5 per cent at its September 2021 meeting.\n\nMPR is the interest rate at which CBN lends to the commercial banks. The MPR is the benchmark against which other lending rates in the economy are pegged and is usually used as an instrument to moderate inflation in the economy.\n\nIn their forecast of the outcome of the MPC meeting, analysts from Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Cordros Capital Limited and Cowry Asset Management Company Limited, in separate reports, released last week, believed that the current pressure on the CBN is not enough to cause an upset in the nation\u2019s interest rate regime.\n\nAccording to them, issues putting pressure on the MPC to increase benchmark rate include an upward inflationary pressure amid the anticipation of subsidy removal, increasing electricity tariff, foreign exchange volatility and the intending rate hike by Federal Reserve in 2022.\n\nThe pressure was fueled by the latest headline inflation figure, which broke away from the eight-month declining trend to rise by 0.23 per cent to 15.63 per cent from 15.4 per cent in November 2021.\n\nThis increase in inflation figure, according to the report by Financial Derivatives Company, now increases the probability of a rate hike, even though it is highly unlikely this time. The CBN had maintained the status quo 25 times in the last 28 meetings.\n\nThe report did not rule out further increases in domestic inflation in the coming months.\n\nIt however insisted that the monetary policy committee may not yield to the temptation of tampering with the current rate.\n\n\u201cWe expect domestic inflation to increase further in the coming months due to the imminent removal of petrol subsidy and the planting season effect amongst other factors. This increases the chances of a tighter monetary policy stance although it is highly unlikely at this time,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn their report, analysts from Cordros Capital said despite the reality of the current inflationary trends, the CBN may prefer to exercise some restraints to allow previous policy actions to permeate the economy instead of falling to the temptation to raise interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe uptick in headline inflation in December (2021) will likely stir up a debate among Committee members about whether it is a blip or a trend that will persist in the coming months.\n\nFor us, the significance of this meeting is primarily predicated on the body language of the Committee regarding the timing of the shift to a hawkish monetary stance. Like the November meeting in the prior year, we expect the Committee to affirm its view on monitoring the policy actions of global central banks before commencing its tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cGiven the negative output gap and sub-optimal PMI readings, our baseline, the expectation is that the MPC will judge the need to allow previous policy actions to permeate the economy.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Committee is likely to assess that tightening at this meeting will be \u201ctoo early\u201d and counterproductive. Thus, we expect the MPC to maintain the status quo on all monetary policy parameters. However, we expect the Committee to strike a hawkish tone in light of the gradual tightening in global financing conditions even as inflation remains above the CBN\u2019s medium-term target of six per cent to nine per cent.\u201d\n\nThe report called for the sustenance of the growth momentum as the impact of the favourable base from the prior year dissipates. \u201cAs a result, we project the economy would grow by 2.44 per cent y/y and 2.10 per cent y/y in Q4-21 and Q1-22, respectively. Accordingly, we expect the committee to reiterate the need for CBN to maintain its current interventions to sustain the recovery of output growth, more so that the PMI readings remain sub-optimal. Therefore, we believe the fragile recovery process would induce the committee to maintain its dovish stance,\u201d the report stated, adding that the committee will feel the committee needs to maintain its monetary policy stance to allow its interventions to continue to support improvement in aggregate food supply and, by extension, drive down prices.\u201d\n\nDismissing the possibility of a raise hike, analysts from Cowry Research note that an increase in MPR would hamper economic growth.\n\n\u201cOur expectation on retention of policy rate centres more on the fact that Nigeria\u2019s inflationary pressure is chiefly cost-push, which would be aggravated if the cost of funding goes higher again \u2013 especially for the manufacturers who would pass on the additional cost to their customers. We believe that the monetary policymaker would see pre-election aggravated demand-pull inflationary pressure as transient. Hence, we anticipate an upward trend in stop rates and yields on debt securities, to retain investment in Naira, denominated assets,\u201d the report from Cowry Asset Management stated.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the committee in September 2021 unanimously voted to maintain the key lending rate at 11.5 per cent, with the asymmetric corridor of +100 and -700 basis points around the MPR. The CBN MPC noted that holding stance would allow current recovery in output and decline inflation continue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

As you know, he is a serving governor, the Executive Governor of Yobe State and comfortably piloting the affairs of the state.\n\n\u201cHe is just the chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the party. As you said, there are so many rumours.\n\n\u201cBut l want to assure you that Governor Buni has not discussed with anyone that he is contesting any position.\n\n\u201cHe has neither confided in nor asked someone to work for him for the aspiration of any office. That he is scheming or lobbying or aspiring for the party\u2019s office is false, unfounded and baseless.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary of the committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe described the report as untrue.\n\nHe said the media is trying to create content that has been misleading Nigeria and keep saying things that are not true.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cYou wanted a convention; we have set a date for our convention; you are coming with another story. That I simply say that it is not true.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential Adviser on Political Matters, Ojudu, has saluted the national secretariat of the ruling party for embracing direct primary for Ekiti governorship primary, saying this will help in dousing the tension and return calmness after the internal poll.\n\nHe, however, advised the Buni-led National Caretaker executive of the APC to conduct a free, fair and credible primary that can produce a formidable candidate for the June 18 governorship election in the state.\n\nThe presidential aide said this in Ado Ekiti yesterday during an interaction with journalists on the January 27 APC primary to elect its flagbearer.\n\nHe averred that the only way the APC can be proud of itself as a ruling party and win the June 18 election with ease, is to conduct a credible primary that is devoid of violence, venom and bloodshed.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to party men to be civil and peaceful. The only glory we can record in our party is to be peaceful and for our leaders from Abuja to conduct a primary we can all be proud of. Don\u2019t let us be violent just because of the internal election.\n\n\u201cPrimary of any party should be a day of celebration of democracy and not a day of bloodshed. We should be able to do this election without rancour. I am of that belief that politicians, who want to use money to hire thugs to win the election should rather use such money for the development of our unemployed youth.\n\n\u201cOur party officials should be fair and transparent. They should also be efficient with the process.\n\n\u201cI commend Governor Buni-led executive for allowing direct primary for this election, so that every member of the party, either rich or poor, high or low can participate. This will enable us to produce a candidate that can face the candidates of other parties.\n\n\u201cIf by any means we impose someone or throw up someone who used money to induce the people, or relying on federal might, we will have a candidate that cannot win or that wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to the party people.\n\n\u201cLet me clarify that this government of President Buhari doesn\u2019t believe in using federal might to win elections, you have to go through the people to get votes.\u201d\n\nOjudu warned party members to resist vote buying temptation for APC to have a credible and formidable candidate that will be acceptable to all.\n\n\u201cThe aspirants shouldn\u2019t bring thugs to bash and beat the people. Whoever is causing trouble should be exposed, because Ekiti must be in peace. All of us in APC must be able to come together and work to win in June. This is one election that we can\u2019t afford to lose\u201d.\n\nThe presidential aide told the security agencies to maintain neutrality and owe their allegiance to the constitution of the party, rather than individuals.\n\nOn the aspirant he is backing in APC for the primary, Ojudu said: \u201cFor now, I am not in support of anybody. I want to remain neutral so that I will be able to call all aspirants together and settle their differences after the primary.\n\n\u201cLosing an election is hurting, so we need an arbiter to be able to hold the party together and that is the role I intend to play.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari lost election three times. Nobody thought he would ever be president again, but when the time God assigned to him came, he won and it was glorious for him. There is no point in bringing guns to win elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Others are saying no decision had been reached and want zoning jettisoned.\n\nOn the flip side, except the unforeseen happens, the Chairman of the CECPC, who is also governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is scheming to be on the chairmanship ballot paper when the party converges on Abuja February 26, to elect new National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC had consistently resisted pressure to hold the elective National Convention, with a plan to sit tight and conduct the party\u2019s primaries for the 2023 elections, but recent push from President Muhammadu Buhari forced it to bend backwards, resulting in the announced convention date.\n\nAspirants from outside the North-central, where the National Chairman\u2019s position is rumoured to have been zoned, are anxious for a quick official position from CECPC on the issue, to know whether to halt the time and resources being expended on their campaigns or not.\n\nAlso, by yesterday, some chairmanship aspirants from the North-central were insisting that the party\u2019s stakeholders had all agreed that the position of Chairman be zoned to the region and that the CECPC should just do the needful by making a formal announcement.\n\nOne of the chairmanship aspirants from the zone and the Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, yesterday insisted that the party had zoned the chairmanship to North-central and commended the party\u2019s leadership for doing so.\n\nAkume, who spoke in Abuja through Simone Shango, the Chairman, Contact Committee of his Campaign Organisation, said it was normal for the party to \u201cdeny the zoning arrangement at this point, but a formal announcement would be made soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former Governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, who is also a chairmanship aspirant, described the claim that the position had been zoned to North-central as fake news, adding that other aspirants are afraid of going into the convention with him.\n\nSheriff insisted that he was the target of the rumoured zoning of the position to the North-central, saying he remained the candidate to beat.\n\nHe is of the view that anyone can be chairman \u201cbut not everybody has the capacity to be the chairman.\u201d\n\nAnother chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said while it still remained \u201ca rumour\u201d that the APC chairmanship had been zoned to North-central, it was still in line with his expectation.\n\nMustapha who spoke through his media aide, Dapo Okunbanjo said he remained the frontrunner for the number one party position.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for this zoning, we\u2019ve heard this but we still consider it a rumour just like what the CECPC said. And if indeed it\u2019s zoned officially to North-central, it will be in line with our expectations. We still see ourselves as frontrunners in the race whether it\u2019s zoned or not, but what we are doing is to take things one step at a time.\u201d\n\nThe source that leaked Buni\u2019s move to THISDAY last night, added that the need to perfect the Yobe State governor\u2019s game-plan influenced the delay in announcing the zoning for the office of National Chairman and other party positions.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBuni wants to remain National Chairman; forcing him to organise a National Convention was just a temporary setback. The plan is to declare the National chairmanship position open to the entire North, so that he can contest. Buni has 14 APC governors with him in this plot. His main ally, Abubakar Malami, the Minister of Justice had already cleared the way for him by openly declaring a few weeks back that he could legally combine the office of governor with that of the party\u2019s chairmanship.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY learnt further that Buni, Malami and the 14 governors working with him in the plot would soon meet President Buhari, to convince him on the need for the Yobe governor to continue as chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cOnce they get Buhari\u2019s support, the deal is done. All the other chairmanship candidates will have to step down. Even if they don\u2019t step down, Buni\u2019s name will be the only chairmanship candidate one on the official list of contenders to be voted for on D-Day. This is the list that will be forced on delegates. This guy wants to conduct the 2023 APC primaries and it will be tough stopping this ambition,\u201d added the source.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against the government of President Muhammadu Buhari before an ECOWAS Court over \u201csecrecy in the spending of loans so far obtained, the unsustainable level of borrowing by the government and the 36 states, and the crippling debt burden\".\n\nLast week, SERAP lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi filed a suit before ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja, in which the organisation sought, \u201cAn order directing and compelling the Federal Government to issue an immediate moratorium on borrowing by itself, and the 36 states, in conformity with the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking, \u201cAn order directing and compelling the Federal Government to publish details of spending of the loans obtained by governments since 1999 including the list of projects and locations of any such projects on which these loans have been spent.\u201d\n\nThe organisation maintained that, \u201cPersistent and unsustainable borrowing by the federal and state governments and the crippling debt burden undermine the rights of Nigerians to economic and social development, and are antithetical to the public interest.\n\n\u201cThere is lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of the loans so far obtained, and opacity around the terms and conditions in loan agreements, including repayment details for these loans. The details of the projects on which the loans are spent are shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\u201cWithout a moratorium on borrowing, the Federal Government and many of the 36 states may be caught in a process driven mostly by creditors\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cThis will result in an exorbitant social cost for the marginalised and vulnerable sectors of the population.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and many of the 36 states would seem to be in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress.\n\n\u201cThe Senate and House of Representatives recently approved the loans of $5,803,364,553.50 and a grant component of $10million under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis followed previous approvals by the National Assembly of $16.2 (16,230,077,718) billion loan; \u20ac1 (1,020,000,000) million and a grant component of $125 million loan; $36.8 billion, \u20ac910 million loans, and a grant component of $10 million; $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans; $6.1 billion, $1.5 billion and 995 million loans; and $4(4,054,476,863), \u20ac710 million and grant component of $125million.\n\n\u201cSeveral of the 36 states are also facing a debt crisis, and vicious debt cycles. According to the Debt Management Office, the foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory presently stands at $37.9billion.\n\n\u201cThe loans from China alone amount to $3.59billion. According to the UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Nigeria faces debt service relative to tax revenues that exceed 20 per cent, with escalating social tensions linked to poverty and inequality.\n\n\u201cAccording to the World Bank\u2019s IDA FY21 Report, with debt exposure of $11.7billion US Dollars, Nigeria ranked fifth among the top 10 countries with highest debt risk exposure. The top four countries are India with $22billion, Bangladesh ($18.1billion), Pakistan ($16.4billion), and Vietnam ($14.1billion).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "title": "IDP Chronicles: Children die of cholera in Niger camp after fleeing terror of bandits",
          "text": "When a group of heavily armed men invaded communities in Niger, many residents were forced to flee to Central Primary School, Gwada \u2014 a town in Shiroro LGA of the state.\n\nAzumi Markus is one of them \u2014 she once lived in Sabon Kabila in Munya LGA before she was pressured out of the village by the relentless terror of bandits.\n\nThe mother of two could not remember her exact age but looked quite young. As she rested her frail frame on a brick pillar, she seemed perturbed while watching a group of children devour a bowl of mashed tuwon masara \u2013 a food made from maize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAzumi escaped to the IDP camp with two children but is now left with only one child. After the attack on her village, she had to seek refuge in the bush for over one month.\n\n\u201cAfter the thieves (bandits) invaded, we waited till night and ran into the bush, we stayed in the bush for over one month with nothing above our heads except trees,\u201d she recounted.\n\n\u201cI had my two children with me, the last boy was just about six months old, he seemed very healthy when we arrived at the IDP camp but fell very sick after some weeks and died.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAzumi said when the infant suddenly expelled watery stool and started to throw up, she thought it was the usual discomfort that occurs during teeth development.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to a clinic in Chibiani village, we bought all the medicines we were asked to buy but the vomiting and defecation did not stop. He died and left all the drugs,\u201d she lamented.\n\nCHOLERA IN IDP CAMP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHabibu Kurebe, one of the officials in charge of Gwada IDP camp, said three children were lost to cholera between October and November 2021. He explained that the camp has no medical capacity to handle such cases.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, we had a cholera outbreak here in the IDP camp. We lost about three children to the disease. The IDPs really tried because some of them had to rush the children to hospitals in the town, and thankfully some children were saved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe parents of the children told us that they complained of stomach pains and suddenly started running temperature. This was soon followed by vomiting and defecating loose, watery stools. It was so sudden that we could not even do anything, most of the medicines donated are not usually enough to treat even malaria cases.\u201d\n\nUNHYGIENIC CONDITIONS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the hygiene level in the camp is a serious source of concern as IDPs often leave their food and water containers uncovered and expose themselves to unsanitary conditions due to lack of awareness.\n\n\u201cIf only we can have experts from NGOs or other health organisations that can come here and educate them on the need to sustain proper hygiene because they have no idea how to keep their environment healthy,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on food availability, Kurebe said the IDPs only eat once a day and hardly enjoy a balanced diet, as they mostly feed on the local dami-dami \u2013 mashed food made from maize or millet.\n\n\u201cThe bigger challenge is food, there is not enough food to go round, whenever some organisations bring food, it doesn\u2019t last long because of the population,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I THOUGHT IT WAS MALARIA\u2019\n\nTani Hassan, 37, had just returned from the market when she noticed that she was running a temperature.\n\nHer eyes were hot and her throat parched, so she went to the mud-made container to fetch water to drink.\n\n\u201cI thought it was normal malaria, so I went to drink water with plans to cook but started experiencing body weakness and suddenly had profuse watery diarrhoea. While I was still dealing with that, the diarrhoea came with unbearable abdominal pain. The cramp was like a fire eruption in my stomach,\u201d she recounted.\n\nShe battled cholera for two days without seeking medical attention, choosing to use anti-malaria and painkiller drugs.\n\nTani, a mother of five children who escaped from Kaure in 2019 to resettle in the IDP camp, eventually required treatment at the hospital.\n\n\u201cI opened my eyes and saw myself at the hospital, I didn\u2019t know how I got there but I was told my husband rushed me to the clinic in Tawali\u2014 a village near Gwada town,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was given nothing less than 20 drips before I regained my health. After I was discharged from the clinic, I couldn\u2019t walk properly, the pain from the diarrhoea was still fresh in my anus.\u201d\n\nTani said the camp recorded over ten cases, mostly women, confirming that three toddlers between the ages of three and five died during the outbreak.\n\nWhen she returned from the clinic, Tani said she started to wash her clothes daily and ensured that she bathed regularly.\n\nBut her newfound hygienic practices did not extend to the food she ingests.\n\nResponding to why she often leaves food uncovered, she said it was to prevent them from getting spoilt.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t usually have enough food to eat, do you want us to cover them so that they will get spoilt?\u201d she asked.\n\nDRIVERS OF DISEASE IN IDP CAMPS\n\nBy virtue of their living conditions, many IPDS in various camps are susceptible to cholera, which is caused by factors such as population congestion, open defecation, poor sewage system, poor sanitation and lack of clean water supply.\n\nWhile in Gwanda, TheCable observed that foods undergoing processing were left uncovered with flies feasting on them, and worse still, unhygienic pots were used to prepare meals and food remnants were disposed of close to cooking areas.\n\nThese practices expose IDPs to food and waterborne disease as most camps, formerly government-owned schools, do not have adequate supply of clean water \u2014 a situation that makes open defecation a regular occurrence.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), 26.5 million children do not have access to enough water to meet their daily needs in Nigeria.\n\nAlthough about 70 percent of Nigerians have access to water services, over half of the water sources are polluted and only nine litres of water on average is available to a Nigerian daily.\n\nHOW TO CONTAIN CHOLERA IN IDP CAMPS\n\nAlthough cholera is deadly, it can be contained where adequate access to water supply, hygiene and sanitary facilities are available.\n\nMany IDPs are rural dwellers who have not undergone proper education to understand the gravity of unclean environment and exposed foods.\n\nThe sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 targets access to clean water and proper sanitation. The objective can be achieved when diseases transmitted through unhealthy human activities, such as poor sanitation, open defecation, and poor management of waste, are addressed.\n\nCholera can be curtailed through the integration of water resources management into communities, protection of water resources and water-related ecosystem, provision of capacity-building assistance to communities to develop water and sanitation-related activities and organising programmes on desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, as well as tackling open defecation.",

          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about a year and a half, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. The same year he exited his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\n\n\nChari warehouses\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\n\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Oxfordbuildbay wants you to easily own land, no matter how much you earn",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was with great joy in her heart that she put pen to paper and signed the document, officially making her a landowner in Lagos State, Nigeria. It\u2019s been a lifelong dream of hers, and she couldn\u2019t believe it was actually unfolding before her eyes. She looked at her son, Stephen, who smiled back, beaming with pride.\n\nUnfortunately, this joy would be short-lived. Sadly, Mrs Nwachukwu fell victim to the product of years of anarchy and regulatory laxity and lost the land she bought with her hard-earned money. This experience left a bad taste with Stephen, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he needed to find a solution and immediately contacted his friend, Olamilekan.\n\nThis experience was not unique to Olamilekan Adeniji and Stephen Nwachuckwu, Co-founders of Oxfordbuildbay, a real estate tech startup working to solve problems they\u2019ve experienced first hand.\n\n\u201cWe found that there\u2019s a constant issue around omo onile (traditional landowners), there\u2019s the issue around finding out who actually owns the land. God help you, you might not even get it, or they take you to somewhere farther than you had bargained for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter this experience, we began thinking of ways to use technology to make land ownership more seamless, and affordable for the average Nigerian,\u201d says Nwachukwu\n\nThe entry barrier to real estate in Nigeria is significantly high for speculative investors and those who simply want their own homes. A 2019 survey of 5,000 Nigerians showed that 62 \u2013 63% of owned land comes by family inheritance, and just 18% bought theirs outrightly.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit is more pronounced in urban areas than rural areas. Due to the high living costs, lands in places like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt are prohibitively expensive.\n\nHomeownership stands at 73% in rural areas, compared to 35% in urban areas. Increasing urban migration and continued pressure on infrastructure is worsening Nigeria\u2019s property ownership situation.\n\nIf you check these listings on Jiji, for example, you\u2019ll find a plot of land in Lekki, Lagos, going for \u20a612 billion ($29 million). More than enough money to bankroll the Series A rounds for Paystack and Flutterwave. But you\u2019ll also see a listing as low as \u20a6140,000 in a less developed part of Lagos.\n\nRegardless of what you opt for, you\u2019d still have to deal with uncertainties and the disturbances of omo oniles, who people have come to regard as louts.\n\nSo far, regulatory attention has not featured as effectively as it should in Nigeria\u2019s property space, but Adeniji and Nwachukwu were not about to wait for the government to set things right.\n\nToday, the company they built offers people the chance to pay for lands with as little as \u20a6250 daily for two years, after which it becomes fully theirs. But the journey was a tough one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBraving stormy waters\n\nComing from a background in finance, Nwachukwu sought out Adeniji, who had entrepreneurial experience, to seek a solution for people with similar stories to his mum\u2019s. Nwachukwu recounts that he attended Techpoint Inspired 2019, and he and his partner were inspired to build a product that would solve Nigeria\u2019s housing problems. They called it Buildbay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders of Oxfordbuildbay: Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth (left), Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 MD (right). Source: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the failure of regulations, but we felt there was something we could do to solve the problem. First, we thought we could excuse the omo oniles, so you could trust that the land you buy from the comfort of your home is actually genuine and is verifiable,\u201d Nwachukwu says.\n\nAdeniji points out that it would be very difficult to verify if the omo onile selling a property to you is the actual owner of that land.\n\n\u201cMaybe someone leads you to another person, who then takes you to another family who owns the land. There are always long chains like these,\u201d he reveals.\u201cWhen a company approaches the government to get land, or they approach these same omo oniles, it\u2019s usually a different ball game than when an individual approaches them.\n\nAdeniji opines that the idea was to create a safety net for individuals who do not have the financial might or connection to fend off bullies and poachers from their properties.\n\nFor this to happen, the two founders had to acquire large amounts of land and sort out issues with the omo oniles themselves. If you\u2019ve followed my analysis this far, you can surmise that this would cost a ton of money.\n\nWith no venture capital funding, Buildbay got in talks with Oxford International Group, a multisectoral business empire, that bought into the founders\u2019 vision and absorbed Buildbay to birth the company, Oxfordbuildbay.\n\nWith the platform fully launched, the company had to find ways to onboard users who would appreciate the solution it came up with.\n\n\u201cWe had to leverage the real estate agent network who penetrated deep into the market and pretty much helped onboard people on the platform we built. These guys would go into markets, schools, and several other places. We also had to employ cooperatives because they had a large number of people who would need the products we were offering,\u201d Adeniji explains.\n\nWith the resounding success of this aggressive offline marketing, the company could automate the whole process and limit human interaction as much as possible. Customers could now take their pick of land across Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo and pay with their cards or connect their accounts, so they are automatically debited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nAnother major issue the startup had to tackle was the reputation of hidden charges among real estate developers. To do this, it took up the task of educating people.\n\nLike most founders, getting the right talent became paramount, and they actively sought people who would buy into the company\u2019s vision.\n\nIt looked for talent in industries similar to theirs but also took bets on teachable people who displayed a willingness to learn.\n\n\u201cSometimes we found that the people we hired had bought the product before, so selling our vision to them was a no-brainer,\u201d Adeniji states excitedly.\n\nThis strategy, Adeniji opines, has helped Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s mission so far.\n\nHow Oxfordbuildbay works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxfordbuildbay has optimised its entire process to work for the different kinds of visitors to its website.\n\n\u201cWhen less tech-savvy users head to the website, www.oxfordbuildbay.com, there\u2019s a WhatsApp popup that is so in your face. When you click it, it links you to a support agent who then walks you through the whole process from start to finish,\u201d Nwachukwu explains.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you could simply create an account, log in to your dashboard, click on the land locations, which will bring out the different land locations we have as of today, and then click on buy. It takes you to the cart, and you also get to choose your payment frequency before you pay.\n\nTypically, getting lands from real estate developers usually comes with other hidden or inexplicable charges, but Nwachukwu insists that there\u2019s nothing of the sort with Oxfordbuildbay.\n\n\u201cAll of these with zero allocation fee, zero agency fee, zero documentation fee and allocation can be between the 6th and 12th months while the payment is ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put that in perspective, we\u2019ve helped Nigerians save over N2.3 billion on agency, legal and \u2018omo onile\u2019 fees when acquiring a land,\u201d claims Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve made the payment, you get an offer letter which gives the purchase details \u2014 the size of land you bought, the location you picked, what you have paid, and what is left to pay.\u201d\n\nOxfrordbuildbay measures its lands in small units called \u201cSlots\u201d, which is half a plot. Its plots are usually 300 square metres on Lagos Mainland and everywhere else, and 250 square metres on the Island.\n\nThere are regularly scheduled site inspection visits at different intervals, and any customer can request an inspection for a small fee.\n\nThe startup recently launched its Android app, and its IoS app, creating a fresh avenue for users to access the platform, and begin their land ownership.\n\nBusiness model and expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Akinyinka Akinpelu \u2013 Head of Business, Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth, Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 Managing Director and CEO, Oxfordbuildbay. Source: Supplied.\n\nWithout sharing any specific figures, Nwachukwu insists that Oxfordbuilbay\u2019s entire process ensures that the company is profitable.\n\nHe argues that the company\u2019s business model allows it to capture people from different rungs of the social ladder, and it\u2019s helping to create constant cash flow and make the business sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are upstream financially who are interested in the trust and certainty we offer, as well as people who are looking for affordable and flexible options to own a property.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu likens this strategy to the sachet milk strategy. He states that the company has already acquired huge expanses of land over time, these lands have appreciated, and it made perfect business sense to sell them in little affordable bits.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, it all adds up,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cour mission to democratise homeownership is quite different from any other player out there.\u201d\n\nIt has also put systems in place to deter people from defaulting on payments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say life happens, we wait for 1, 2, and 3 months and there\u2019s still no payment, we adjust the pricing for the land, so you start paying for the land at a reviewed price that factors in land appreciation. Customers who do not default continue to pay for the land at the price it was when they started paying.\u201d\n\nSeveral other factors could lead people to default on payments in a country like Nigeria, and Oxfordbuildbay has a little fail-safe.\n\n\u201cKnowing that health can be a major deterrent when making long term payments like this, we have partnered with an HMO to offer free health insurance to customers who consistently pay for three months.\u201d\n\nWhile this might seem quite generous, the company has an end goal in mind. As Nwachukwu pointed out earlier, the margins actually make sense at the end.\n\n\u201cLike any business, we obviously want to make a profit. But our primary goal is to democratise homeownership and become the brand that Africans come to for their homeownership needs.\u201d\n\nSo far, Nwachukwu reveals that the company has been bootstrapping, but it is looking for funding to expand its offerings which are fast gaining traction across West Africa.\n\nOxfordbuildbay has 20,000 consistent customers, and it has visions of expanding across Nigeria and to other African countries.\n\nNigeria\u2019s property sector has been filled with exciting innovations in recent years, but Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s value proposition is quite compelling, and it creates room for excitement and possibly other similar down-to-earth solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

That is why we are appealing to INEC to make sure that our votes count.\n\n\u201cINEC should not allow selfish politicians to rig the election and thereby put us in another round of suffering again. We need a serious political change in this FCT and we want to achieve that through the coming elections.\n\n\u201cWe want to also use this opportunity to advice residents and natives of Abuja to resist any financial inducement from politicians to buy their votes and conscience. They should resist financial temptations from selfish politicians.\n\n\u201cThey should know that selling their votes is selling their birthright for another three years because politicians who buy their votes do not care about their future.

          "title": "2023 Presidency: PDP Governors Close Ranks, Move To Corner Ticket",
          "text": "Investigation by The Nation revealed that the governors are determined to consolidate on their success at the recent national convention of the party where their favoured candidates emerged as members of the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nTo achieve their objective of producing the presidential candidate, the governors, party sources said, have also resolved to encourage the party leadership to adopt the indirect mode of primary election to nominate the presidential candidate later in the year.\n\nThis, it was learnt, is part of a grand plan to prevent other presidential aspirants, especially former Vice President Abubakar Atiku, from getting the presidential ticket.\n\nA PDP senator said the governors are banking on their current hold on the leadership of the party to achieve their aim.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAt the just-concluded national elective convention of the PDP in Abuja, majority of the governors elected on the platform of our party, working together, showed their might as they literally hand-picked members of the next National Working Committee (NWC) and other national officers of the party.\n\n\u201cThough a couple of governors appeared left out of the arrangement back then, it appears they have now been appeased as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has taken firm charge of the party, and is in a vintage position to decide who will fly the party\u2019s presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cAttempts by other stakeholders in the party including former Vice-President Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki and former Jigawa State Governor Sule Lamido, to wrest control of the party from the governors were unsuccessful as seen in their attempt to install Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola (rtd) as Deputy National Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cThe governors muscled Taofeek Arapaja into the position with their collective influence and delegates. This is a foretaste of what awaits us all when the contest for the presidential ticket of the PDP finally takes off.\u201d\n\nA member of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) corroborated the view, saying the governors made it clear during the crisis ridden days of the party\u2019s former NEC that they were left with no choice than to take over the leadership of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThey are not pretending about what they intend to do,\u201d our source who pleaded anonymity said.\n\n\u201cDuring the discussions to decide who would lead the party after Secondus, several interests and caucuses attempted to take charge.\n\n\u201cThe governors, presidential aspirants, party elders and the National Assembly caucuses; they all struggled for control. But the governors had their way eventually largely because of their number and privileged positions.\n\n\u201cAnd from day one, nobody was left in doubt about their plans.\n\n\u201cRecently, at a meeting with some BoT members in Abuja, a couple of governors revealed that what is best for PDP in 2023 is for the party to repeat its 2007 model when two governors emerged as presidential candidate and running mate.\n\n\u201cTheir argument is that the party needs funds and widespread mobilization for its campaign, and it is only a group like the Governors\u2019 Forum that can marshal such funding and mobilization in the current circumstance.\u201d\n\nThe Nation further gathered that the governors are convinced that only a concerted effort on the part of the group can stop the plan by Atiku to pick the PDP ticket again.\n\nSources said Governor Duoye Diri of Bayelsa and Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa, who were initially not part of the plot executed by their colleagues to take over the party last December, were reconciled to the larger house shortly before and after the convention respectively as part of efforts to ensure unanimity in the actions of the governors going forward.\n\n\u201cPDP governors are all on the same page on these issues as we speak. They are working together,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nA zonal Vice Chairman of the party in the immediate past NWC told our correspondent in confidence that with the outcome of the last elective convention, the governors have announced themselves as the undisputed owners of the party.\n\n\u201cPresidential aspirants of the party, including Anyim, Atiku, Lamido, Kwankwaso and Saraki, already know what they are in for. They know the governors would have a big say in the 2023 presidential contest.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that without the support of the governors, you can\u2019t win a big position in the PDP of today. This is the message I think everyone took home from that convention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge among leaders of the party that the governors are working in that direction since after the convention.\n\n\u201cAnd one of the plans is to foist indirect mode of primary election on the party for the nomination of the presidential flag-bearer.\n\n\u201cThe talks are already on and the leadership of the party that will decide is firmly under the control of the governors.\n\n\u201cBut if you ask me, I will say there is nothing wrong in what they are doing because we are all politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered that the governors are trying to convert more party members to support their plot.\n\nAt one of their meetings, it was resolved that governors would move against any consideration of direct primary by the PDP.\n\nTo achieve this, members were asked to sensitise NASS members in their various states and get their support for the plot.\n\n\u201cAlready, members of the NWC from all the states controlled by the governors are in their kitty and will readily agree to the dictates of the governors.\n\n\u201cThe challenges they have now are in states not governed by the PDP.\n\n\u201cTo overcome this challenge, they plan to use the zonal leadership of the party to control these states. That explains the fierce political wars in some zones over party positions.\n\n\u201cThe Southwest, North-central and the South-south are good examples.\n\n\u201cWhile the governors can confidently boast of pulling their plot through in the 13 PDP-controlled states, they are working hard to penetrate the other states where they don\u2019t have one of their own in charge.\n\n\u201cThese states are the hopes of Atiku and others. But if the governors go into the race united and the other aspirants split the available states, you can guess what will happen.\u201d",

          "text": "Father of a 8- year-old girl, Asmau Shaibu, has revealed how his daughter was allegedly kidnapped and killed after 42 days in captivity in Zaria, Kaduna state.\n\nBarely 48 hours after the news of the kidnap and eventual killing of Hanifa, by her teacher in Kano went viral, residents of Zaria were thrown into mourning following the murder of the eight-year-old Asma\u2019u, who was kidnapped and later killed by her suspected neighbour, 42 days later.\n\nAsmau was kidnapped on the 9th of December 9, 2021, after which the abductors demanded N15 million as ransom from her father, Alhaji Shaibu Wa\u2019alamu.\n\nHe said he paid the sum of N3.045 million as negotiated, with the kidnappers assuring him of her safe return, only to be told later that she has been killed.\n\nAlhaji Wa\u2019alamu recounted his ordeal to newsmen in Zaria on Saturday on how his daughter was abducted and eventually killed by her captors after paying the ransom demanded by them.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was abducted on the 9th of December and when she failed to return home, I lodged a formal complaint with the police.\n\n\u201cAfter some days, the abductors began to call my number and demanded for N15 million. But we negotiated and I first gave them N2 million.\n\n\u201cThey collected the money in Rigasa area of Kaduna. Later, they called me again and demanded for another N1.045m as the only condition to release my daughter.\n\n\u201cI did not argue. But I gave the money to them. However, after paying the ransom as demanded on the 19th of January, they called me to tell me they have killed her, and switched off their phone. From the initial stage, I was following her abductors and doing their bidding because of the fear of losing her. Now, they have killed her.\n\n\u201cI know those who abducted her and killed her.

          "text": "Nigeria will continue its quest for a fourth continental title when the knockout stages of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) begin on Sunday. They will take on the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in a Round of 16 tie in Garoua.\n\nThe match is one of the mouth-watering games to look out for in the knockout phase of the competition.\n\nThe Super Eagles come into the clash on the back of dominant displays that saw them win all three group games in Cameroon, a feat no team achieved. They have also managed to shake off the turbulence \u2013sacking of long-serving coach, Gernot Rohr and the absence of key players \u2013 that marred their buildup to the tournament.\n\nIn a group containing record-holders, Egypt; Sudan, and Guinea-Bissau, the three-time African champions outclassed their foes, earning them a competition-favourite tag. Coach Austine Eguavoen\u2019s side have scored six goals so far and conceded one. But the team have not let in any goal in open play with Sudan breaching their defense via a penalty in their second match.\n\nThe West Africans have not lost in their last six games heading into Sunday\u2019s cracker at the Roumde Adija Stadium. Aside from the draw against Cape Verde at home in a 2022 World Cup qualifier, Nigeria have recorded wins in all matches to date.\n\nThey parade a mean defence with William Troost-Ekong in the heart. The 2013 African champions have conceded twice in their last six games.\n\nNine goals in six matches (plus the flurry of missed chances in Cameroon), is a testament to Nigeria\u2019s deadly attacking force which includes in-form Simon Moses, Samuel Chukwueze, and Union Berlin\u2019s Taiwo Awoniyi.\n\nIn fact, Nigeria\u2019s six goals at the 2021 AFCON have come from six different players, a record that only speaks to the depth of offensive talents at Eguavoen\u2019s disposal.\n\nNigeria Team News\n\nFor Sunday\u2019s encounter, the Super Eagles are expected to stick to a familiar lineup since the competition began. Maduka Okoye, Zaidu Sanusi, Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo, and Ola Aina will most likely retain their places in defence.\n\nJoe Aribo of Rangers and Leicester City\u2019s midfield enforcer, Wilfred Ndidi, will man the centre. Simon Moses, Kelechi Iheanacho, Samuel Chukwueze, and Taiwo Awoniyi will also be in contention for a starting berth.\n\nThe team has no injury worries or COVID-19 issues ahead of the Tunisia match. The only outfield player that has so far not tasted action in Cameroon is Chidozie Awaziem.\n\nTunisia\n\nThe Super Eagles\u2019 opponent, have, however, had a tumultuous ride so far in the competition. Regarded as one of the powerhouses of African football, the Carthage Eagles suffered a poor start to the campaign. They lost to Mali 0-1 in their opening fixture at the Limbe Omnisport Stadium but shook off the defeat with a 4-0 demolition of minnows, Mauritania.\n\nIn their last game against The Gambia, the 2004 winners were expected to earn all three points at stake. Mondher Kebaier\u2019s men, however, fell agonizingly to the debutants all thanks to Ablie Jallow\u2019s 93rd-minute winner.\n\nThe victory took the Scorpions to the knockout stages, leaving Tunisia to finish as one of the third best-placed sides.\n\nA look at the team\u2019s form showed that they have lost three and won three of their last six matches. At the AFCON, the North Africans have lost twice and recorded a victory in one.\n\nTunisia Team News\n\nThe Carthage Eagles have been severely hit by COVID-19 cases. Ahead of the clash with The Gambia, seven of their players tested positive for the disease.\n\nThis included skipper, Wahbi Khazri, who netted twice in the victory over Mauritania. In his absence, Seifeddine Jaziri, was picked and has so far made two consecutive starts in the competition. The Zamalek star is expected to line up against Nigeria on Sunday.\n\nBut the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the Tunisian camp has jumped from seven to 12 players. Aside from the trio of Aissa Laidouni, Ellyes Skhiri and Anis Ben Slimane, Coach Kebaier has also been ruled out of the tie.\n\nGoalkeeper Ben Mustapha is on suspension following his red card against The Gambia while Hamza Mathlouthi will be out of action in the match due to accumulated yellow cards.\n\nNigeria Vs Tunisia: A Head-To-Head Record\n\nThe last 16 encounters will be Nigeria\u2019s 20th meeting with Tunisia at the international level. Both sides claimed victory in six games while eight of them have ended in draws.\n\nAt the AFCON, Nigeria and the North Africans have clashed three times since the 2000 edition of the championship. In 2004, Tunisia beat Nigeria on penalties in the semi-final en route to lifting the trophy. But in 2006, it was time for revenge as the Super Eagles defeated them in the quarter-final.\n\nTunisia and Nigeria were to lock horns again at the third-place match during the last continental showpiece. An early strike from former Watford forward, Odion Ighalo, settled the scores in 2019 as Nigeria won bronze.\n\nGoals from Mohamed Drager and Leicester City star, Kelechi Iheanacho, also saw both teams sharing the spoils in a friendly game in 2020.\n\nNigeria Vs Tunisia 2021 AFCON Match Time\n\nThe match between Nigeria and Tunisia at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) will start at 8:00pm (WAT).",

Go and clear those areas, apply to the state government, each of you, at least N20 million for a start to hire the equipment.\n\n\u201cThat does not mean you will wait before you start. You must start today, tomorrow. CP, please give them the security to do this work. Don\u2019t give them two policemen.\u201d\n\nThis comes a week after the governor asked the police commissioner to collaborate with heads of other security agencies in Rivers, council chairmen, and traditional rulers to fish out all those involved in illegal bunkering and artisanal refining for prosecution.\n\nHe had accused persons engaged in illegal bunkering and artisanal refining of being responsible for the soot polluting the air and endangering the health of residents of the state.\n\nThe governor also declared that the state government has resolved to curb the activities of those involved in crude oil theft and refining once and for all.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been renewed calls to the Federal Government to provide modular refineries to curb the economic sabotage.",

It comes amid high tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia\u2019s designs on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe disinformation spread by the British Foreign Office is more evidence that it is the NATO countries, led by the Anglo-Saxons, who are escalating tensions around Ukraine,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging app Sunday. \u201cWe call on the British Foreign Office to stop provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense.\u201d\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the information \u201cshines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking.\u201d\n\nTruss urged Russia to \u201cdeescalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,\u201d and reiterated Britain\u2019s view that \u201cany Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.\u201d\n\nBritain has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine as part of efforts to bolster its defenses against a potential Russian attack.\n\nAmid diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to meet Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for talks in Moscow. No timing has been given for the meeting, which would be the first U.K.-Russia bilateral defense talks since 2013.\n\nThe U.S. has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent months to unify its European allies against a new Russian invasion of Ukraine.

          "title": "Q/Final Place at Stake as Super Eagles Expect Tough Battle with Covid-Ravaged Tunisia on Sunday",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s manager Augustine Eguavoen says he expects a tough duel between his Super Eagles and the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in Sunday\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 encounter in Garoua.\n\nTunisia\u2019s campaign has been somewhat ravaged by positive COVID tests and the team only qualified for the knockout stage as one of the best losers, finishing in third place behind The Gambia and Mali, and winning only one of their three matches while losing the other two.\n\n\u201cI expect a very tough game against the Tunisians. Our group will not be lulled into any sense of superiority over any team here until we do the business on the field. Tunisia is a big name in African football and we must acknowledge that, despite the manner in which they reached this stage.\n\n\u201cWe have watched some of their games and from what we know of them in the distant past and in lucid memory, they are never a team to take for granted.\u201d\n\nEguavoen\u2019s 51 caps for Nigeria did not include an encounter with Tunisia, but he was head coach of the Super Eagles when Nigeria upended the Carthage Eagles on penalty shootout in Port Said in Egypt 16 years ago to send the Cup holders out of the tournament at the quarter final stage.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge, huge game and a memorable one for me. The match ended 1-1 in regulation and extra time and we had to go into penalties. We lost two of our first three kicks or something like that and then bounced back when our goalkeeper (Vincent Enyeama) stopped two of their kicks. It was a sweet victory,\u201d Eguavoen said.\n\nAt the Al Masry Stadium on 4th February 2006, Obinna Nsofor scored for Nigeria before Karim Haggui levelled for the Cup holders. In the shootout, Joseph Yobo and Yusuf Ayila missed as Chedli and Ben Achour did for Tunisia. Taye Taiwo, Nsofor and Obafemi Martins scored, as did Namouchi, Guemamdia and Jose Clayton for Tunisia. In sudden death, John Mikel Obi and goalkeeper Enyeama scored for Nigeria as did goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel and Hadj Massaoud for Tunisia, but after Nwankwo Kanu scored for Nigeria, Riadh Bouazizi saw his kick saved by Enyeama.\n\nIn dim and distant memory, Tunisia reached the final round of the 1978 FIFA World Cup African series after an own goal by Godwin Odiye in Lagos on 12th November 1977 eliminated Nigeria, but the following year, Nigeria earned the bronze medals of the 11th AFCON when Tunisia abandoned the match in the 42nd minute following an equalizer by Baba Otu Mohammed. Nigera were awarded the match 2-0.\n\nIn 1980, both countries tied 2-2 on aggregate in a Spain 82 World Cup qualifying fixture, with Nigeria proceeding after penalty shootout. In 1985, Tunisia edged their 1986 World Cup qualifying fixture 2-1 on aggregate \u2013 a lone goal by Okey Isima cancelled out with a two-goal blitz in the first 15 minutes of the return inside the Stade El Menzah in Tunis.\n\nIn recent and decent memory, Nigeria edged their opening encounter of the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations 4-2 in Lagos, with Jay Jay Okocha and Victor Ikpebe earning a brace each. In 2009, a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture ended 0-0 and 2-2 in Tunis and Abuja, and in 2019 Nigeria won the bronze medals of the 32nd AFCON 1-0 in Cairo at the expense of the Carthage Eagles.\n\nTheir most recent encounter was a friendly game in Austria in October 2020, which ended 1-1 with Nigeria\u2019s goal scored by Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nOn Sunday at the Stade Roumd\u00e9 Adjia, Nigeria will file out with three wins in three from their group phase campaign. The Tunisians were only able to defeat Mauritania while losing to Mali and The Gambia. Both countries are led by indigenous coaches. Mondher Kebaier will sit on the Tunisians\u2019 bench.\n\nThe match will be Eguavoen\u2019s 16th for Nigeria across three stints, during which he has walked off the pitch victorious in 13 of the previous 15, with only two narrow defeats. He is also the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three group phase matches at the AFCON, achieving this in both his AFCON odysseys in 2006 and 2022.\n\nThe usual in-tournament extra incentives \u2013 a practice entrenched over the decades \u2013 have started flowing in for the Eagles. Billionaire businessman Femi Otedola has dedicated the naira equivalent of $250,000 for the team to win the trophy, just as airline owner Allen Onyema has promised N50million if the team marches to the final on 6th February and is triumphant.\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele says the CACOVID (a coalition of private sector companies set up to fight COVID pandemic in Nigeria) will shell out the sum of $120,000 for the six goals already scored by the Eagles in Cameroon, and $50,000 (naira equivalent) for every goal in the Round of 16 clash with Tunisia.\n\nAirline owner Onyema had earlier promised the team the sum of N10million for every goal.\n\nCosta Rica 2022: Falconets confident as they battle Cameroon in Douala\n\nNigeria\u2019s U20 girls, Falconets are buoyed by the performance of the Super Eagles at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, and say they are motivated for a great result when they take on their Cameroonian counterparts in a FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifying match in Douala on Saturday.\n\nCoach Chris Danjuma watched his girls limber up briefly to shake off jet lag following their arrival in Douala on Thursday, and have been scheduled for a feel of the match venue \u2013 Stade Japoma de Douala \u2013 on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWe are highly motivated by the performance of the Super Eagles so far at the AFCON here in Cameroon. It is a huge tonic for us to go all out and overwhelm our opponents,\u201d Danjuma said.\n\nProlific scorers Mercy Idoko, Flourish Sebastine and Esther Onyenezide are among Danjuma\u2019s 23-woman army for Saturday\u2019s encounter with the Young Lionesses. It is the penultimate round of the African qualifying series for the tournament scheduled for Costa Rica in the month of August.\n\nNFF condoles 3SC over death of Rasheed Balogun\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation has commiserated with the Management and Players of Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan over the death of the club\u2019s General Manager, Mr Rasheed Balogun.\n\nBalogun, a highly experienced and respected club administrator, died in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Thursday night.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the NFF, Dr Mohammed Sanusi said: \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we have learned of the passing on of Rasheed Balogun, someone we have known over the years as an energetic, dedicated and charismatic club administrator.

          "text": "Heavy arms fire at the capital Ouagadougou\u2019s Sangoule Lamizana camp, which houses the army\u2019s general staff and a prison whose inmates include soldiers involved in a failed 2015 coup attempt, began at least as early as 5:00 a.m. (0500 GMT), a Reuters reporter said. The reporter later saw soldiers firing into the air in the camp. A witness also reported gunfire at a military camp in Kaya, around 100 kms (62 miles) north of Ouagadougou. Gunfire rang out from several military camps in Burkina Faso early on Sunday, the government said, but it denied the military had seized power. Burkina Faso\u2019s government confirmed gunfire at some military camps but denied reports on social media that the army had seized power.\n\n\u201cInformation on social networks suggests a takeover by the army. The government, while confirming gunfire at certain barracks, denies this information and calls on the population to remain calm,\u201d government spokesman Alkassoum Maiga said in a statement. Governments in West and Central Africa are on high alert for coups after successful putsches over the past 18 months in Mali and Guinea. The military also took over in Chad last year after President Idriss Deby died on the battlefield. Burkinabe authorities arrested a dozen soldiers earlier this month on suspicion of conspiring against the government. The arrests followed a shake-up within the army\u2019s leadership in December, which some analysts saw as an effort by President Roch Kabore to shore up his support within the military. Rising violence in the West African country by Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State killed over 2,000 people last year, prompting violent street protests in November calling for Kabore to step down. Additional demonstrations were planned for Saturday, but the government banned them and the police intervened to disperse the hundreds of people who tried to assemble in Ouagadougou. The government has suspended mobile internet service on several occasions, and the tense situation in November led the U.N. special envoy to West Africa to warn against any military takeover. Among the inmates at the Sangoule Lamizana camp prison is General Gilbert Diendere, who was a top ally of Burkina Faso\u2019s former president, Blaise Compaore. Compaore was overthrown in a 2014 uprising.\n\nDiendere led a failed coup attempt the following year against the transitional government. He was sentenced in 2019 to 20 years in prison. He is also currently on trial in connection with the killing of Compaore\u2019s predecessor, Thomas Sankara, during a coup in 1987.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Oil and Gas Industry to Face Liquidity Challenges in 2022, Report Says",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry may struggle with liquidity challenges in 2022, a new report by Mordor Intelligence, a global market research and intelligence firm, has predicted.\n\nThe report also projected a slow Compound Annual Growth Rate of (CAGR) of two per cent for the industry during the period under review, on the back of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn its market overview for the year, the research firm noted that oil and gas production had been hampered in Nigeria in the past few years due to the attack on oil infrastructure by militants.\n\nFurthermore, it explained that oil theft had been one of the major issues faced by the market in Nigeria, which has resulted in huge losses to operating companies in the country. \u201cSuch factors are expected to hurt the market growth during the forecast period,\u201d it said.\n\nFor months, Nigeria has been struggling to match its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota, losing millions of barrels in 2021, according to the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NURPC).\n\nThe commission had lamented that with the OPEC production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February this year, it is only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently, leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd daily, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that translates to roughly about $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that requires these funds,\u201d the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr Gbenga Komolafe told a visiting senate committee.\n\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the country\u2019s oil assets.\n\nHowever, the Mordor report noted that some of the major factors that would drive the market during this period could include increasing investments in the upstream sector and the development of large-scale modular refineries in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian oil and gas market is expected to register a CAGR of more than two per cent during the forecast period. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hampered the growth of the market, mainly due to global oil and gas demand contraction and global economic slowdown.\n\n\u201cThe outbreak of COVID-19 led to the crude oil price crash of April 2020, leading to a significant reduction in Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) spending by oil and gas companies globally.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s national oil and gas companies were already struggling with liquidity and cash shortage, and due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the situation has further deteriorated,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt projected that although Nigeria\u2019s offshore oil and gas industry continues to expand, albeit it will be very slow.\n\nIn the downstream, the firm noted that lack of infrastructure and security concerns are leading Nigeria to underutilise its refining capacities, thereby pushing the country to become a net importer of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria is on the edge of altering refined products\u2019 supply dynamics in the region with the help of the upcoming Dangote Refinery, and it is expected to become the regional refining hub in the coming years.\n\n\u201cOnce completed, the country is planning to become the refinery hub in Africa. This, in turn, is expected to attract foreign players to tap into the country\u2019s downstream market in the near future,\u201d it added\n\nGiven the country\u2019s huge gas reserves and its advantage as a clean fuel, the report pointed out that gas has already witnessed a massive surge in its domestic consumption in recent years.\n\nThe shift to gas, it stated, is also supported by the fact that major oil reserves are likely to get dry in the coming three to four decades.\n\n\u201cHence, the oil market is considered to be one of the most vulnerable markets where natural gas has the highest potential to penetrate.\n\n\u201cMoreover, gas production has become a major focus for the oil and gas companies, in response to strong investment in gas-to-power projects, across the region,\u201d it noted.\n\nIt explained that the growth of Nigeria\u2019s offshore exploration and production activities has been mainly driven by the efforts of governments in the region, as well as a growing list of international oil and gas companies interested in exploring alternative fields to replace the maturing offshore producing sites.\n\n\u201cThe China National Offshore Oil Corporation mobilised a $3 billion investment, in addition to the $14 billion already spent on its existing oil and gas operations in the West African country.\n\n\u201cA large share of this investment goes into the operations in Nigeria. One of the most ambitious ultra-deep offshore projects is the Egina oil field in water depths between 1,400 and 1,700 meters,\u201d it added.\n\nAs one of the largest and oldest oil producers in Africa, it stated that the oil and gas sector is one of the most important sectors in the country\u2019s economy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the country\u2019s exports.\n\n\u201cAs of 2020, Nigeria had the largest oil and gas reserves in the African region, with around 37 million barrels of crude oil (36,910) and 5.5 trillion cubic meters of gas,\u201d the firm said.\n\nAccording to the research firm, the privatisation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and the creation of a limited liability corporation into which the ministers of finance and petroleum would transfer NNPC assets, could make it easier for the struggling company to raise funds.\n\nBut the market intelligence company stated that foreign investment in the country\u2019s oil and gas sector is expected to slow down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby hampering the growth of the market during the forecast period.",
