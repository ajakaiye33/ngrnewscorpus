          "text": "The World Health Organisation has recommended two new drugs for COVID-19, providing yet more options for treating the disease.\n\nThe WHO, in a statement on its website, said the extent to which these medicines would save lives depends on how widely available and affordable they would be.\n\nThe statement partly reads in part, \u201cThe first drug, baricitinib, is strongly recommended for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. It is part of a class of drugs called Janus kinase inhibitors that suppress the overstimulation of the immune system. WHO recommends that it is given with corticosteroids.\n\n\u201cBaricitinib is an oral drug, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It provides an alternative to other arthritis drugs called Interleukin-6 receptor blockers, recommended by WHO in July 2021.\u201d\n\nWHO also conditionally recommended the use of a monoclonal antibody drug, sotrovimab, for treating mild or moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of hospitalisation.\n\n\u201cThis includes patients who are older, immunocompromised, having underlying conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and those unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cSotrovimab is an alternative to casirivimab-imdevimab, a monoclonal antibody cocktail recommended by WHO in September 2021. Studies are ongoing on the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies against Omicron but early laboratory studies show that sotrovimab retains its activity,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe panel of experts developing the guidelines also looked at two other drugs for severe and critical COVID-19, ruxolitinib and tofacitinib.\n\nGiven their uncertain effects, WHO made a conditional recommendation against their use.\n\nThe two newly recommended drugs \u2013 baricitinib and sotrovimab \u2013 have been invited for WHO Prequalification, which assesses the quality, efficacy and safety of priority health products to increase access in lower-income countries.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Liverpool still have two games in hand but are a point further back in third.\n\nVictory also caps an impressive turnaround for Guardiola and his players, who lost three consecutive matches with Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea last season, as their hopes of an unprecedented quadruple and first Champions League success both went up in smoke.\n\nIn Lisbon last May, a teary-eyed De Bruyne left the pitch with a broken cheekbone as well as a broken heart, but he will never stop fighting for more success.\n\nFor many, the superiority that City displayed on Saturday came as little surprise. After all, they had won by the same scoreline at Stamford Bridge back in September in equally impressive fashion, when a buzzing front five pinned Chelsea back into their own half for nearly the entire game.\n\nThe Blues arguably carried even less threat in the return fixture.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s latest tactical masterclass \u2013 which he had more than a week to work on from his city centre apartment after a COVID-19 isolation period \u2013 resulted in Chelsea failing to have a single shot on target in the first half.\n\nRomulu Lukaku broke through at the start of the second half and forced a good save from Ederson but City were still bossing the game at that point.\n\nOnce again operating without an orthodox striker, City\u2019s wingers carried an incessant attacking threat, as well as stifling the visitors\u2019 rare raids forward.\n\nRaheem Sterling played high and wide, constantly turning Marcos Alonso inside and out, drawing the Spaniard into an early yellow card before later attracting a foul that would have been a penalty but for an offside in the build-up.\n\nOn the other side, Jack Grealish played more as a typical winger, making runs behind Cesar Azpilicueta that seemed to cause Tuchel\u2019s side problems they weren\u2019t expecting.\n\nGrealish blew the best chance of the first half when a heavy touch with just Kepa to beat gave the Chelsea goalkeeper the chance to close him down, spread his body and get a crucial touch to divert the Englishman\u2019s shot wide.\n\nA goal could have been transformative for his confidence and looked like it could have been costly in such a technical game of few clear-cut opportunities.\n\nBut with a magician like De Bruyne within their ranks, Man City are always capable of producing something special out of nothing, which is precisely why they are once again set to end the season as champions.

In keeping with our avowed solidarity with our Leader, the entire Biafra land will be on lock down only on January 18 for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cBiafrans should understand that 19th January is the judgment day in the suit by our Leader against the Federal Government which is pending before an Umuahia High Court.

So, if eventually Osinbajo gets to make public his own declaration, which of them, will the Yoruba as represented by these groups support? That was the question that Saturday Sun put to some of their leaders. National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cFor now, Afenifere does not have a position on any presidential aspirant. Our position is that the 2023 presidency must come to the southern part of Nigeria. The talk on whether we have narrowed it down to any part of Southern Nigeria has not come up at all.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, on his own part, told Saturday Sun, in a phone chat, that both Tinubu and Osinbajo have capacities to govern Nigeria very well. He noted that Tinubu has made his intention known that he would contest for the plum job, while Osinbajo has not made any such declaration. Asked the position of the Yoruba Council of Elders on the duo, he simply said: \u201cIt is premature to make comments on whom to support between the two of them. So, let us leave it like that.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIn his contribution to the debate, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, Communication Secretary, the Ilana Omo Oodua, under the leadership of Prof Banji Akintoye, said that the organisation would not support any presidential aspirant or candidate because it does not believe in the 2023 elections and it does not want it to hold, including the governorship polls in Ekiti and Osun States billed for later in the year. But he was quick to add that the organisation has nothing personal against Tinubu or any other person who wants to contest the 2023 presidential poll.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not believe in the constitution of Nigeria. We are calling for a sovereign national conference or a transition government that will preside over the conference, and we will discuss on our sovereignty. The Ilana Omo Oouda already said we want to leave Nigeria. So, when we get to the negotiation table, we will discuss how we want to peacefully exit Nigeria. So, we have made it clear that we are not interested in the 2023 elections. In fact, we are starting with Ekiti and Osun governorship elections. We will not participate in any election that will be conducted through the 1999 constitution. It is a rape on our people and a fraud.\u201d\n\nOther groups like Agbekoya Farmers Society (AFS) and Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) also made their intentions known. While the National Secretary of Agbekoya, Prince Adegbenro Ogunlana, said that the group did not care where the president comes from or who emerges as president as long the current constitution, which he said was foisted on Nigeria by the military, is not reviewed, Publicity Secretary, OPC, Yinka Oguntimehin added that the group\u2019s position on the future of Nigeria is clearly stated in their belief in restructuring. \u201cThat is why we root for regionalism as the best option for peace and stability in the polity. Even if an angel emerges the president of this nation today, without restructuring, nothing will change for better.\u201d Former Minister of Works and National Chairman, Southwest Agenda for Tinubu (SWAGA), Senator Dayo Adeyeye said that the 16 All Progressives Congress (APC) governors are solidly behind the presidential aspiration of Tinubu.\n\nHe disclosed this in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, on Thursday while inaugurating the parallel APC ward and local executives, adding that they have a keen interest in the actualisation of his presidential bid. In his view, former chairman of APC in Lagos State, Henry Ajomale, noted that although both have the rights to contest, Tinubu has always nursed the ambition to be president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf Osinbajo happens to be Tinubu\u2019s political son and he installed him as the Vice President because he didn\u2019t want to be the Vice President and decided to wait for his turn to run as President, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with that. Osinbajo is aware of this right from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), confirmed its endorsement of Tinubu as a presidential hopeful while noting that it fits into its long-term aspiration of having a Yoruba Muslim rule the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the time Yoruba Muslims need the support of their Muslim brethren all over the country to ensure that Tinubu emerges as the candidate of his party at the primaries,\u201d it said in a public statement. \u201cThey should also vote for him massively during the presidential elections to ensure that he emerges as the president of Nigeria to be sworn in on 29th May, 2023.\u201d",
          "summary": "The groups include Afenifere, Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Oodua People\u2019s Congress (OPC), the Agbekoya Farmers Society (AFS), and the apex Yoruba self-determination organisation, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO).\nSo, if eventually Osinbajo gets to make public his own declaration, which of them, will the Yoruba as represented by these groups support?\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cFor now, Afenifere does not have a position on any presidential aspirant.\nOur position is that the 2023 presidency must come to the southern part of Nigeria.\nBut he was quick to add that the organisation has nothing personal against Tinubu or any other person who wants to contest the 2023 presidential poll.",

          "title": "2023: Why South East must produce president \u2013 Asari Dokubo",
          "text": "Alhaji Mujadid Asari \u2013 Dokubo, an Ijaw nation freedom fighter, is a staunch supporter of former President Goodluck Jonathan. But in this interview with Femi Folaranmi at his country home in Harry\u2019s Town, Asari- Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, he advised the former president not cave to pressure to contest the 2023 Presidential. Rather he said Jonathan should back any South- Easterner for the topmost job in the country.\n\nAsari- Dokubo who insisted that the South- East is the most qualified region to produce the Presidency in 2023, said the South- West has no right to contest after former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who he described as a mischief maker, had done eight years.\n\nRecently there was a face-off between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Chief Edwin Clark on who owns the oil resources in Niger Delta. What is your take on this?\n\nGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo is a mischief maker. He makes mischief at all times. If Nigeria is a federation, the resources found in a place belong to the federating unit. In Zamfara, they are extracting their gold and selling, but Obasanjo is too afraid to talk. And I blame our leaders for what is happening. A situation when they brought amnesty, I told them this is wrong, that we are being criminalised but people jumped at the money. It is we that did not jump at the money; we that we did not expect it were regarded as betrayers. Those who accepted the money were celebrated. Our father, Chief Clark also celebrated these people, giving them accolades and so on. Now the chicken has come home to roost. Obasanjo is a mischief maker, the oil belongs to the people under whose land it is found and there is nothing you can do about that.\n\nYou are known to have been against a Buhari Presidency. Do you have any regrets?\n\nI did not support Muhammadu Buhari but people were supporting him. Even those who pretended not to support him supported. People were cutting deals. I was tagged being antagonistic, bearing in mind that I have more affinity with him than any of them. I am a Muslim for crying out loud. So for now I have decided that I don\u2019t want to be in that sort of situation where I would be on one side and other people would be enjoying and I would abuse him, and others would be cutting deals. I won\u2019t be in that sort of condition again. For me, since everybody is enjoying him, we are all going to enjoy it together.\n\nWhat is your take on rotational presidency?\n\nIn every heterogeneous society, leadership positions ought to be assigned in a way that every part of the society would feel a deep sense of patriotism and hold the state dear. But a situation where one party takes at the expense of others fraudulently, then there would be dissent and people would not recognize the authority. Like what is happening in Nigeria, if one section takes upon itself to rule at the expense of others, it would create resentment.\n\nIn your honest view, which of the Southern regions \u2013 South-East, South-South and South-West should go for the Presidency in 2023?\n\nIt should be South- East. They are the most qualified. It is the same thing we are saying. If we are accusing the North of grabbing power, why would the South-West go? Obasanjo has done this for eight years. Why would South-South go? Goodluck Jonathan has done six years. So it should be South- East.\n\nWhy South-East?\n\nBecause if we want national integration, if we want everybody to be on the same page, then why would we leave out the South-East? Since after the Biafra Civil war, no South-Easterner has become President or Head of State or Head of Government of any kind. So why should they be excluded if they are part of Nigeria.\n\nBut there are arguments in some quarters that the South- South did not complete its mandatory eight year tenure?\n\nIt is not the fault of anybody that Jonathan did not complete his two-term tenure. Jonathan sat down there with all the AK 47 and allowed himself to be chased away with sticks. It is not the fault of the South- East. Jonathan served, but he did not protect the Presidency. It is the truth. I am a Goodluck supporter but that is the truth.\n\nThere have been insinuations that Goodluck Jonathan is being pressured to defect to the APC to run again for president. What is your take on this?\n\nHow can Goodluck ever contemplate going to APC? That is why some of us have come to see ourselves as being foolish. How can Goodluck, after all the quarrel, abuse, some of his supporters starved, lost their businesses and suffered, then all of a sudden without any consideration, we are hearing through the social media that he wants to go to APC. Go to APC to do what? So his interests override all of our interests. All the sacrifices we made, lost our businesses, became hungry would be in vain.\n\nSo what is your advice to him?\n\nThere is nothing I can say other than it is in bad taste if he contemplates joining APC.\n\nSo if he goes to APC to contest, won\u2019t you support him?\n\nI have only one vote.\n\nAre you going to support him with one vote?\n\nI have only one vote. The one I supported, I am starving. Now I am not being consulted, I am not considered as being important to be consulted. I have not been told. So why should I make that sort of sacrifice. Buhari has stayed six years, I did not die. So if Goodluck comes for another four years, I would also not die.\n\nSo you will be backing a South-Easterner for Nigerian Presidency in 2023?\n\nYes, if a South- Easterner comes and he is serious. They are the most qualified people to contest.\n\nYou supported former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar in 2019.\n\nNo, I did not support Atiku.\n\nBut you rooted for him. I had an interview with you where you backed to get the PDP ticket.\n\nYes, I said he was the best the PDP could present. But during the election I did not support him. I didn\u2019t vote in the Presidential elections. I only voted in the governorship election. Atiku did not say anything that makes me feel if becomes President, things would change. He did not say anything to that effect.\n\nWhat if PDP presents him in 2023?\n\nI will still not vote for him, because up till now he has not said anything that would give us assurance that he meant well for Ijaw people.\n\nSouth-West is seriously clamouring for the Presidency through Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nSouth-West has no right to clamour. It is this nonsense that should stop. They have no right, no reason whatsoever to clamour for the Presidency. Obasanjo ruled for eight years. When you assume that you are more important, more entitled than other people, it breeds problems. What makes South-West think they are more entitled than the South-East to be President? In 2015 it was almost 50-50 votes. So what votes do they have that they are bringing to the table? The South-East voted overwhelmingly for the PDP. South-West voted 50-50 for APC and PDP. So what gives South-West this entitlement mentality that they are more entitled than the South- East?\n\nWhat is your view on the spate of insecurity across the country?\n\nThat is what you get when some people feel they are stronger and can do whatever they like. That is the situation in which we found ourselves. President Buhari campaigned on the mantra that he is going to do this and that. And some of us were saying it is not possible. But they told us to shut up and were abusing us. It is this thing that makes you feel that you are more than others that triggers resentment and people pick arms to fight. This gave rise to people like Nnamdi Kanu to appear to put Igbos under bondage. This system creates monsters because there is so much lopsidedness in appointments and all the things that are going on and the people say it and you are not doing anything to correct it.\n\nComing to Nnamdi Kanu, don\u2019t you think a political situation would be the best solution? You were also incarcerated by Obasanjo.\n\n(Cuts in). I was incarcerated not as someone who was molesting his people.\n\nSo you want him to face justice?\n\nYes\n\nDon\u2019t you think that would be too harsh for him? A political solution would have been ideal to bring peace back to the South-East.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSo what of the people that have suffered and died? Where is the justice for them?\n\nWhat is your view on Sunday Igboho?\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Sunday Igboho. He might be a more honest, humane and considerate person. But Nnnamdi, I know him and I know what he is doing in Igboland. But I don\u2019t know anything about Sunday Igboho.\n\nAt what point did you disagree with Nnamdi Kanu?\n\nKanu said he is a god. He said Biafra is a Jewish State and that there would be no Islam. And I am a Muslim. If he says there would no Islam, he has said he is my enemy. That was how we parted ways. When Obiano was going for a second term, Kanu said there would be no election and I said the election would hold.\n\nWhat is your take on the quality of Ijaw leadership in all ramifications?\n\nI cannot assess the Ijaw leadership now, the reason being that I have not been participating in the activities for some time. I think the President of the Ijaw National Congress is doing well. But I cannot say the same about Ijaw Youth Council. I think that the IYC is dead. We now have a group of people who have turned our council, which we laboured, got injured and died for, into something else. It is terrible. For some of us, we are so pained with it. But what can we do? Majority believes that is what the organisation ought to be. That it should be a money making organisation. That it should be an employment bureau. So that is it.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the National Assembly members who are Ijaws?\n\nThere are few National Assembly members who are Ijaws. They are like a drop in the ocean. And most of them are doing their best. They are in the forefront fighting for the people. But the present leadership of the National Assembly is a rubberstamp, a total rubberstamp.\n\nYou were part of those that agitated for the establishment of the NDDC, but are you not concerned with the current situation?\n\nI am concerned. But as I am concerned, what is the majority view? Many prefer to go and collect peanuts. I don\u2019t want to be involved in all those things again. At times, you come to a realisation that all this while you were working your heart out, the people don\u2019t even acknowledge it. What do Ijaw people want? When Ijaw people make decisions on what they want, then we would all get up. I don\u2019t know what Ijaw people want. I cannot impose my will on Ijaw people on what I want. That would be dictatorial.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Former President Jonathan?\n\nI have seen him several times. We have a very good relationship. Whenever I want to see him, I see him and he treats me well.\n\nSo don\u2019t you think you would need to advise him on this rumoured 2023 Presidency?\n\nI will try and see him. Or rather he should invite me too. I am also a former President of the IYC. If I have not held any other position before, that qualifies me to be an opinion leader in Ijaw land. So if he wants to consult and if he has respect for me, he should call me.\n\nSo if he consults you what are you going to tell him?\n\nI will tell him not to contest. I will tell him that the South- East supported him and this is their turn and so we should join hands together to support a good person from the South- East.\n\nBut some Jonathan supporters believes he was pushed out because of his perceived favourable disposition to the South-East?\n\nJonathan was pushed out because he was too soft for Nigeria. Jonathan is a good man, a good man that did not want to harm anybody. Then people like Olusegun Obasanjo and others kept lying. Where is the list of snipers that Obasanjo talked about? Now he is not talking. Now it is not snipers but you travel on the road and you are kidnapped. Generals are being murdered, traditional rulers are being murdered, clergymen are being murdered; now Obasanjo has lost his voice. God has given Jonathan the position he is in today, let him stay where he is. If Goodluck comes, I would gain more. I might not meet Goodluck to give me something but there are some of my associates that would get into Goodluck\u2019s government, I would walk to them and get things easier than if a South-Easterner is President. But that is not important. I survived six years of Buhari\u2019s government. I did not die. So I can survive eight years of someone who does not know me. I should not take my personal interest above all other peoples. If we are talking about fairness in Nigeria, the people most entitled to the Presidency at this point in time are the South- East. Goodluck and all of us should join hands to support a good person that can bring everybody together and heal the wounds.\n\nSome of you were accused of benefitting immensely from Jonathan and were part of his problem that led to his ouster from the Presidency by turning the government into an Ijaw affair.\n\nJonathan is an Ijaw man. Is Buhari not a Fulani man? Who has accused Buhari? These are people that did not contribute anything. If anything happens in Ijaw land, they would be in the comfort of their homes. Are they better than us? What pedigree do they have? I am Amachree. My father is Justice Melford Goodhead. Have they gone anywhere we have gone? They stay in the comfort of their homes and talk rubbish. Where have they gone to suffer for Goodluck or done anything. Did they go to prison? Did I go to prison as a criminal? Who are they? How did we turn Goodluck into an Ijaw President? When wicked men like Obasanjo were lying, satanic lies, so people should keep quiet because it is Obasanjo? How did we make him Ijaw President? What did Goodluck do for me? I am gaining more now than I gained under Jonathan. I am getting more recognition than I ever got under Jonathan if that would strike you. I am being celebrated more than I was ever celebrated under Goodluck.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Tompolo and other ex-militant leaders?\n\nI am not an ex-militant leader. But I and Tompolo have a very good relationship, because as far as I am concerned, it is just the two of us that are on the same path. The others, I don\u2019t know what they are involved in. I don\u2019t really know what they are involved in. I know Tompolo and he knows me. We interact and have the same ideology, we might disagree in some areas but it is core Ijaw national interest that we stand for. Others, I don\u2019t know what they do or what they stand for. Most of them have confiscated the resources of their communities. They are the Alpha and Omega of controlling the oil resources of their communities. When it comes to standing for Ijaw interest, it is me and Tompolo. Maybe there are others, I don\u2019t have their names.\n\nYou had a running battle with Henry Okah on ideology\n\nYes Henry Okah is not different from Nnamdi Kanu. They are people that want to lead and take complete charge of things. I am not interested in such things. I am not in competition with anybody. As a journalist, you have known me over years. Even when I was fighting, you were in the camp to see me. When I was in the creeks, I allowed you to come. You have always been there. I am not in competition with anybody but I stand by my ideology even if the whole world goes a different way.\n\nRecently, Governor El Rufai said Nigerians should think about merit for the 2023 Presidency. Do you share this view?\n\nSo in Igboland there is no merit? How can El- Rufai evaluate merit? Who is he compared with the avalanche of scholars in Igboland? When Igbos are talking, the quota system too would talk. Is El Rufai competent? He has been in government living off government. It is we that have never been in government that should talk. When you talk about South- East and competent people, you are talking about people that have produced Azikiwe, Prof Dike etc. If Yorubas are talking with Igbos, we know two elephants are talking, not people that rely on quota system.\n\nYou are not known to be a politician, but which party do you have affinity for?\n\nI have an affinity for the Young Progressive Party (YPP).\n\nSo in a way you are rooting for Prof Kingsley Mogalu?\n\nHe is not a member of our party, He left our party. He used our platform and after, he left without anything. He is good riddance to bad rubbish\n\nSo what if he comes back\n\nWe won\u2019t take him. Our party would not take him. He looks down on other people. So who does he want to lead?\n\nPresident Buhari, in his latest interview, said he has done his best for Nigeria. Do you agree?\n\nYes, we knew this was going to be his best. We said it that this was going to be his best. We said it.\n\nHe said he does not expect praise from Nigerians\n\nWe are praising him for doing his best. We said it.",

Accordingly, Forum restates its demand for the fundamental restructuring of the country by enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice. It must be One Nation, One System.\n\n\u201cCites that the northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the office of the presidency of the country for the full statutory period of 8 years by 2023, hence, the presidency should rotate to the South.\n\n\u201cThat any political party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect support from the four regions.\n\n\u201cTherefore, unequivocally, and in full resolve, call on all political parties in the country to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\n\u201cNotes that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also condemned \u201cthe senseless killings of innocent citizens across the country by terrorists and criminals, especially in the North-west zone\u201d and called on the government and security agencies to redouble efforts to safeguard the lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nSMBLF cautioned the National Assembly to only give consideration to Bills that would promote equity, justice, peace and national cohesion, \u201cinstead of issues that will exacerbate conflicts and crises in the country.\u201d\n\nIt urged governors and members of the National Assembly from the four regions to commit themselves to the subject of restructuring and reaffirmed its commitment to the unity of Nigeria, \u201csituated on the tenets of equity, fairness, justice, and the principle of federalism.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held under the chairmanship of its leader and elder statesman, Chief Dr. E.

          "text": "* Begs God to help Nigeria surmount insecurity\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday hosted the Grand Khalifa (overall head) of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement World-Wide, Tidjani Ali Bin Arabi, at the State House, Abuja, and expressed happiness that Arabi and his delegation agreed to come and pray for Nigeria in order to surmount its security crisis.\n\nBuhari expressed optimism that the nation would overcome the security challenges, while also praying to God to hear Nigeria\u2019s prayer for an end to the crisis.\n\nThe President expressed his readiness to take on the terrorists by pursuing policies to eliminate the security issues facing the nation.\n\nBuhari said his administration \u201cis conscious of its responsibility\u201d with regards to security and would continue to do its best.\n\nHe, therefore, urged Nigerians to be fair to his government in assessing the security issues in the country by reflecting on what obtained at the time he took over in 2015, and the successes, as well as the performance that marked a decisive break from the past, particularly in the North-east and the South-south, adding that the North-west, which had given the nation some \u201cheadache\u201d, would soon experience a turnaround for the better.\n\nPresident Buhari also advised Nigerians to take responsibility and show interest in their own security and complement what the government was doing.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have done our best and we will continue to do more by pursuing coherent and consistent policies to deal with terrorism. I hope God will listen to our prayers.\u201d\n\nThe President appreciated the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, who brought the Grand Khalifa to Nigeria, saying:\n\n\u201cWe thank you for inviting them to come to pray for peace and stability in our country. We are grateful that they agreed to come.\u201d\n\nHe joined them in praying that God gives guidance and strength to leaders to be accountable and do right in all the things that they do.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Ganduje, while introducing the Khalifa and his delegation, which included the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, the leader of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement in Nigeria, said the government of Kano State invited the Tijjaniyya World Leader to the country to lead the faithful in prayer, considering the complexities around security in particular.\n\nAccording to him, the visit of the Grand Khalifa had also rekindled the old ties between the Tijjaniya and the many cultural and educational institutions in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, the Tijjaniyya leader in the country, Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi and the Grand Khalifa, Tidjani Ali Bin Arabi extolled the existing cordial relations between Nigeria and Algeria and prayed for guidance and blessings for the country and its leaders.\n\nWhy Kano State Invited Arabi\n\nCommenting on the reason the Kano State Government invited the Grand Khalifa, Ganduje said it was aimed at developing a good relationship between Algeria and the city of Kano.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a kind of rekindling of the relationship because Kano is an old civilization, with so many Ulama (Ismamic scholars) from Algeria hundreds of years ago, who came to Kano to assist the development of Sharia leadership in Kano State.\n\n\u201cSo, the invitation to the world leader of Tijanniyya Islamic Movement is a welcome development for the people of Kano State and for the people of Nigeria. We invited him and his team to pray for Nigeria for peace, stability and prosperity, and also to pray for peace and stability of Kano State and the whole of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the security challenges we\u2019re having at the federal government and state governments levels; we are all doing our best. But praise to Allah subhana wa taala. He will also assist because Allah requested us to request from him, and he can grant us our request. So, as you can see, he was in Kano for four days. We were together until Friday prayers. In the Emir\u2019s Palace, he offered prayers and we had a grand occasion at Sani Abacha Stadium attended by many Ulama from all over Africa, from Nigeria, and from 44 local governments.\n\n\u201cLectures were delivered for peace and stability of this country and also, prayers were offered. Also, we decided to use the Tijanniyya Islamic Movement as a tool for building relationships. We organised a lecture with Bayero University, where we examined the history, the origin and the spread of the movement in Africa.\n\n\u201cAlso in Kano State, we constituted a committee with his team in order to look into issues of education, commerce, and agriculture. So, we have developed a very well-coordinated synergy in order to improve the quality of life of the people of Kano State. And by extension, we offered national prayers for peace and stability of this country.\n\n\u201cTo round it off, we decided to have a courtesy call with Mr. President, where they prayed for him, where they indicated the importance of the relationship between Algeria and Nigeria, and where they indicated their continued cooperation in prayers for peace and stability of Nigeria. That is what brought us to the villa.\u201d\n\nGanduje: Kano Has the Highest Number of Almajiri\n\nGanduje also stated yesterday that his state has the highest number of Almajiri children among the Northern states in the country.\n\nHe, however, stressed that most of the Almajiri, who are in millions, were not citizens of Kano State but from other states and neighbouring countries like Niger and Mali.\n\nThe governor, who spoke with newsmen at the State House, Abuja after meeting with President Buhari, said necessary steps were being taken by the state\u2019s government to resolve the Almajiri issue.\n\nAccording to him, the measures include introduction of compulsory free education up to secondary level, reformation of the Almajiri system of education in the state and repatriation of some Almajiris to neighbouring Cameroun and Niger Republic.\n\nGanduje said: \u201cBut as you will know, unless there\u2019s a universal legislation, preventing the movement of school-aged children from one state to another, it is a problem that will continue to be here for a long time because Kano is a commercial nerve centre of the Northern part of this country and also a commercial nerve centre of some West African countries.\n\n\u201cSo, you can imagine people coming to earn their livelihood. They usually come with children, but we have enacted a law, any parent that does not put his child into school will be prosecuted. So, now, we have established a whole agency that is now evacuating the Almajiri to their respective states. And those who are in Kano enjoy the free education facilities.\n\n\u201cThat is the effort we are making. But as I told you, unless there is universal synergy, especially among the Northern states\u2019 governors, where there is legislation preventing the movement of Almajiri from one state to another, Kano will continue to bear this problem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) has condemned the killing of 13 people in some communities in Tal, Banganje and Kalmai Districts in Billiri Local Government Area of Gombe State by suspected herdsmen.\n\nThe group in a statement issued yesterday by its Spokesman, Rwang Pam, berated the state Governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, saying his silence was a sign of nonchalance and disdain towards the loss of innocent lives of those he swore to protect.\n\nAccording to the group, the failure of security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of these killings is a clear sign of the governor\u2019s nonchalance.\n\nSaMBA therefore appealed to the conscience of members of the security agencies to fish out these killer-herdsmen in Southern Gombe.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the killings in Southern Gombe by suspected Fulani herdsmen these past three weeks and the deafening silence from the Executive Governor of the state, Inuwa Yahaya. As the governor is aware, these attacks occurred just one week after an Intelligence Report by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence (NSDC) was leaked to the public, that Fulani herdsmen had a secret meeting within Yamaltu terrain in Yamaltu -Deba Local Area and shared kola nut among themselves in preparation for the attack on the aforementioned locations in Billiri Local Government Area. Following this leak, Samuel Wabulari, the Gombe State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, quickly denied the viral memo which suggested that Fulani herders had prepared to launch an attack on Billiri Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cIt is of grave concern that few days after that memo was leaked to the public, attacks were carried out in Tal, Banganje and Kalmai Districts, Billiri LGA, Southern Gombe State by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Based on reports received so far, the names of the 13 people killed in Billiri communities are Paul Ambore, Titus Marwa (Kolokkwannin Village); Nitte Kada, Zayo (Ayaba Village); Ibrahim Alhamis, Nitte Buba (Poshulte Village); Silas Shirwa (Pokuli Village); Nadab Na\u2019aman (Prison Service officer on Christmas break, Popandi village); Biryam Jeji, Buba Akadaya, Jacob Piyau Kwakbente, RSM Jonathan Dale (rtd) (Kalmai District) and Samaila Daulu Banganje District. Those injured were Salom Gideon, Samkong Samuel Bataliya, Julius Samuel, Paris Bitrus, Baba Lamido Kwarau, and Richard Iliya.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop SaMBA is gravely concerned regarding the silence, the inaction and nonchalance of the Executive Governor of Gombe State to the killings going on in Billiri Local Government Area. The governor should be called to order; his attitude is not in sync with conduct expected of anyone occupying the highest office of Gombe State. There is no doubt that the governor has failed in his constitutional duties to protect innocent lives and properties of the Gombe people. He is making the situation worse by failing to condole with the family of the victims and people of Gombe State, the least expected of the occupier of the highest office in the State. The governor\u2019s omission is an act of negligence and dereliction of duty. The Inuwa Yahaya-led government must perform its primary duty of protecting the lives and properties of the people of Gombe. He must also provide immediate relief to the affected communities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But you sent a message across to me and I was delighted to host you in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cWe lost two traditional rulers almost in quick succession. First, it was Soun of Ogbomoso land, and we were planning for the burial when the Olubadan of Ibadanland also joined his ancestors. We were still in the middle of that when former governor Akala also died. I can see that in Oyo state, we try to take politics out of what we call \u2018omoluabi\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe may fight, struggle for political positions but we know power can only come from God and He gives it to whomever He will like to give it to at whatever time.\n\n\u201cWe really thank you for this visit and want to let you know that we have taken proper notice that you have risen above politics and all that is going around here to come and share with us at this moment that we are grieving. We say thank you.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to wish you well in your political quest to govern this nation.

First, it was Soun of Ogbomoso land, and we were planning for the burial when the Olubadan of Ibadanland also joined his ancestors.

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Technext held the maiden edition of Technext Coinference, a cryptocurrency and blockchain event, in Lagos, Nigeria. Barely a month later, some of the discussions at the event are becoming very key crypto and blockchain innovations to look out for in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event kicked off with a keynote by the Nigerian Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nEven though the Nigerian government has not been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies, Agba made some interesting comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He mentioned use cases for blockchain that could turn the tides in some sectors of the country.\n\nStoring land as NFTs\n\nThe Minister said blockchain technology \u201copens up numerous possibilities for optimisation in our current systems across industries. And could be the biggest disruptor in finance and governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting how blockchain could be harnessed to store real estate information, he said, \u201cin real estate and trade, we can harness blockchain to create and store all lands in their base units of a plot as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u201d\n\nThis could go a long way in tracking the historical ownership of land on the blockchain. People can own lands and list them for sale the same way they own art on OpenSea, Rarible, and other NFT marketplaces.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nA piece of land has to be tokenised, just like artworks, collectables, and music. Information about the land will be included, and it will be uploaded (minted) on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to Finextra, tokenising real estate could also mean that several people can own a property together, giving more people without the financial wherewithal the opportunity to invest in real estate.\n\nOwning real estate outside the country would also be possible. Buying a house in another country could be as easy as shopping online. Once a property is listed on a marketplace with all the necessary information stored on a blockchain, ownership details go to the buyer. And with the help of smart contracts, third parties would not be needed.\n\nWhile these sound very interesting, Agba believes regulation still has to be put in place.\n\n\u201cTo have a fruitful conversation about the regulation of any industry, it is first important to have an understanding of the structure of governance overseeing the industry .\u201d\n\nThis, however, remains a challenge. The Minister said there is the question of who has the power to regulate cryptocurrency, a decision that can only be reached based on how cryptocurrency is classified \u2014 as a security, currency, or an asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto and naira will work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO and Buchi Okoro, Quidax CEO.

However, Buchi Okoro, CEO of crypto exchange, Quidax, doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really had the thought that Bitcoin would replace the naira. I believe that it is supposed to be a collaborative system where crypto works with local currencies to make life better for everybody,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nHe believes fiat currencies will continue to be relevant to finance the same way digital communication will not replace physical communication; they will work together to enhance each other.\n\nOne area crypto will enhance fiat currencies is cross border transactions. This use case has been one of the earliest for cryptocurrencies. A trader in Nigeria, for instance, can swiftly pay his Chinese counterpart with crypto.\n\nOne of the conventional methods of cross border transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Transactions on it take up to four days to be completed. Sending via crypto takes a significantly less amount of time with lower fees.\n\nSocial media is going to the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, NFT, and Web3 were some of the biggest buzzwords of 2021 in the crypto sphere. When social media giant, Facebook, changed its name to Meta, the metaverse got even more attention, and according to Forbes, it is a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.\n\nDuring a panel session at the Technext Coinference, Okoro said, \u201ca lot of engagements that will happen in the future will happen in the metaverse. The things we do on Twitter and Instagram will be done in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will change the way we interact and how we live day-to-day life. Life as we know it could move to a virtual world. Digital platforms already play a vital role in many aspects of human life.\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, did not say Meta\u2019s social media platforms will be turned into a metaverse, he did say, \u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.\u201d\n\nLike most innovations, the metaverse is still at the very early stages, and only a few people have experienced it. But with the commercial perks cited by Forbes, more investments could go into the metaverse, and we could subsequently see it go mainstream.\n\nSolana is the blockchain to watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, Patricia CEO. Source: Technext\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, CEO of alternative payments solution company, Patricia, has indicated an interest in the Solana blockchain, which has been touted as the Ethereum killer.\n\nDuring his keynote address titled, Blockchain for Africa: The endless possibilities, Abodje pointed out how blockchain could disrupt African systems making them secure and more effective.\n\nWhen asked about the interesting platforms on which to build blockchain solutions, Abodje unequivocally pointed out Solana, saying it\u2019s one blockchain that should be paid a lot of attention.\n\nSolana is a decentralised blockchain platform founded in 2017. The chain has been praised for its fast transaction speed of over 2000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin that are only capable of about 15 transactions per second.\n\nDespite the rapid transaction speed, the fees are very low, with an average cost per transaction of $000.25.\n\nFast transactions and low fees aren\u2019t the only things that make Solana a blockchain to watch. It brings ease and simplicity to using crypto platforms, reducing the financial barrier of participating in activities such as NFTs and decentralised finance (DeFI).\n\nAfrican NFT project, Afrobubble, was created on the Solana blockchain because of the ease the chain brings to buying and selling NFTs.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, worldwide adoption jumped over 880%, with Nigeria and Kenya among the top ten countries with the highest adoption rate. If this trend continues, we could see some of these projections come true in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This is because Twitter, the microblogging platform, has agreed to some conditions that must be met before the end of March 2022.\n\nSome of the conditions are:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter must register as a company in Nigeria\n\nIt must appoint a country representative to serve as a liaison between the company and the federal government\n\nIt must enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals\n\nIt must comply with Nigerian tax obligations on its operations.\n\nHave we seen this before? Yes. In India, under the guise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government had ordered suspended in 2021. This, among other things, caused Twitter to clash with the Indian government.\n\nLater that year, however, Twitter agreed to all government conditions imposed due to a lawsuit.\n\nBut now, in Nigeria, why would Twitter agree to some of the conditions imposed by the federal government? I\u2019m quite worried. Do you believe they stood to lose if they didn\u2019t compromise? Isn\u2019t this agreement cause for alarm?\n\nI think now is the right time to go over this again: #TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?\n\nMost importantly, what does this mean for Nigerians and the federal government in the future?\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole answered my questions and probably some of yours in this article: #Twitterban update: A precedent for future shutdowns?\n\nLipa Later\u2019s $12 million pre-Series A\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nKenyan Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) startup, Lipa Later, has raised $12 million in pre-Series A to expand into Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania.\n\nThe round saw participation from Cauris Finance, Lateral Frontiers VC, GreenHouse Capital, SOSV IV LLC, Sayani Investments, and Axian Financial Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Eric Muli and Michael Maina, the company allows retailers to sell goods and services to consumers in affordable monthly instalments.\n\nMoreso, the company\u2019s product offering allows for both online and offline integration with retailers and both online and offline sales platforms, including mobile wallets for consumers.\n\nThe company, which already exists in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda, claims it has built a reputation for delivering value for its investors right from its early days. Also, it has exclusive partnerships with retailers across their current markets, allowing shoppers to pay for products in instalments.\n\nFintech Farm\u2019s $7.4 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Techcrunch\n\nA UK-based fintech startup, Fintech Farm, that creates digital banks in emerging markets, has raised $7.4 million in seed funding to launch neobanks in 8 countries over the next 24 months.\n\nWhile Flyer One Ventures and Solid led the seed round, TA Ventures, Jiji, u.ventures and AVentures Capital participated.\n\nFounded by Dmytro Dubilet, Nick Bezkrovnyy, and Alexander Vityaz, Fintech Farm takes a different approach to the traditional model used by the country\u2019s neobanks, which prefer to hold their banking license and offer the full range of financial services themselves.\n\nInterestingly, Fintech Farm\u2019s main product is a card that functions as a debit card and a credit card with a loan facility attached in the customer\u2019s name. The app\u2019s features include a savings account, deposits, and transfers.\n\nWhy should you care? The company plans to enter eight emerging markets in Africa and Asia, the first of which will be Nigeria, before the end of March 2022.\n\n\u201cOur next market is going to be Nigeria, we have visited Nigeria a couple of times already, and it is one of our favourite countries,\u201d said Dubilet, adding that the launch will likely take place in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile entering Nigeria may increase competition among the country\u2019s neobanks, the company\u2019s plan to use credit cards to provide cheaper and more accessible credit appears shaky.\n\nWith the West African country lacking a sophisticated credit bureau system to detail people\u2019s credit histories, it is unclear how Fintech Farm will operate using credit cards.\n\nBut Dubilet is optimistic, citing the company\u2019s data science teams, which he describes as \u201cone of the best in the world,\u201d to perform some magic.\n\nWhat /I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nCrazily high valuations, investor FOMO, the ripple effects of Y Combinator\u2019s new deal.

From the details of the agreement, the microblogging platform has agreed to some conditions which must be fulfilled before Q1 2022 ends.\n\nTwitter has shown a willingness to register as a company in Nigeria, appoint a country representative to act as a liaison between the company and the Federal Government. In addition to enrolling Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, the company has also agreed to applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\nUsers\u2019 reactions\n\nSince the announcement\u2026\n\nWe are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria.

Going by recent cases, it is commonplace to find these organisations severely sanctioned for violating rules with grey areas.\n\nLocal telecommunications companies are unlikely to push back when orders clearly violating citizens\u2019 fundamental right of access to information are given. Ordinarily, this does not apply to social media sites because they are not under their jurisdiction.\n\nEven though it seems the company might be giving the government too much discretionary power, it chose to negotiate rather than go the litigation route, as was the case in India.\n\nA flawed precedent?\n\nIf any other country has given Twitter a hard time, it\u2019s India. The repression started early in 2021 when, on the premise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government gave the order to deactivate or suspend. Asides from that, the company failed to comply with the country\u2019s IT rules. In the months that followed, Twitter ran into more problems with the government, leading to the police visiting the company\u2019s office in India to serve a notice.\n\nBy July, Twitter agreed to comply with all government conditions following a legal suit fully. The court directed Twitter to issue a statement saying it intends to abide by the rules.\n\nIndia made a scapegoat of Twitter, which became an example for other Big Tech companies. As the government argued, Twitter has lost legal immunity for users\u2019 posts in India. Could this be the Nigerian government\u2019s plan?\n\nIf anything, strong-arming is common with governments that have shown authoritarian traits in the past and global company compliance might only fuel it.\n\nFar from over: Possible tales of \u2018once again\u2019\n\nWhile China is considered the region with the strictest Internet shutdowns, Africa is often regarded as the most volatile environment for social media. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s history of Internet shutdowns dates back to 2007 with Guinea, and it was only a matter of time before other countries followed suit, with Nigeria joining the trend in 2020.\n\nCurrently, 32 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries have restricted access to the Internet for similar reasons ranging from protests to strikes. Elections, national security, and examinations also present opportunities for restrictions. Specifically, shutdowns have proven to be one of the government\u2019s tools to control information and communication.\n\nIt thus appears that a successful Internet shutdown in a country might result in many more. Ethiopia, for instance, has had 12 Internet shutdowns, and as of 2020, Chad had accumulated almost two and a half years of Internet disruptions within five years.\n\nWhile circumventing social media censorship with VPNs appears to be the easiest way out, the issue of privacy and free speech are still cause for worry. Only time will tell if there will be more cases.\n\nhttps://techpoint.africa/2021/02/26/sub-; there-africa-internet-shutdown-loses/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane has differed with comments made by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed that Nigeria has a revenue problem and not an expenditure problem.\n\nAt the public presentation of the approved 2022 budget, Ahmed had decried the falling revenue of the Federal Government which has been compounded by erstwhile declining oil prices at the heights of the Covid-19 pandemic and as a consequence, the eventual shrinking of the Nigerian economy following the 2020 recession.\n\nShe followed up earlier forewarnings given to Nigerians to expect to pay more tax with actual amendments made to the Finance Act resulting in changes made to tax laws and in particular the addition of new taxes like the Sugar Tax which imposes a N10 VAT per litre on all consumed non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages even as the focus of the government is now geared towards opening up strata of new revenue generation sources to support the execution of the 2022 budget.\n\nNotwithstanding a 97.5 percent increase in the actual oil price to $79.31 per barrel recorded at the end of 2021 from a $40 oil price benchmark in appropriated 2021 budget, oil revenue fell 47.4 percent from that expected at the start of the year. This accounted for the bulk of the 74 percent decrease in expected Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s Aggregate revenue which was N5.51 trillion as of November 2021.\n\nThe Minister while presenting the budget assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari, barring a pending amendment and/or virement request to be made to the National Assembly, had noted that the Federal Government\u2019s share of oil revenues was N970.3 billion representing a 53 percent performance of the prorated sum in the 2021 budget.\n\nRead also: Oil prices to decline in 2022, 2023 \u2013 EIA\n\nQuite notably, however, of all the Federal government revenue generation sources, only the Minerals and Mining, customs, Companies Income Tax (CIT), and Value Added Tax (VAT) revenue sources that comprised the non-oil revenue were viable. The federal government\u2019s share of this revenue source totalled N1.62 trillion representing a 118.8 percent over and above target.\n\n\u201cCompanies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N718.58 billion and N360.56 billion, representing 115 percent and 165 percent respectively of the prorated targets for the period.\u201d Mrs Ahmed clarified during her presentation.\n\nRewane, therefore, finds it ironical that the federal government will have a revenue generation problem only.\n\nCommenting on the statement of the Minister at the Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) 2022 Economic Outlook held on Thursday, Rewane stated that \u201cin addition to a revenue generation problem, there is a revenue management problem.\u201d He berated the government for the inability to save for the rainy days, allocate and put into productive uses the extra revenue generated by the economy even in times of wants.\n\nThis is as the Minister also disclosed plans to reduce the size of government\u2019s annual recurrent expenditure by cutting down on the workforce with fears in some quarters that this will exacerbate the current unemployment situation in the country which stands at 33 percent as of Quarter 4 2020 according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS)\n\n\u201cThere is a special committee, led by the SGF that is working on the review of agencies, with a view to collapsing them partly using the Oransanye Report. At the end of it, what we want to do is to reduce the size of government and also to reduce the size of personnel cost and part of it will be designing the exit packages that are realistic.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ahmed, the basis for the proposed cut down of the workforce was the dwindling revenue situation of the government. \u201cWe are revenue challenged. So everything we do, we can\u2019t put an exit package if you are not willing to cash it immediately. So, when you are asking people to exit by choice, you must be able to give them that package as they are exiting\u201d. She noted.",

          "text": "Apart from the coronavirus outbreak which adversely impacted the business activities of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, several government policies constituted a major setback to their operations and growth in the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nAccording to the 2020 National Survey of MSMEs report, released by Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in collaboration with the National Bureau of Statistics, high fuel price, high taxes, high electricity tariff and high interest rate and insecurity led to a compulsory shut down of over 1. 8 million Enterprises across the country.\n\nThe Survey which was conducted in all the 36 States of the Federation and FCT, covered enterprises in Nigeria employing below 200 persons (i.e. nano, micro, small and medium enterprises \u2013 MSMEs) and aims to generate up to date data on MSMEs with a view to determining the effect of the recent socio-economic development as well as global occurrences like Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nDetails of the report obtained by BusinessDay shows that the total number of MSMEs as at December, 2020 stood at 39,654,385, with total assets valued at N8.41 trillion.\n\nA breakdown of the value showed that Non-residential building accounted for the highest value (N5.6 trillion) representing 66.9 percent, followed by residential buildings at N1.8 trillion (21.1 percent), while office Furniture 55.3 billion (0.7 percent) recorded the least.\n\nSimilarly, a breakdown of the total number of MSMEs showed that micro enterprises were 38, 413,420, while small and medium enterprises were 1,240,965.\n\nRead Also: GIZ, Edo empower 445 MSMEs with digital marketing skills\n\n\u201cThe 2020 National NMSME Survey Report revealed a significant shrink in the total number of NMSMEs in Nigeria from 41.5 million in 2017 to 39.6 mlllion in 2020, representing a 4.5% decrease.\n\n\u201cIn addition to government\u2019s unfavorable policies, other reasons for the drop in the number of NMSMEs cannot be totally divorced from the open global competitiveness that has had negative impacts on the NMSMEs and also the worsening case of insecurity,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, the COVID 19 pandemic also had a great impact on MSMEs nationwide as most SMEs (53.2 percent) were temporarily closed while 37.3 percent of MEs were permanently closed.\n\nCommenting in the report, Statistician-General of the Federation, Simon Harry stressed the importance of MSMEs to the growth of the economy which is evidenced by its contributions to the Nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment and exports over the years.\n\nHarry, however regretted that in spite of the contribution of the sector to economic growth, there are still challenges hindering its rapid growth and development and key among them is the dearth of robust, timely and reliable data on MSMEs.\n\n\u201cIt was in attempt to address this problem that the fourth round of MSMEs was conducted nation-wide so as to generate up to date data on MSMEs with a view to determining the effect of the recent socio-economic development as well as global occurrences like Covid 19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nDikko Umaru Radda, Director General/Chief Executive of SMEDAN, in his remark stressed on the need for more collective and sustained actions aimed at creating the enabling environment for NMSMEs especially in the areas of funding, compliance, infrastructure, technology and markets.\n\nHe said the new survey was necessitated by the need to provide realistic, robust and useful data to economic planners given that the previous reports in 2010, 2013 and 2017, had been outdated.\n\nRadda said, \u201cThis is an area that the agency has been assiduously working on to address even in the face of dwindling resources.\u201d\n\nHe said the absence of data that clearly profile NMSMEs or adequately explain the peculiar challenges they face in their operating environment, had been a major source of worry to SMEDAN.\n\nApart form businesses that were shut down, the sectors contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)declined. This is despite a marginal increase of 3.7 percent in the sector\u2019s employment within the period, there was however a decrease of 3.5 percent in the contribution to GDP in 2020 compared to 2017.\n\nAlso identified as a problem was the financial challenges faced by MSMEs, which was reported to be workers\u2019 wages and social security charges and rent.\n\nStates with the highest distribution of business enterprises in Nigeria are Lagos State (91,097 entities), Rivers State (84,613 entities) and Kano State (79,328 entities), while, states with the least number of enterprises were Bayelsa State (15,758 entities) and Kebbi State (17,305 entities).",

          "title": "Why UK Scholarships to Nigerians is rising",
          "text": "Nigerians are now becoming an important asset to the United Kingdom (UK), especially its universities as the developed country has become more lenient in opening its borders to them.\n\nAccording to Information from the UK\u2019s immigration statistics government, in the top five nationalities, Nigerian nationals saw the largest increase of 368 percent in sponsored study grants compared in September 2021 from 7,860 in the same period of 2019.\n\nLikewise in terms of visas issued to the UK, Nigeria recorded a rise of 234.7 percent to 18,580 in the first nine months of 2021 from 5,551 in the same period of 2019.\n\nIn March last year, the UK government issued a Graduate Route post-study work visa. The visa helps bachelors and masters graduates to be able to live and work in the country for up to two years, while Ph.D. Graduates can live and work for up to three years.\n\nHere are five reasons why the UK is scouting for NigeriansBright TalentsNigeria is known to have a high intellectual capacity and this has reflected in the UK, where many in a highly-educated diaspora work in financial services, Information Technology, and the legal and medical professions.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria sees the largest increase in UK scholarships\n\nSome Nigerian outstanding individuals such as Oluyinka Olutoye, Joseph Ladapo, Njideka Udochi, Onyema Ogbuagu among others have worked hard to distinguish themselves and have earned the respect of their contemporaries in countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia, Europe among others.\n\nFor example, in 2016, Olutoye, a renowned foetal and pediatric surgeon successfully operated on a baby-in-utero. For this groundbreaking feat, he was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in the US. He now leads one of the largest children\u2019s hospital surgery departments in the world.\n\nLikewise, in the literary field, 10-year-old Nigerian twins made waves in the UK United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2018, Hills and Wills Nwokedi, authored Dominik\u2019s Diaries (Grandma: Desperate Measures), a book written to inspire other children. The book has gained popularity in the UK.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s intellectual capacity makes it attractive to offer scholarships because their good result makes the schools in the UK look good, thereby making them get more funding and be more popular,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered Recruitment and Training Consultancy said.\n\nCheap LaborNigeria has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world. An average government worker earns $73 per month; this is lower than its African peers such as Morocco ($310), South Africa ($277), Ethiopia ($144) and Egypt ($174).\n\nThe country\u2019s low wage is often tagged as a non-living wage as it is not enough to meet the basic needs of people thereby affecting their standard of living.\n\nAlthough this may be a disadvantage to the country, the reverse is the case for the UK looking for cheap labour.\n\nLarge working PopulationNigeria\u2019s population of over 200 million is the most populated in Africa and it has been projected by the United Nations to become the world\u2019s third-largest population of 410 million by 2050.\n\nIts working population is also estimated to be more than double, while other developed countries would have reduced their working population.\n\nAccording to data from the population estimates and projections from US Census Bureau International Data Base (IDB), the estimated working age (15-64) population of Nigeria will increase by 120.8 percent in 2050, while the UK will increase marginally by three percent.\n\nOther countries like South Korea, Japan, Spain, Germany, China, Russia and Italy will reduce by 27.3 percent, 26.3 percent, 25.4 percent, 21.0 percent, 19 percent, 18.3 percent and 14.4 percent respectively.\n\nBrexitThe withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU) on 31 January 2020 (Brexit) made many businesses move their headquarters to the EU.The impact slowed its economy, causing some impact on jobs. Employers are having a harder time finding applicants. This has hit the low-skilled and medium-skilled occupations the most.\n\n\u201cBrexit created job vacancies at the middle and low level. So they need to fill those positions and Nigerians are usually the ones that fill those areas,\u201d Olugbenga Ogunbode, the chief executive officer at International Education Corporation Group said.\n\nHigh Diaspora RemittanceThe Nigerian diaspora community acts as an important asset in bilateral relations and development efforts.\n\nWorld Bank data shows that in 2018, the Nigerian diaspora in the UK transferred over \u00a32.8 billion in remittance payments to Nigeria, accounting for one percent of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\n\u201cThis figure alone illustrates the economic weight the UK-based Nigerian diaspora holds both in the UK and in Nigeria,\u201d the World Bank states.",

          "text": "Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company, Mr Bismarck Rewane has projected Nigeria\u2019s financial services industry to grow by 8.32 per cent in 2022, going by the increased partnership and collaborations by Fintechs in promoting financial inclusion.\n\nRewane who spoke in a keynote address at the Nigerian Economic Outlook 2022 webinar organised by First Bank of Nigeria Ltd. on Thursday in Lagos, hinged the predictions on increased partnership and collaborations by Fintechs in promoting financial inclusion.\n\nHe added that there would be rationalisation and drift within the industry, stressing that Tier 1 banks would leverage their robust customer base and balance sheet size.\n\nAccording to him, there would be aggressive digital innovation and lending solutions as a well as possible mergers and acquisitions within and across tiers to boost capital structure.\n\nRewane said the manufacturing sector would likely grow by 4.70 per cent in 2022, while predicting that improved foreign exchange liquidity and increased product innovation would boost the sector\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cPlayers would benefit from volume and value growth. Top players (Nestle Nigeria and Unilever) will report profit growth of 20 per cent in 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cAgriculture sector is likely to grow by 1.6 per cent in 2022, an efficient rail system will ease logistics constraints and boost productivity.\n\nRewane added that the ICT industry would likely to grow by 9.72 per cent in 2022 with telephone penetration on the rise.\n\n\u201cThere will be surge in Fintech and mobile payments, while increased level of activities will be supported by 5G operations, the sector will consolidate within the year,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, telecom infrastructure will expand with cable acquistion. He noted that the nation\u2019s economic performance would be largely determined by the successful implementation of the 2022 budget and the newly approved five-year development plan.\n\nHe explained that the declining inflation would be positive for consumer purchasing power, adding that monetary tightening in advanced economies could trigger capital outflows.\n\nHe also said oil price would remain relatively stable, adding that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth would be sublime.\n\nAccording to him, in 2022, competition between traditional banks and Fintechs will intensify, while banks with constant innovation and regional diversification will remain resilient.\n\nHe further noted that reform could be impeded by political considerations and labour union activities within the year, saying that insecurity could prove tricky to contain and would become a political campaign tool for the opposition.\n\nRewane also said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would likely increase foreign exchange suppy to manufacturers to ease currency pressures.\n\nRewane stressed that pre-election spending would be positive for aggregate demand and would as well boost corporate performance.\n\nOn the exchange rate outlook he said, the CBN would likely step up efforts towards exchange rate convergence.\n\nHe also noted that political jitters would heighten foreign demand pressures in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nOn the risk matrix in 2022, he listed policy reversal and delayed reforms, heightened social unrest spurred by high unemployment and poverty levels and financial sector crisis, among others as things to watch out for.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, Chief Executive Officer, FirstBank, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, said the webinar provided the opportunity to assess the performance of the Nigerian economy across key indices in 2021 and benefit from expert opinions on the expectations and forecast for 2022.\n\nAdeduntan said it would also provide excellent insights on the key factors that would shape both the global and local economic landscape in 2022.\n\nHe noted that in 2021 global outputs rebounded and recovery was strong following improved vaccination efforts, as well as support from the monetary and fiscal authorities.\n\nAccording to him, the fourth wave of COVID-19 omicron variant created some level of caution, impacting the activities of the fourth quarter of 2021 and leading to the push for booster jabs and reinstatement of COVID protocols.\n\nAccording to him, specific key lessons can be gleaned from the economic and related activities of 2021.\n\nHe noted that these lessons and other expected occurrences in 2022 were vital ingredients to the planning processes of the bank\u2019s esteemed customers and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs a Bank, we have a legacy of supporting the growth of businesses as the engine for economic growth and development in Nigeria and across Sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n\u201cIn line with our renewed vision \u2018to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice,\u2019 FirstBank will take the lead in driving the development of the different sectors and industries within the economies where we operate to support overall economic growth and sustainability.\n\n\u201cAs a bank that is woven into the fabric of society, this webinar is further reinforcing our support and collaboration with stakeholders as we demonstrate our commitment and willingness to be the partner of first choice to our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hoped that at the end of the webinar, participants would have gained valuable insights into the global and local economic direction.\n\nHe said the participants would as well understand how to strategically position their businesses and personal endeavours to harness the opportunities that would arise all through the year, NAN reported.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Okafor Ofiebor/Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has called on President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria to redouble efforts in fulfilling his cardinal electoral promise of securing the country.\n\nSpeaking during the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Ceremony in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Governor Wike said Nigeria is at the crossroads and everyone is weary about the prolonged Boko Haram insurgency in parts of the country.\n\nAccording to Governor, there is also the unbridled killings by the bandits and the increasing insecurity in most parts of the country with members of the armed forces made to pay the price of containing these internal wars continuously.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that some progress has been made in the fight against the insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, the generality of Nigerians believes that the progress made can\u2019t be good enough insofar as Boko haram, its affiliates and the bandits are still active in the North-East, North-West and some other parts of the country, killing, maiming and kidnapping helpless people, including school children, and destroying and displacing hapless communities.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, call on Mr President to redouble his efforts and fulfill his cardinal electoral promise to secure the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe and remain safe and secure wherever they are in their own country.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike pointed to the need for the Federal Government to take as top priority the equipping of the nation\u2019s armed forces appropriately.\n\nThis, he noted, will motivate men and officers of the military to be well poised to accomplish the noble task of securing the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe within their various communities.\n\n\u201cWe also count on our armed forces to quickly end the raging insurgency and restore peace and hope to all our distressed people and communities who bear the physical, emotional and psychological scars of war and destruction.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Governor Wike stated that officers and men of the armed forces are enduring symbols of national unity.\n\nHe said, Nigerians are proud of them for their principled loyalty to the nation, including their capacity and commitment to defend Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, democracy and constitutional freedoms of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is also significant to appreciate that, for several families across the nation and communities, today\u2019s remembrance ceremony is a very painful reminder of the loved ones that they lost years, months and even barely weeks ago.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, granting consent for a loved one to enlist in the armed forces knowing that he or she may die in the service, remains one of the toughest decisions any parent, guardian or spouse can make.\n\n\u201cBut they did and gave their loved ones to the service of the nation; for the love of our nation; and for the peace and security of their people.\n\n\u201cWhat they did is therefore a great and inspiring lesson in courage and selflessness, for which we owe them all the possible debt of gratitude, respect and honour.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike stated that Nigeria has been at war for over ten years and that has kept the armed forces seriously engaged in offensive combat against terrorists groups like Boko Haram, the Islamic State of West Africa Province, and bandits.\n\nThese terrorists groups, Governor Wike remarked, are fanatically bent on destroying Nigeria in vain pursuit of their devilish social, economic and religions agendas.\n\nGovernor Wike said, in all these wars and violent conflicts, whether within or outside the nation\u2019s shores, members of the Nigerian armed forces are and have been the primary victims.\n\n\u201cWhile most survived to tell their stories about the horrors of war and conflicts; some inevitably paid the ultimate price, while some others survived with horrific bodily wounds and scares.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike, therefore, has pledged that the Rivers State Government will continue to identify with them and support their families to cushion their pains. He donated N50million as support fund that will help widow of the fallen heroes to have something to do to eke a living\n\nIn his speech, Rivers State Chairman of Nigerian Legion, ACG Justice Chichi said the Nigerian Legion in the State has received all the financial donations made on the day of emblem launch for the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration.\n\nHe described the support from the Governor Wike and the Rivers State Government towards the success of the event and their welfare as extra ordinary show of kindness.\n\nEarlier, at the Isaac Adaka Boro Park, Governor Wike inspected the guard of honour mounted by men of the security agencies. He later laid the wreath at the feet of the unknown soldier.\n\nSome of those who also laid wreath included the Deputy Governor Ipalibo Harry Banigo, Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikunyi-Owaji Ibani and Chief Judge of Rivers State, Justice Simeon Chibuzor Amadi with the General Officer Commanding 6 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Sani Mohammed, leading other military commanders to lay wreaths.\n\nGovernor Wike also released pigeons as a mark of peace for the event.\n\nThere were prayers said by Military Chaplains and Military Imam for the personnel of the Nigerian Armed Forces and the ex-servicemen\n\nA 21-gun salute was shot in honour of deceased ex-servicemen.",

          "title": "2023: Leaders North must reject, vote for \u2013 Ex-INEC scribe",
          "text": "Ahead of 2023, Northerners have been urged to reject corupt politicians currently seeking to buy power at all levels and vote for competent, honest and visionary candidates, who will not buy or steal power.\n\nFormer Secretary of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and spokesman of Northern Elders Forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed, who made the call on Saturday, said the North, just like Nigeria, has suffered from poverty, insecurity and economy decline that has forced many elders and leaders with integrity into silence, while the youth have been left frustrated and hopeless with no direction forcing some of them into thuggery, banditry and other vices.\n\nAddressing the Meeting of Northern Leaders of Though on Saturday at Arewa House, Dr. Hakeem said the next Nigerian president must be the best candidate with integrity, honesty, ability to take the country out of the woods in the shortest possible time, and with a team from across the country ready to deliver irrespective of his tribe, religion and party affiliation.\n\n\u201cThe North needs a major shift in its elite selection processes, which will allow it to put into power, competent, honest and visionary leaders at all levels. What this means is that the overwhelming majority of politicians warming up in our major parties to take over and continue business as usual should be roundly rejected, and others who will not have to buy or steal power because they have credibility and evidence of some integrity will be voted in by voters who will resist the temptation to sell votes for less than a meal.\n\n\u201cThe imperative of affecting major changes in the quality of leadership starting from the 2023 elections is beyond question. This is why the North should support major amendments of the electoral process, and improvements in the capacities of INEC to reduce rigging and vote-buying and violence.\n\n\u201cA Northerner should be voted President only if he is the best. Being Northerner is not enough. All Nigerians need good leaders, but for us in the North, we will demand to see evidence that a candidate does not just want power to fulfill a personal ambition. We want to see evidence that those who want to lead us in future understand the roots of, and solutions to our insecurity and poverty and distances from each other.\n\n\u201cGroups and associations have raised voices on insecurity, poverty and the damaging decline of the economy of the North and the setbacks in relations between communities that make up Nigeria, many Northern elders and leaders with personal integrity and other qualities who should stand up to be counted have largely retreated into the discomfort of silence.\n\n\u201cYounger Northerners are angry, frustrated and alienated, with virtually no linkages with elders and leaders, unless they are hired thugs in the service of politicians. Many others are criminals, bandits, informers or kidnappers exploiting the weaknesses of the state, or at margins of hopelessness in a country that they believe promises a lot and delivers nothing.\n\n\u201cSir Ahmadu Bello, fell to bullets from cowardly murderers in these very premises. The people who killed him simultaneously launched Nigeria into a different and negative trajectory from which it has not recovered. Today, we can speak as three or four generations of Northerners who have seen the best and now live in the worst of the North. We can lament the loss of great opportunities, but we will also support each other to find the strengths and the courage to ask the right questions and find the right answers.\n\n\u201cWe have wasted enough lives, blood, energy and resources blaming leaders who have reaped hugely from our misfortunes and injuries. It is enough. We have no one else to cry to; no one to look up to, to lead us out of terror and poverty and no one willing to use their positions to turn the fortunes of the North around. We may be facing unprecedented challenges, but these are times to prepare to find extraordinary strengths and assets so that our children will be rid of the current nightmares which are our lives today.\n\n\u201cWe have voted people into power who have either turned their backs at us, or have usurped the sources of their power and turned them into personal assets. We have a democratic system that progressively benefits only a handful of leaders and politicians, and leaves millions of our people to wonder how it could be the best option available to terrorized, poor people. We have decaying value systems that breed evils such as corrupt leaders, armed criminals, drug pandemics, and encourage cheating and corruption.\n\n\u201cThe North faces two distinct choices: atrophy and destruction, or recovery and growth. The first is already visible and in process; the second a difficult, yet achievable goal. The most vital requirement that will make the difference between the two is a critical and honest self-evaluation. The North has to understand how a cultured, hardworking and intelligent people cannot produce good leaders who can build a strong economy from its huge potential.\n\n\u201cHow did corruption assume such magnitude among our communities that even the democratic system and our home-grown social and political structures and strong social values are now securely its hostage, consigning every segment of social life to insignificance unless it is linked to plundered wealth and stolen power? Why is its massive population a liability and not an asset, coming to life only during elections when it is needed to reinforce a shrinking democratic system, and relapsing into drudgery and scrapping an existence thereafter?\n\n\u201cWho and what was responsible for the virtual de-industrialization of the entire Northern region, creating patches of possibly the poorest of humanity within it, and destroying an economy that had shown an impressive potential to grow into the economic powerhouse of the nation and West Africa\u2019s breadbasket?\u201d Hakeem said.",

          "title": "Mali Junta Rallies Citizens Against ECOWAS Sanctions",
          "text": "Thousands of Malians on Friday joined staged protest rallies in several cities called by the embattled military-dominated Interim government against ECOWAS sanctions on Mali.\n\nThe regional bloc on January 9 imposed tough sanctions including financial, trade and border blockage of Mali after the Col Assimi Goita-led government announced a five-year delay to its transition programme.\n\nThis followed two military coups within a year, one of which toppled the elected government of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in August 2020.\n\nMali has already been suspended from ECOWAS, which also announced the withdrawal of member States\u2019 envoys from the country.\n\nIn its response, the Bamako regime rejected the sanctions as extreme, announced the closure of Mali borders and the withdrawal of Malian Ambassadors from ECOWAS member States.\n\nFriday\u2019s protests in Bamako, Bougouni, Timbuktu and other major cities began with prayers for peace in Mali, which is reeling under the devastation of insecurity, poverty and bad governance compounded by the Covid-19 devastation.\n\nSome of the protester had placards with Goita\u2019s picture and criticised France, the former colonial power, which is reducing its forces fighting terrorism and jihadist extremism in the Sahel region and Mali.\n\nParis and its Western allies support the ECOWAS sanctions, but are also opposed to the presence of Russian private military personnel in Mali under a defence pact between the Bamako regime and Moscow.\n\nThe Goita-led government says the Malian armed forces are recording successes in the terrorism fight with some 500 Russian military personnel on ground.\n\nThis contrasts with the presence of French forces and some 15,000-strong UN Mission, MINUSMA, which have been in Mali since 2013, costing around two billion US dollars a year to maintain.\n\nThe Mali crisis has divided the UN Security Council members with France and other EU countries supporting the ECOWAS sanctions, while Russia and China have blocked a pro-sanctions Resolution.\n\nMali shares borders with seven countries, including five ECOWAS member States \u2013 Niger, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Guinea, which is also suspended by ECOWAS because of military takeover of government in Conakry in September last year.\n\nThe Col Mamady Doumbouya-led military regime in Guinea, which has yet to unveil a Transition Commission or timetable despite an ECOWAS imposed six-month timeline, has dissociated the country from the ECOWAS sanctions against Mali.\n\nMali\u2019s two non-ECOWAS member-State neighbours \u2013 Mauritania and Algeria \u2013 have neither supported nor opposed the ECOWAS blockage of Mali.\n\nIn its official reaction, Algeria called for peaceful negotiations and proposed a \u201creasonable\u201d transition timetable of about 12 months.\n\nAlgeria has a vested interest in keeping terrorists and jihadist insurrectionists outside its borders.\n\nSubsequently, it has hosted several peace meetings on Mali, in the past, culminating in the 2015 Peace Accord signed in Algiers by Malian protagonists. But that Agreement remains largely uninplemented.\n\nIndependent observers consider the ECOWAS sanctions against Mali as disproportionately unprecedented and capable of stifling the nation and exacerbating the suffering of ordinary people.\n\nThe measures could also cause humanitarian disaster and mass displacements in the land-locked country with some 19 million people and further destabilise the restive region.\n\nNo doubt, the sanctions might hurt the junta, but they can also engender anti-ECOWAS and xenophobic sentiments, which could adversely affect regional/International interventions.\n\nTherefore, ECOWAS must act with greater independence, introspection and without foreign influences and, especially in the interest of Malians and some 400 million Community citizens in a manner consistent with its regional integration mandate.\n\nBeyond local patriotic sentiments, some political parties in Mali are opposed to military long stay in power, although they also \u201cregret\u201d the ECOWAS sanctions.\n\nGoing forward, the Bamako regime must do itself a World of good by quickening the transition process with inputs and support of local and external stakeholders all acting in good faith for the restoration of peace and constitutional order in Mali and across the region.\n\nECOWAS leaders too, must address the problems of bad governance, corruption, cronyism, election rigging and tenure elongation, which are the triggers and drivers of political instability and recession of democracy in the region.\n\nBy Paul Ejime",

          "text": "Novak Djokovic has been detained in Australia ahead of a court hearing that will determine whether the unvaccinated tennis star can stay in the country.\n\nThe Serbian faces deportation after his visa was cancelled for a second time, with the government labelling the 34-year-old a threat to public health.\n\nHis lawyers are appealing against what they called an \u201cirrational\u201d judgement, with the hearing set for Sunday.\n\nDjokovic is still scheduled to play the Australian Open on Monday in Melbourne.\n\nIf he were to win the tournament, he would become the most successful men\u2019s tennis player in the history of the sport with 21 major titles.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s hearing, which has been scheduled for 09:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Saturday), is crucial if Djokovic is to be able to compete just hours later.\n\nIf he loses the appeal, the world\u2019s top-ranked men\u2019s tennis player faces deportation and a three-year visa ban.\n\nOn Saturday, shortly after an online pre-trial hearing, Djokovic returned to the immigration detention hotel where he was held earlier this week. He will remain there until his final appeal on Sunday.\n\nAt the procedural hearing, Justice David O\u2019Callaghan set the time for Sunday\u2019s proceedings but said it was yet to be decided whether it would be heard by a single judge or a full court.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne on 6 January, after Australian Border Force officials said he had \u201cfailed to provide appropriate evidence\u201d to receive a vaccine exemption.\n\nThe tennis star was detained for days at an immigration hotel, before his visa was reinstated by a judge, who ordered his release, ruling that border officials ignored correct procedure when he arrived.\n\nBut on Friday evening, Mr Hawke once again cancelled Djokovic\u2019s visa under separate powers in Australia\u2019s Migration Act.\n\nThe act allows him to deport anyone he deems a potential risk to \u201cthe health, safety or good order of the Australian community\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision followed \u201ccareful consideration\u201d.\n\nAlluding to the heavy criticism his government has faced for allowing the unvaccinated player into Australia, Mr Morrison said: \u201cAustralians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\u201d\n\nBigger than sport\n\nMinutes after we started reporting the news of Djokovic\u2019s second visa cancellation, motorists leaned from car windows, honking their horns and shouting their approval.\n\nMost people I\u2019ve spoken to are pretty outraged that an unvaccinated player was ever allowed here in the first place.\n\nOthers have a more nuanced view. Sure, this is a shambles, they say, but the government overturning the ruling of an independent judge is pretty questionable too.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, then, that this is not just about sport. It\u2019s headline news and a major topic of conversation.\n\nAnd the background is important, too, as Australia struggles with Covid-19.\n\nMany people are getting jabbed after months of living under strict restrictions. Intensive care wards are filling up, daily deaths have hit record levels, and some might say you\u2019ve got less chance of finding a Covid test kit in a pharmacy than Djokovic has of playing on Monday.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the Omicron wave, there\u2019s another sentiment that you hear often: this drawn-out saga has become a distraction from far more important issues.\n\nline\n\nCourt documents were released later on Saturday that showed Immigration Minister Alex Hawke chose to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa because \u2013 in his view \u2013 the unvaccinated player\u2019s presence could fuel opposition to Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201c[I] consider that his presence may be a risk to the health of the Australian community,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Djokovic and his lawyers, adding that he believed it could also provoke \u201ccivil unrest\u201d because he is \u201ca person of influence and status\u201d.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s legal team say their grounds for appeal will centre on the \u201cinvalid and illogical\u201d rationale of Mr Hawke\u2019s decision, which lawyer Nick Wood said was based on the threat of \u201cexciting anti-vax sentiment\u201d.\n\nMr Wood said he believed deporting the Serbian player would potentially do the same thing.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic, meanwhile, condemned the Australian minister\u2019s decision, telling Djokovic in an Instagram message: \u201cNovak, we stand by you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to ban Novak Djokovic from winning the 10th trophy in Melbourne why didn\u2019t you return him immediately, why didn\u2019t you tell him \u2018it is impossible to obtain a visa\u2019?\u201d Mr Vucic added.\n\nSpanish tennis star Rafael, one of Djokovic\u2019s biggest rivals, said on Saturday: \u201c[The] Australian Open is much more important than any player. If he\u2019s playing finally, okay. If he\u2019s not playing, the Australian Open will be great\u2026 with or without him.\u201d\n\nJapanese player Naomi Osaka described the controversy surrounding Djokovic as \u201can unfortunate situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a great player and it\u2019s kind of sad that some people might remember [him] in this way. But I also think it\u2019s\u2026 up to the government how Australia is deciding to handle it,\u201d she said.",

The police did not record a single casualty or loss of firearms.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I am using this medium to call the attention of the general public to disregard any misleading information that may likely cause panic and disturb the peace of innocent citizens who are roaming endlessly in search of greener pasture, and to assure them of our commitment, focus and determination towards bringing an end to the insurgency and other crimes and criminality in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe training school is located 25 kilometres from Gwoza town. It is a border town between Borno and Madagali LGA of Adamawa State.\n\nISWAP Releases Video of its Men Ransacking Army Institute\n\nMeanwhile, ISWAP yesterday released a video of its fighters attacking Tukur Yusufu Buratai Institute for War and Peace (TBI), in Biu Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nThe army institute is located in the hometown of the immediate past Chief of Army Staff and current Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, Tukur Buratai.\n\nIn the video, the insurgents were seen firing in different directions, with no resistance from troops. They pulled down flags on the campus and torched some military vehicles.\n\nA security source said: \u201cMost residents have fled to Moringa, another town in Biu. The ISWAP came in large numbers shooting RPGs and anti-aircraft guns.\u201d\n\nReacting to the attack, the management of Army University in Biu confirmed that two civilians lost their lives but that normalcy had since returned.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe terrorists who came in their numbers were met by superior firepower forcing them to retreat in disarray. Unfortunately, two civilian staff of the Institute paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cManagement wishes to commend troops for their gallantry during the attack and to commiserate with families of the fallen staff.\n\n\u201cFinally, management wishes to assure the general public that the Institute remains 100% operational as security has been beefed up in the general area.\u201d\n\nChibok LGA Attacked\n\nFour persons have been found dead, while a search for missing persons is ongoing, following an attack by ISWAP in Kautikari community, Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State yesterday.\n\nAccording to residents, the insurgents invaded the area around 5pm with different of weapons and started shooting sporadically.\n\nThe terrorists thereafter set houses ablaze, and residents had to run to the bushes for safety.\n\n\u201cThey first went to the market area as today is our market day, and they looted almost everything. After that, they set the market on fire. And then they started burning the houses. They also burnt this big church in the village, one of the villagers said.\u201d\n\nAnother source said when the insurgents arrived, the army\u2019s 28 task force brigade headquarters was contacted but there was no immediate response \u201cand the attack lasted more than two hours\u201d.\n\nAlthough the village is about 17 kilometres away from the army brigade headquarters in Chibok, there is an army company under the 117 battalion stationed in Kwada, not too far from the scene of the attack.\n\nA company is a military formation usually made up of at least 80 soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe know it could take time for troops to mobilise from the brigade, but we were shocked that the company that was just one kilometre away didn\u2019t move an inch to help,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe villagers said they had also reached the air force, and a fighter jet came to the area after the insurgents had left.\n\nMeanwhile, troops are on the ground conducting a search-and-rescue operation.\n\n\u201cFour dead bodies have been found, and an unknown number of women and girls have been abducted. The insurgents also took a number of tricycles belonging to the villagers,\u201d another resident added.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri",
