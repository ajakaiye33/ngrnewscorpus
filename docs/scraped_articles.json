          "title": "Suspected kidnappers implicated me for fighting violent crimes \u2013 ABU former CSO",
          "text": "A former chief security officer of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Mr Sheu Bello, has accused some suspects arrested in connection with kidnappings in the institution of implicating him.\n\nHe said the suspects indicted him because he always assisted the police in tracking down bandits.\n\nOur correspondent had reported that three suspects \u2013 Abubakar Aliyu, Abubakar Yakubu, aka Dogo, and Isaa Kabiru aka Wicked \u2013 were arrested by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response team for allegedly kidnapping two lecturers and four others in the institution.\n\nAliyu and Yakubu indicted Bello as the mastermind but Kabiru said he was not involved in the crime, adding that he used to buy stolen cows from the gang.\n\nHowever, Bello, well known as Danlamin, debunked his involvement in the kidnappings in an interview with our correspondent during the week.\n\nThe 49-year-old former CSO also denied being sacked from the office, noting that he was \u201cceremoniously relieved of the post\u201d and became the officer in charge of the National Security Institute of Animal Production Research under the university.\n\nHe said, \u201cI hold a master\u2019s degree in Disaster Risk Management. I started working at the university in 1993 as a technical assistant at the Agric Department and rose to the rank of an assistant technical officer. I then moved to the university\u2019s security division on the main campus on the request of the then Chief Security Officer and the then Vice- Chancellor, because I used to assist in the security operations of the university.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I was the officer in-charge of the auxiliary security staff and became the OC (officer-in-charge) X-Squad in 2007. I was asked by the university management to design an office that can handle cultism and violent crimes and I became the pioneer head of that unit. That was the post I held until I became the acting Chief Security Officer of the university in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen I was the CSO, I worked with security agencies, including the IRT and Special Tactical Squad. There were few kidnapping incidents around the university before I became the CSO. I worked with the police in combating these incidents and suspects were arrested. Some of the victims in those cases were staff members who lived outside the university, but there was one involving the daughter of the former VC of the university, Professor Abdullahi Mustapha.\n\n\u201cThere has never been any dispute per se between the present VC and me, but there is always politics on the campus. There are people who wanted to become the CSO and they were peddling different kinds of stories since I was appointed the acting CSO by the former vice- chancellor.\u201d\n\nBello explained that his men together with the police arrested about 11 suspects who were consequently charged, adding that those eyeing the CSO office exploited his loyalty to the former VC to spread negative stories about him.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised when they mentioned my name and that of Adol Bello as their sponsors because we have been a thorn in their flesh for a long time. I cannot get myself involved in such a crime with all I have achieved in life. I can\u2019t do such outside the university, let alone in the university where I was born and where my parents also served. The university is my home; I can only protect it and not harm it. The people who mentioned our names know our importance in the university and they know we will stop at nothing in dealing with violent crimes within the university.\u201d\n\nThe Acting Director, Public Affairs of the university, Auwalu Umar, said he did not have the full detail of the kidnappings but Bello had no issue with the institution.\n\nHe said, \u201cI need to do further investigation but he was not sacked. He was acting CSO and was redeployed. He is still in the employ of the university and we don\u2019t have any issue with him.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Saturday, said the ongoing Agro-Allied Cargo Airport located at Ilishan-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area, would be ready for inauguration by the end of 2022.\n\nThe governor said this while speaking at Ikenne as part of the ongoing campaign of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the July 24 LG poll.\n\nHe said he remained committed to the project, despite stiff resistance in some quarters.\n\nAbiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, had locked horns over the nature and location of the airport project in the state.\n\nThe governor made a case for an Agro-Allied Cargo airport located at Ilishan-Remo, Ikenne LGA, while Amosun strongly backed a passenger airport located at Wasimi, Ewekoro LGA of the state.\n\nAddressing party stalwarts and residents of Ikenne LGA, Abiodun said he would not bow to opposition.\n\nAccording to him, as governor, the buck stops at his table.\n\nThe governor later led his campaign train to the site of the airport project, with the promise that it would be ready for use next year.\n\nAbiodun said, \u201cAeroplanes will be landing here in Ikenne. Some people are building airports, some \u2018airstrips\u2019 and some domestic airports. They are embittered, they are fighting us. They said we can\u2019t site the airport here, and I said, \u2018It is a lie.\u2019\n\n\u201cI am the governor of Ogun State as we speak. I am in possession of both the bread and the knife. And I will share it as it pleases me. We have sited the project here already and by the end of next year, we will commission that airport.\u201d\n\nAbiodun said Ikenne LGA was \u201cspecially blessed,\u201d considering the number of prominent personalities who hailed from the council, including himself; the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo; and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, among others.\n\nHe said his administration had either constructed or reconstructed over 270km of roads and rehabilitated about 100 primary healthcare centres across the state.\n\nSpeaking earlier at Odogbolu, Abiodun declared that his administration would soon set up a Special Task Force to tackle cultism in the state.\n\nHe said his administration would not allow cultists and other criminal elements to undermine the development of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, Abiodun has disclosed that the Federal Government has approved the contract for the reconstruction of Ilaro-Papalanto-Sagamu Expressway in the state.\n\nWhile noting that the road crosses through Obafemi-Owode, Ewekoro, Yewa South and North local government areas, Abiodun said it was a major arterial road linking Ogun State to other states and the ECOWAS sub-region.\n\nThe governor said this while addressing the residents and people of Yewa South at Ilaro, during a campaign tour of Ogun West ahead of the local government election..\n\nHe disclosed that the reconstruction of the 100-kilometre road would cost the government about N79bn.\n\nThe governor, who said his administration had already completed 66 projects in the Yewa South LG, gave assurance that the Owode-Ilaro Road would be completed before the end of the year.\n\nSpeaking earlier in Ipokia, the governor said his administration would soon take a decision on the viability and sustainability of the establishment of the Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia established by his predecessor.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Why logistics will power AfCFTA and Africa\u2019s e-Commerce export potential",
          "text": ".\n\nIzin Akioya\n\nAfrica is the second-largest continent in the world, with an estimated 1.3 billion people. Its combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $2.6 trillion in 2020, and the African Development Bank (AfDB) projects a 3.4% growth rate by year-end 2021.\n\nThis modest forecast might be ambitious considering the staggering effects of Covid-19 on commercial activities. It left international borders closed for much of last year, led to a significant devaluation of currencies, an estimated output loss of $115 billion, according to World Bank findings, and continues to restrict regional and international travel.\n\nThis dire circumstance may have catalysed an increase in consumer e-Commerce spending across the continent amid mixed year-end results. For e-Commerce giant, Jumia, headquartered in Nigeria with a presence in about 11 countries within the region, COVID-19 had an overall net negative effect on business in 2020.\n\nAccording to the brand\u2019s 2020 financial report, \u201cAs a result of only limited recourse to nationwide lockdowns across its footprint, the pandemic did not lead to a drastic change in consumer behaviour nor meaningful acceleration in consumer adoption of e-Commerce at a Pan-African level\u201d. Conversely, despite one-off investments based on the pandemic and strict lockdown regulations, Takealot, South Africa\u2019s biggest e-tailer, recorded major growth in the six-month period ended 30 September 2020. According to Naspers\u2019 consolidated financial statements, its R6.26 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) signalled 85% growth year-on-year, while first-party and third-party businesses grew by 69% and 119% respectively.\n\nDespite the conflicting outcomes of Covid-19, Africa\u2019s e-Commerce remains on a high innovation, high-growth trajectory, owing to the convergence of key indicators: the continent\u2019s demographics, internet and mobile penetration potentials, digital transformation and ecosystem maturity. Africa\u2019s rapidly advancing e-commerce landscape boasts home-grown mobile-first solutions. Mobile money continues to reinforce value and efficiency for the continent\u2019s growing digital consumers with \u201cpay on arrival\u201d options being adopted broadly.\n\nSimilar to global counterparts, the logistics components of the e-commerce funnel have continued to disrupt and innovate, both in response to the pandemic and in the bid to charter access to new markets driven by evolving consumer trends and purchasing behaviour.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s e-Commerce retail stands at just 1% of its total retail performance, its potential to harness the benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are huge, especially in the light of its rapid digital transformation hitherto highlighted. The agreement, driven by a 54-member economic bloc looking to cut tariffs on 90% of goods and liberalise trade across Africa, might very well be the catalyst for new trans-border growth possibilities within the region. Arguments in favour of AfCFA are compelling.\n\nAs of 2017, the percentage of intra-African exports to total African exports was a paltry 17%, compared to levels in Europe (69%), Asia (59%) and North America (31%). This implies Africa needs to urgently align with the AfCFTA mandate and trade with itself to facilitate the exchange of manufactured goods, knowledge transfer and holistic economic diversification. The continent has what it takes to become a regional commerce hub. Data from Euromonitor International pegs the value of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s apparel and footwear market alone at US 31 billion.\n\nFrom a supply chain perspective, the removal and consolidation of tariffs have immense benefits for the region\u2019s manufacturing players; in beauty, fashion, household and gallantry, sectors that are still largely import-dependent. Eliminating the bottlenecks will no less improve competitiveness, enabling the region to serve its own need for finished goods, while improving its viability as a global sourcing destination.\n\nAfrica\u2019s opportunity for \u201cnew\u201d export growth will hinge on its competitiveness as a sourcing destination for both value-added products and direct to consumer goods. Beyond considerations for \u201ccost of goods\u201d, buyers globally will be looking for right-priced, timely and effective logistics solutions with minimal disruptions.\n\nIndigenous small and medium businesses, while benefitting from a broadened retail landscape, will be seeking flexible logistics solutions that create inroads for global warehousing, quick turnaround on deliveries and reduced lag time on order fulfilment. These are non-negotiables should they stand a chance at making a real play in the highly competitive global retail scene. Ethiopia is blessed with a $145 million/year apparel sourcing industry and is all set to grow its exports to $30 billion annually by 2030. Textiles also account for 15% of the Moroccan economy\u2019s GDP, but its main export partner is Europe, not Africa. Rwanda\u2019s promise is tech-based.\n\nIn 2019, its Mara Group launched two indigenous smartphones \u2013 the Mara X and Mara Z \u2013 the first set fully manufactured in Africa. Small wonder the Brookings Institution\u2019s Report projects that if AfCFTA is fully implemented, it will boost manufacturing and jack up continental trade to 50% by 2040.\n\nThe AfCFTA couldn\u2019t be timelier. Its expected impact on the region\u2019s manufacturing and intra-trade potentials converge with its rapid digital transformation, providing a real opportunity for African e-Commerce and indigenous brands to compete at the inflexion point of global logistics and supply chains, evidenced by re-onshoring and offshoring strategies being adopted globally, as China\u2019s competitive dynamics as a sourcing destination evolves. Globally, digital transformation is aiding new business models to capture emerging sales channels.\n\nOmni-channels are being adopted broadly to ensure modern shoppers are able to complete purchases and returns combining both online and offline alternatives. The convergence of wholesale and retail is being led by the increase in manufacturer-to-consumer models. According to Logistyx 2021 manufacturing trend report, omnichannel strategies require a range of dynamic logistics alternatives; localised warehousing, next day delivery and smaller parcel sizes. Delivery locations are also on the rise, driving increased demand for flexibility and alternative shipping approaches.\n\nEvidence of the continent\u2019s digital logistics innovations can be seen broadly across the key e-Commerce markets. DHL Africa\u2019s e-Shop, a 2019 market introduction, is live in over 34 African countries. The shipping giant is also building partnerships across the continent\u2019s small and medium business landscape, leveraging small communities. Similarly, indigenous digital order fulfilment companies have begun hybridizing storage and logistics services.\n\nKenya-based Africa Logistics Properties claims it has developed over 1.5 million square metres of warehousing available for rent in emerging markets over the past 10 years.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s ACT Logistics offers multi-modal freight services, pick-and-pack warehousing and export services aggregating transportation, clearing and warehousing as its suite of services. Jumia introduced its third-party logistics services in 2020, while Kenya-based start-up Sote launched software that aims to aggregate customs clearing and forwarding processes on one platform, with a vision to help cargo owners track shipments, payment status and estimated arrivals of their consignments. These innovations will democratise access to flexible and effective logistics solutions, building the critical ecosystem required for Africa\u2019s advancement in intra-regional and global export.\n\nThe AfCFTA mandate requires more than just having 54 countries put pen to paper. A combination of private and public sector efforts is needed to accrue the potential benefits. Policy action and adoption must be quick, governments must remain open to collaborating with innovation drivers to eliminate process and bureaucratic constraints.\n\nBlockchain technology is available to help with decentralised ledger systems and smart contracts for quicker clearance processes at checkpoints. Automated warehousing can fast-track the processing of high-volume goods at scale and optimize floor space utilisation. Artificial intelligence can help with demand forecasting to reduce bad inventory, assess risk and automate administrative processes in logistics.\n\nIn July 2019, Nigeria joined other African nations to sign the AfCFTA agreement. This is commendable, considering the country\u2019s influence on the rest of the continent. Africa stands to benefit from the convergence of factors driving its digital adoption and e-commerce, but actualising this feat requires all hands on deck to optimise critical success factors, including manufacturing capabilities and its logistical framework. On this, our collective will shall always find a way.\n\nIzin is a Lagos-based fashion and logistics entrepreneur",

          "text": "\u2026As Nwankpo, ADC shine\n\nBy Nnamdi Ojiego\n\nFOUR months to the November 6, 2021, governorship election in Anambra State, old front runners have given way to new champions.\n\nFollowing high level legal battles within the state chapters of the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the African Democratic Congress (ADC) has emerged as frontrunner in the election.\n\nAmong the three big parties-APGA, APC and PDP, the situation of things appear most complicated. In APC, despite attempts by the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), to reconcile aggrieved governorship aspirants, courts cases have been filed to challenge the return of Senator Andy Uba as the winner of the APC primary on June 26, 2021.\n\nAPC\n\nIt would be recalled that on the day of the governorship primary, one of the top contenders, Dr. George Moghalu, shouted out to Nigerians, stressing that materials and personnel for the intra-party election could not be seen at any of the 326 electoral wards of the state.\n\nMoghalu, who is also the Managing Director of Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), later led 11 other aspirants to address a joint press conference in Awka, the state capital and Abuja, on what he called the rape of internal democracy by the APC Governorship Primary Election Committee led by Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nHe was emphatic that \u201cin a few locations in the state, election materials arrived late in the evening, after both voters and officials had dispersed and long past the time, when it was possible to conduct even a semblance of an election.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moghalu, \u201cDespite this evident reality, the primary Election Committee appointed by the leadership of the party and chaired by the Governor of Ogun State, Prince (Dr.) Dapo Abiodun, went ahead to produce and announce purported results based on nothing other than their fertile imagination and motivated by their private interests and arrangements.\u201d\n\nMoghalu swore that he would \u201cdo everything within my abilities and the law, to ensure that the travesty orchaestrated by Gov. Abiodun and his team will not stand. There is no way the party could accept a fictitious result when it was obvious no election was held anywhere.\u201d\n\nShortly after Moghalu\u2019s declaration of legal war against the emergence of Senator Uba, the Federal High Court, Awka, received a suit filled by Comrade Maxwell Okoye, through his counsel, Mr. B. O. Okemmadu.\n\nOkoye prayed the court to grant an order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from \u201cadmitting or publishing the name of Uba\u201d as the governorship candidate of APC for the election.\n\nJustice H. A. Nganjiwa, while ruling on the motion, said the 1st and 3rd respondents, APC and INEC, \u201cshould and must maintain the status quo in the interest of Justice and must not accept, publish or cause to admit the 2nd respondent (Dr. Andy Uba), as the candidate of APC\u201d in the gubernatorial election pending the hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nPDP\n\nPDP conducted a parallel primary election which produced Senator Ugochukwu Uba and Mr. Valentine Ozigbo as winners. Although the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) has identified with Ozigbo as the party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, some disenfranchised statutory and ad hoc delegates are kicking against the process that threw up the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Transnational Corporation Plc, Ozigbo.\n\nIn a statement by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP NWC disclosed that it was getting ready to pursue a winning campaign, stressing that its flag bearer, Ozigbo, is about the most popular candidate to be on the ballot.\n\nPDP urged its members and supporters, especially people of Anambra State to disregard any persons claiming to be the party\u2019s flag-bearer, saying they are propelled by forces of disunity. It recalled that as the party\u2019s authentic candidate, Ozigbo received his certificate of return from PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, on June 30, 2021, after his victory was certified by the party\u2019s NWC.\n\nThe PDP national leadership described the former Transcorp Plc boss as an accomplished professional that \u201cpossesses all the leadership qualities desired by Ndi Anambra in their collective quest to rescue their state from misrule and reposition her for greater productivity.\u201d\n\nBut despite the clarification by PDP NWC, the Uba brothers and other party faithful insist that the election of Ozigbo did not conform with the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution. They added that Ozigbo\u2019s emergence was also riddled with fraud.\n\nFirst runner-up in the primary held at the Dora Akunyili Women\u2019s Development Centre, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, alleged that the organisers of the primary continued to manipulate the delegate list by adding and replacing names at will. Okonkwo, who is also the Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines, regretted that even after juggling names, the collation of the votes failed to explain the whereabouts of 17 votes, insisting that delegates and votes cast for him were cleverly left out to produce a thin margin of four votes between his 58 votes and Ozigbo\u2019s 62.\n\nApart from Okonkwo, the disenfranchised statutory and adhoc delegates are said to be spoiling for legal war as they claim that the governorship primary was conducted in breach of Article 25 (1) of the PDP constitution.\n\nThe litigants maintain that Article 25(1) listed the categories of officers to take part in a state congress, stressing that the PDP Constitution, which established the State Congress as an organ of the party also stipulated voting at the party\u2019s primary election as the basic constitutional mandate.\n\nThe disenfranchised delegates are citing the Supreme Court judgement delivered by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour in the matter of Uzodinma vs. Izunaso in 2011, as the basis of their assurance that the party may not field a candidate for the November 6 governorship poll.\n\nIn that landmark judgment, the then Supreme Court Justice declared: \u201cThe court will never allow a political party to act arbitrarily or as it likes. Political parties must obey their own constitution, and once this is done, there would be orderliness, and this would be good for politics and the country.\u201d\n\nSelf-acclaimed political godfather of Anambra State and member of PDP Board of Trustees, Chief Chris Uba, has sworn to fight the case to the highest court in the land, even as he insists that his elder brother, Ugochukwu, is the authentic governorship candidate of the party.\n\nWhat this means is that PDP would be explaining in court why it had to use super delegates instead of statutory and adhoc delegates, two-thirds majority of which would have elected the party\u2019s governorship flag bearer for the election.\n\nAPGA\n\nIn APGA, although the party chose the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, as its flagbearer, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) picked holes in the process that threw him up. INEC, through its Commissioner for Voter Education and Mobilisation, Festus Okoye, said that like the Zamfara State APC example, it did not meet the 21-days mandatory notification of the commission before it conducted the primary.\n\nAdd to that, a splinter group headed by Jude Okoye, sacked the national chairman, Victor Oye, for failing to fulfil the INEC regulation and thereby endangering the party\u2019s participation in the governorship election. The Okoye faction later organised another primary in which a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, emerged as winner.\n\nAs if that is not enough, the Chief Edozie Njoku faction that had been in court against Oye, obtained a Court order that recognised its right to conduct a governorship primary and elected Njoku as its flagbearer. He told reporters that it is his faction that would enable APGA feature in the election, when the court finally delivers judgment in his case against Oye\u2019s emergence as national chairman.\n\nADC\n\nAs things stand in Anambra State today, if the election holds tomorrow, Nze Akachukwu Sullivan Nwankpo stands out as the most likely candidate to succeed the outgoing governor, Chief Willie Obiano in office. The emergence of Nwankpo, former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s Special Assistant on Technical Matters, as the ADC governorship candidate, sounds as a rehash of the rejected stone that became the pillar.\n\nNwankpo, who recently accepted the party\u2019s nomination of Mr. Law Ughamadu, a pastor, as his running mate, moved swiftly from being a victim of APGA\u2019s internal bickering to a beneficiary of the crises in the three mega parties-APGA, APC and PDP.\n\nThe former Presidential aide had various times belonged to PDP and APGA. Ever since he emerged as ADC governorship candidate, the party has come alive in Anambra State as the possible alternative to APGA.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, was also a founding member of APGA. He left when leaders of the party imposed Mr. Peter Obi as the party\u2019s governorship candidate in 2003. Now, with the trouble in APGA, a lot of disaffected members who are kicking against the tradition of imposition have decided to identify with ADC en masse.\n\nNze Akachukwu Nwankpo commended Nwosu for being steadfast, saying that his insistence that things should be done the proper way has paved way for Anambra people to have a governor of their making. In line with Nwankpo\u2019s campaign promise, billboards bearing such messages as \u2018Anambra Families First\u2019, \u2018Give the Voice Back to the People\u2019 are springing up at strategic junctions by volunteer sponsors.\n\nIn his acceptance speech shortly after his nomination, the ADC candidate said he was manipulated out of APGA after Governor Obiano had publicly praised him for being a good man.\n\nNwankpo stated: \u201cWhen I started this journey there are people who never believed my name will appear on the ballot paper. \u201cSome didn\u2019t believe it because they felt I have no money, some didn\u2019t believe it because they felt I have no connection, and some didn\u2019t believe it because they believe they can steal it. Those who stole it in the first party I went to, will see they have stolen nothing.\u201d\n\nHe assured that after being sworn in as governor, he would restore family values and protect the life and property of every person in the state by encouraging good neighbourliness and harmonious inter-personal relationships.\n\nWill protest votes and Nwankpo/Ughamadu\u2019s goodwill help ADC supplant APGA and win the Anambra State governorship seat come November 6? The journey is just beginning.",

          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nAtyap Community Development Association (ACDA) on Saturday said 42 persons were killed, 7 wounded and 338 houses set ablaze in the latest attacks in several communities in Zangon Kataf local government area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe association which rolled out the statistics when its leadership addressed journalists at the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kaduna Council, added that 8 cars, 13 motorcycles, generators, food and domestic items were either looted or razed within what they described as \u201conslaught\u201d against Atyap Chiefdom.\n\nPresident of the association, Samuel T. Achie, who read the press statement, therefore, called on the government of Kaduna state to without fear or favour come alive to its responsibility to put an end to the \u201cdastard\u201d and \u201ccondemnable killings\u201d of its citizens, by way of fishing out and brought the perpetrators to justice.\n\nAccording to him, until the latest attacks, the Fulani and Atyap communities had earlier signed a peace pact which has been so far respected by all and sundry, hence, finding it difficult to unravel the provocations that have sent scores to their early grave and property worth millions destroyed.\n\nSamuel said, \u201cin all the attacks in the 12 different villages as of July 15, 2021, a total of 42 people were killed and 338 houses burnt with 7 people wounded. Several other valuables were not left out as 8 Cars, 13 motorcycles, generators, food and domestic items were either looted or consumed by fire\n\n\u201cOur revered places of worship were not spared as 7 churches and their pastorium razed down by fire in various locations.\n\n\u201cAmong the houses razed down by the activities If these Fulani Militia are the family compound of our paramount Ruler, His Royal Highness Sir Dominic Yahaya in Magamiya and also the Family Compound of Retired Major General Shekari Biliyock in Abuyab a former commandant of the Nigeria-African Peace Keeping Arm, the ECOMOG.\n\n\u201cThe entire Atyap Nation seems to be at loss to these senseless killings by the Fulani Militia, as we have bend over to implement the decisions of the peace accord reached with the parties involved.\n\n\u201cThe question is what else were we supposed to do that was not done? It seems apparent that these attacks are being sponsored with larger motives than meet the eyes\u201d he queried.\n\nHe continued, \u201cwith all these being said, in concrete terms we can submit that the resolution of our desire for peace is under threat by this Fulani Militia. We felt that we will be better off if we stay in peace as brothers as was the case in time past.\n\n\u201cIt is a well-known fact world over that all crises are not won at the battlefield, but at the round table through discussions that could lead to amicable resolution of the crisis with the parties determined to bring an end to it.\n\n\u201cThe Commander in Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria once said that anybody found in possession of deadly arm be shot at sight. But as I am talking to you, Fulani Militias still graze in Atyap land with AK47 hung on their shoulders and shot at any sight of a Kataf man.\n\n\u201cThere is no any place in all the areas attacked that has a distance of more than 10 to 15 minutes drive from one security checkpoint to the other. It is not only lives and houses that were destroyed, but crops and places of worship inclusive.\n\n\u201cOur people are known to be purely peasant farmers, but at this season of farming have to abandon their farms for fear of being killed. All schools in the area are closed down hence our children can no longer go to school, therefore, creating a humanitarian crisis for all the displaced people in the land, which in turn create an urgent need for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp to cater for those that have been left at the mercy of the weather both in rain and sunshine without any roof on their heads since the renewed persistent attacks.\n\n\u201cThese whole things look like the Fulani Militia wants to grab and occupy our land. The Atyap people are law-abiding citizens that have been loyal to all successive governments to date and wonder why we should be left alone to carry our cross now.\n\n\u201cBased on these, we ask that government provide more troops, humanitarian relief materials and a peaceful atmosphere for all, else we will be left with no other option than to protect ourselves using all legal means\u201d, he added.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Are you a landlord or tenant in Lagos? These are things you should know",
          "text": "By Romanus Okoye\n\nTo live peacefully in Lagos, it is vital that tenants and landlords understand the law regulating their rights and obligations. For such purpose, the tenancy laws of Lagos State were enacted on August 5, 2011 at the Lagos State House of Assembly and signed by the then governor, Babatunde Fashola on August 24, same year. It is now the main law regulating housing in Lagos State. Lawyers speak on its provisions.\n\nSaid PGC Achigasim, a lawyer: \u201cThe tenancy law of Lagos is unique. It is found in its attempt to remove the perceived bottlenecks in the old law. One of such provisions is the removal of the hitherto provision that says that \u201ca notice to quit\u201d must expire on the anniversary of the tenancy. With the landlords and tenants law, the notice to quit could be given at any time and expire at any time. Even after the anniversary of tenancy provided, it complies with the law.\n\n\u201cAnother uniqueness of the law is the provision of the law on monthly and quarterly tenancy. Once a tenant is in arrears of rent for a month in the case of a monthly tenancy or three months in the case of a quarterly tenancy, then the need for notice to quit is dispensed with. In other words, one does not need to issue and serve such tenants in arrears, notice to quit.\n\n\u201cThe law criminalizes non-issuance of receipt of payment after receiving payment by the landlord. The penalty or fine is N250, 000.00. There is also the provision for an order to open a property, which was locked up by a tenant. This provision takes care of a situation where a tenant locks up the property of the landlord and relocates to another place before the landlord would need to go through the route of proving his case before the property can be opened. But this law allows such landlord to file a motion on notice to force open the said property.\n\n\u201cIt is largely credited with the new ways landlord\u2019s request for rents now. Before now, landlords required two years\u2019 rent from tenants but landlords now collect one year\u2019s rent. To this extent, the law has succeeded. The only drawback is that it is discriminatory. Its provisions are inapplicable in the highbrow areas of the state like the Ikeja G.R.A, Apapa GRA, Ikoyi, Victoria Island etc.\u201d\n\nJide Ogundimu, a lawyer and housing specialist, also stated: \u201cSection 1 of the law which deals with its application, stipulates as follows; (1) This law shall apply to all premises within Lagos State, including business and residential premises unless otherwise specified. The following areas: (i) Apapa; (ii) Ikeja GRA (iii) Ikoyi; and (iv) Victoria Island are exempted from the application of this law. The Governor may, however, from time to time, by order published in the State Official Gazette, exempt the application of this law to any other area or premises in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Rent Control and Recovery of Residential Premises Law Vol. 7 Laws of Lagos State 2003 and the newly enacted Tenancy Laws of Lagos State 2011 are the current laws regulating tenancies in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Act covers advance rent, and it provides as follows: It is unlawful for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive from a sitting tenant rent in excess of six months for a monthly tenant and one year for a yearly tenant in respect of any premises without prejudice to the nature of tenancy held at the commencement.\n\n\u201cIt is unlawful for a sitting tenant to offer or pay rent in excess of one year for a yearly tenant and six months for a monthly tenant in respect of any. It is unlawful for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive from a would-be tenant rent in excess of one year in respect of any. It is unlawful for a new or would-be tenant to offer or pay rent in excess of one year in respect of any. Any person who receives or pays rent in excess of what is prescribed in this section will be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine of N100, 000.00 or to three months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cSection 1(2) provides as follows: \u201cThis law will not apply to: residential premises owned or operated by an educational institution for its staff and students; residential premises provided for emergency shelter; residential premises in a care or hospice facility, in a public or private hospital or a mental health facility, and that is made available in the course of providing rehabilitative or therapeutic treatment.\u201d\n\nFunmi Adeogun, MCIArb ( UK), Vice Chairman, NBA Epe Branch and treasurer, NBA SPIDEL added: \u201cTenants in Lagos have to know that once a quit notice is served on them, it doesn\u2019t mean they are excused from paying rents. They must know that there must be an agreement between the landlord and tenant on rent increment as opposed to just informing the tenant. They must also know that once they sign the tenancy agreement, they would be bound by it.\u201d\n\nOther key matters\n\nUnder the Lagos State Tenancy Law of 2011, which is similar to the tenancy laws of other states in Nigeria, it is an offence to try to forcefully evict a tenant. It is also illegal for a landlord or his agent to disrupt the peaceful enjoyment of the demised property in a bid to frustrate the tenant and force him to move out.\n\nEviction of a tenant\n\nThe first step to evict a tenant in Lagos State is to issue what is referred to as the statutory notices. There are two statutory notices that should be issued and they are the \u201cNotice to Quit\u201d and the \u201cNotice of Owner\u2019s Intention to Recover Premises.\u201d\n\nThe notices are called statutory notices because there is a specific format. Statutory notices are not mere letters you write to a tenant asking him to surrender possession of your property. There is a special format which must be used and the format is contained in the tenancy law.\n\nNotice to Quit\n\nA notice to quit is the first statutory notice a property owner ought to give his tenant. The rules guiding the issuance of notice to quit provide that the notice to quit is to be issued in accordance with the tenancy agreement. What this means is that if there was a written tenancy agreement and the agreement states the length of notice to be given, then the notice to quit should comply with the tenancy agreement in order for it to be valid.\n\nHowever, where there is no tenancy agreement, or if the tenancy agreement does not state the length of the notice, then the following rules shall apply:\n\nFor a yearly tenancy, the length of notice should be a minimum of six months. For a half-yearly tenancy the length of notice should be a minimum of three months. And for a monthly tenancy, the length of notice should be a minimum of one month.\n\nNotice of Owner\u2019s Intention to Recover Premises\n\nAfter the expiration of the notice to quit, the tenant is expected to vacate the premises and surrender possession. However, in reality, some tenants remain on the property either due to the needed resources to move elsewhere or due to being adamant. At this point, you are expected to issue the seven days notice of the owner\u2019s intention to recover premises. The seven days notice, just like the notice to quit, also has a specific format, which must be strictly adhered to.\n\nThe rationale behind issuing the seven days notice is to inform the tenant that you intend to approach the court for an eviction order. If the tenant still refuses to vacate after the seven days notice, then you are expected to approach the court for an order of eviction.\n\nInstitute a recovery of premises action in court\n\nIf a tenant refuses to vacate the premises and deliver up possession, then the proper thing to do next will be to file a court action. In Lagos State, the recovery of premises action can either be filed in the magistrates\u2019 court or the high court.\n\nIf the rental value of the premises occupied by the tenant is above N10 million, then the high court would be the proper venue for the matter. If on the other hand, the rental value is below N10 million, then the magistrates\u2019 court within the division or district would be the appropriate court to approach. Once the matter has been filed in court, both parties can either opt to settle amicably or proceed to trial.\n\nSettle Amicably\n\nBoth parties can explore settlement if the tenant agrees to vacate the premises but perhaps is requesting for more time. The parties can meet along with their solicitors and agree on the terms of the settlement. Upon reaching a conclusive agreement, the solicitors would file terms of settlement document which would be adopted by the court as its judgment in the suit.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "FG to Take Possession of Repatriated Benin Artifacts",
          "text": "*Institutes claim against Belgian over attempt to auction $5m Ife head\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has in clear terms ruled out turning over the 1,130 Benin bronzes presently in possession of the German government to the any individuals or subnational groups when the artefacts are finally repatriated to the country by August 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed made this clarification on Saturday while addressing the press in Lagos on the efforts by the federal government to repatriate looted and smuggled artefacts from around the world.\n\nThe remarks came on the heels of the controversy between the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II and the Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki over who should take possession of the artefacts.\n\nWhile the monarch is backing the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, the governor has vouched for a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nWhile shedding light on the controversy, Mohammed said that the return of the artefacts was being negotiated bilaterally between the federal government of Nigeria and Germany in line with international best practice and the operative conventions and laws.\n\nThe minister, who last week led a federal delegation to Berlin to negotiate with the German authorities on the modalities for the unconditional repatriation of the artefacts that were looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897, during a raid by the colonial government, insisted that Nigeria, rather than any sub group was the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from the country.\n\nHe added that international conventions recognized cultural heritage as properties that belong to a nation but not individuals and sub-national groups.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, the Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany. Let me state clearly here that, in line with international best practice and the operative Conventions and laws, the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of Nigeria and Germany.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe relevant international Conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added that the Article 1 of the UNESCO Convention in 1970, defined cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation;\n\nHe stressed that the article allowed an individual nation to determine what it regards as its cultural property, adding the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments \u2013 has been working assiduously over the past years to repatriate the looted artefacts in collaboration with important traditional institutions and state governments.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying in essence is that the Federal government will take possession of these antiquities, because it is its duty to do so, in line with the extant laws. But we have always exercised this right in cognizance of that culture that produced the art works. That is why the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments have always involved both the Edo State government and the Royal Benin Palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe minister also revealed that the federal government had instituted a claim in Paris before the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to it Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP), against a Belgian who wanted to auction an Ife Bronze head valued at $5 million, at least.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Ife Bronze antiquity had been seized by the London Metropolitan Police, pending the decision on who the true owner is.\n\nIn addition, he said the federal government had also secured a date in October 2021 for the repatriation of antiquities from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n\nHe said the antiquities consisted of two important Benin Bronzes and an exquisite\n\nIfe Bronze head.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, even though not everyone in possession of these artefacts is willing to return them, we remain undeterred as we have deployed all legal and diplomatic means and we have been recording successes in our quest for repatriation. Here are some of the successes we have recorded since that press conference in 2019:\n\n\u2013 In October 2020, The Netherlands returned a highly-valued 600-year-old Ife Terracotta.\n\n\u2013 In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze from its collections. We shall take possession of this in October this year.\n\n\u2013 In April 2021, we received a bronze piece from Mexico.\n\n\u2013 The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has also agreed to return a disputed Benin artefact. We will soon commence the procedure for the repatriation of this highly-valued piece\u201d.\n\nThe minister assured that the federal government will ensure the repatriation of not just the Benin artefacts, as it is equally working towards repatriating Ife Bronzes and Terracotta, Nok Terracotta, Owo Terracotta, the arts of the Benue River Valley, the Igbo Ukwu, the arts of Bida, the arts of Igala, Jukun among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "House Adopts E-Transmission of Results \u2018Where Practicable\u2019, Opposition Walks Out",
          "text": "*Elumelu: Process, a sham, House leadership prevented INEC from addressing lawmakers\n\n*NCC: Nigeria lacks adequate network coverage for seamless electronic transmission of results\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday passed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, amid a walkout staged by opposition members, with the controversial Clause 52(2) intact, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201cmay transmit results of the election through electronic means where and when practicable\u201d.\n\nThe Senate passed same bill on Thursday but added that the \u201cNigerian Communications Commission (NCC) must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure, while the national assembly must approve,\u201d before INEC can adopt E-transmission of results.\n\nYesterday, when the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill was being done, the deputy speaker, Idris Wase, who presided over the sitting, skipped clause 52, and said it would be revisited after all other clauses had been considered.\n\nAfter the clauses of the bill were considered, Ndudi Elumelu, Minority Leader of the house, raised a point of order that clause 52 of the bill which stipulates the method of transmission of result be considered.\n\nBut Wase, said the clause could only be reconsidered, if a motion of rescission on it was moved.\n\nElumelu argued that there was no need for rescission, since the clause had not been ruled on.\n\nHowever, Wase said the decision on clause 52 had already been taken.\n\nAt this point, the minority caucus protested and walked out of the chamber.\n\nThe bill should have been passed on Thursday but for the rowdy session which later led to some lawmakers engaging in physical combat.\n\nElumelu: Process, a Sham\n\nAddressing journalists, alongside other opposition lawmakers after staging a walkout, Elumelu stated categorically that the man that spoke on behalf of the NCC told lies.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI am happy that you are asking this question and that informs why I stood up to ask him whether this is his usual person because, in our opinion, he was telling lies. And because he was telling lies, I brought up an Act that gives room for funds to be made available for places not served by the USPF. And he agreed 100 per cent that I was correct.\n\nAdding his voice, Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechuckwu said statistically, according to NCC reports, NCC had coverage for 109,000 polling units out of 119,000 polling units in 2018.\n\nHe said that means NCC did not have coverage for only 8,000 polling units.\n\nHe added, \u201cThat for me presupposes over 90 per cent coverage. Two, the reference that he made about 2G and 3G, each of these frequencies can transfer data. It is very clear. So what we are doing essentially is the rule of men and not the rule of our rules.\u201d\n\nElumelu pointed out that the walkout staged by the opposition lawmakers showed that they were disappointed in the action of Wase.\n\nHe further clarified that the issue of electronic transmission of results has nothing to do with opposition lawmakers because Hon. James Faleke of the APC also brought an amendment in agreement that results should be manually and electronically transmitted.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian people voted us to represent their interest. And in this electoral Act, we started very well, when it got to clause 52 (2), which talks about the electronic transmission of results, we could not agree as to the mode of accepting, whether to go for electronic transmission or not. In that process, the Deputy Minority Leader moved for an amendment. In his amendment, he posited that amendment should read that the next election should be by electronic transmission of results and eventually the chairman sitting (Deputy Speaker Wase) refused to listen to the amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker tried to intervene and when we could not reach an agreement we had to adjourn and a decision was reached by the House that we should invite the INEC and NCC to talk about their ability to ensure that our results are transmitted electronically all over the country.\n\n\u201cBut to our greatest surprise, upon resumption this morning we found out that INEC was asked to stay back. We tried to inquire why, and they told us that it\u2019s because they do not want INEC to be seen to be biased and that was why they deprived INEC of coming. In the NCC itself also, they asked the Executive Vice Chairman not to show up and thereby he resulted in asking somebody in the capacity of a director to show up. Even the Director himself couldn\u2019t even substantiate issues.\u201d\n\nElumelu said it was because Wase refused to allow them to move for recission on Clause 52(2) that forced them to walkout.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice than to say that we cannot be part of that fake process where they\u2019re depriving Nigerians of their right for their results to be counted accurately. Because e-transmission will guard against rigging and votes can count. But what they\u2019ve done is to discountenance our agitations that let there be transparency in the next conduct of our elections,\u201d he said.\n\nElumeku said whatever they did was a nullity, while insisting that they would continue their agitation when they resume from their annual recess.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the House Committee on INEC, Hon. Aisha Dukku, while briefing journalists said the House in its wisdom accepted the recommendation of the committee without alteration.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhat happened yesterday led to the adjournment of the House to today and by the ruling of yesterday. NCC was invited because they have the technical knowledge to inform us so that we make decisions with an informed mind. The experts came and enlightened us. What NCC confirmed is that we have 50 per cent coverage and we have 2G/3G and that\u2019s not enough to transmit results. This is from NCC. We cannot afford to disenfranchise an eligible voter because each vote must count.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Hon. Mark Gbillah said that, as an expert in the industry, transmission of results does not have to be by broadband.\n\nHe stated: \u201cLet me, first of all, clarify that point further as a professional in the industry. First and foremost, when you talk about 3G and 2G and LTE, which he failed to mention, these are technologies that have to do with transmission by the Internet or broadband. Now transmission of results does not have to be by broadband. I am surprised that somebody who is supposed to be a professional in the NCC does not know that difference.\n\n\u201cThis USSD function just uses the GSM network. That is all that we need. Like text messages that is all that is required to transmit results. We do not need internet service and we have more than 90 per cent coverage of that.\n\n\u201cAnd what the leader was saying about the USPF is something that this House has to investigate. In 2006, the Universal Service Provision Fund (USFP) started to collect 2.5 per cent of the profit after tax of the telecoms operators to date. And their function is to be able to provide coverage in underserved and unserved areas of this country.\n\n\u201cNigerians need to know what has the USPF been doing? If in 2018, only 8,000 per cent units were not covered, by now obviously the telecoms operators on their own have covered it and if they say the operators have not covered it, USPF has enough funds. Six months is all it takes to cover 8,000 polling units. So there is no excuse for them to say that we cannot deploy or transmit results electronically. And I challenge the EVC of NCC to a public debate. I will personally be there to provide technical explanation and proof of what I am saying.\u201d\n\nNCC: 3G network, a necessity for E-transmission of results available in only 50% of polling units\n\nAt the resumed sitting yesterday, the NCC honoured the summons of the House to explain the practicability of electronic transmission of results.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the NCC team, the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, Engr. Ubale Maska said Nigeria does not have an adequate network covering the 119,000 polling units across the country to enable the seamless electronic transmission of election results.\n\nHe added that in all the polling units studied in 2018, only about 50% have 2G and 3G networks, stressing that the 4G network only exists where there is the 3G network, therefore making the coverage inadequate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It continues to violate civil and political rights with impunity,\u201d CORE said in a statement.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe arrest of five youths for wearing \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d T-shirts to a church is absurd. The arrest of 47 unarmed persons participating in a peaceful ethnic-nationalist demonstration for self-determination and refusal to grant them bail is equally repressive.\n\n\u201cAnd the \u201carrest\u201d of Nnamdi Kanu of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) smacks of the same cloak and dagger attempt to abduct Umaru Dikko from London in 1984 when a military junta led by the same Muhammadu Buhari held Nigeria in a vice grip of state terror on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWe realize that these are acts to curtail justified and popular anger due to the APC\u2019s failure as a ruling party. But we will not submit to these reactionary attacks.\n\n\u201cThe regime has failed on each of the three pillars of empty promises on which bases it came to power. The economic hardships of poor working people have worsened, corruption stinks to the high heavens under APC as much as it did with the PDP, and assurances of bringing the war with Boko Haram in the northeast have been replaced with the excruciating reality of generalized insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe APC regime\u2019s deceit of \u201cchange\u201d has revealed itself for what it is. We can stop this monster and the system it represents only by fighting against every infraction of injustice it metes out to us. This includes demanding justice, as is the case for over a hundred people killed during the #EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cIt is in this sense that the Judicial Panels of Inquiry into SARS-related killings is of utmost importance. The regime's lies about the extent of that dastardly demonstration of state terrorism have been torn aside at the Lagos State panel.\n\n\u201cEvidence of the killing of at least 98 people has been presented to the Lagos State panel, with autopsy reports backing these. But, while the judicial process is still ongoing, the panel has declared that it is winding up. According to the chair of the panel, Doris T. Okuwobi, this is at the order of the presidency. All the panels of inquiry on SARS across the country are to wind up and submit their reports to the National Council of State by this month. Consequently, the Lagos panel intends to wind up proceedings by 19 July, despite tons of unresolved cases before it.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the government set up the panels as a mere token to appease mass anger. It is not interested in justice because its hands are covered with the blood of slain Nigerians in the first place. But these panels have now been used for expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, and the regime wants to silence the people. We say a loud no to this tampering with justice and continued reign of injustice in the land.\u201d",

It continues to violate civil and political rights with impunity,\u201d CORE said in a statement.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe arrest of five youths for wearing \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d T-shirts to a church is absurd. The arrest of 47 unarmed persons participating in a peaceful ethnic-nationalist demonstration for self-determination and refusal to grant them bail is equally repressive.\n\n\u201cAnd the \u201carrest\u201d of Nnamdi Kanu of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) smacks of the same cloak and dagger attempt to abduct Umaru Dikko from London in 1984 when a military junta led by the same Muhammadu Buhari held Nigeria in a vice grip of state terror on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWe realize that these are acts to curtail justified and popular anger due to the APC\u2019s failure as a ruling party. But we will not submit to these reactionary attacks.\n\n\u201cThe regime has failed on each of the three pillars of empty promises on which bases it came to power. The economic hardships of poor working people have worsened, corruption stinks to the high heavens under APC as much as it did with the PDP, and assurances of bringing the war with Boko Haram in the northeast have been replaced with the excruciating reality of generalized insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe APC regime\u2019s deceit of \u201cchange\u201d has revealed itself for what it is. We can stop this monster and the system it represents only by fighting against every infraction of injustice it metes out to us. This includes demanding justice, as is the case for over a hundred people killed during the #EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cIt is in this sense that the Judicial Panels of Inquiry into SARS-related killings is of utmost importance. The regime's lies about the extent of that dastardly demonstration of state terrorism have been torn aside at the Lagos State panel.\n\n\u201cEvidence of the killing of at least 98 people has been presented to the Lagos State panel, with autopsy reports backing these. But, while the judicial process is still ongoing, the panel has declared that it is winding up. According to the chair of the panel, Doris T. Okuwobi, this is at the order of the presidency. All the panels of inquiry on SARS across the country are to wind up and submit their reports to the National Council of State by this month. Consequently, the Lagos panel intends to wind up proceedings by 19 July, despite tons of unresolved cases before it.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that the government set up the panels as a mere token to appease mass anger. It is not interested in justice because its hands are covered with the blood of slain Nigerians in the first place. But these panels have now been used for expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, and the regime wants to silence the people. We say a loud no to this tampering with justice and continued reign of injustice in the land.\u201d",

          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "If you\u2019re like me, then your face may be constantly buried in your phone screen. If you\u2019re not scrolling through your favourite social media, you\u2019re having a field day chatting with friends and family.\n\nMost times, I\u2019m scrolling through a sea of cartoonish yellow faces that describe how I feel because sometimes, words aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIn a world where more people work from home and attend events on Zoom, everyone is likely staring at a screen for the better part of the day. How can we not? It\u2019s how we bridge distance barriers and insulate ourselves from a deadly pandemic.\n\nA South African study on changes in how people perceive technology by Alex Emilio Fischer, Tanya Van Tonder, and other researchers reveals 83% of 405 respondents interviewed, worked and communicated more with technology since COVID-19 became a global pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, talking to someone physically differs from conversing using a 6.5\u201d device. When communicating face-to-face, what you don\u2019t say is more important than what you say.\n\nFacial cues and body language speak louder than you can imagine. Lydia Ramsey, Professional Speaker and Author, says that \u201cEye contact is the most obvious way you communicate. When you are looking at the other person, you show interest.\u201d\n\nRamsey claims studies show that words account for 7% of human communication while body language and tone account for 55% and 38%, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays, the way we primarily communicate doesn\u2019t accommodate body language. It\u2019s left to collect dust behind computer screens and beneath our typing thumbs.\n\nMelanie Chan, Senior Lecturer, Media, Communication and Culture at Leeds Beckett University, feels technology has reduced face-to-face conversations.\n\nInterestingly, we not only talk through our devices, we also speak to them. Smartphone assistants have become so intelligent that I sometimes find myself asking Google Assistant to tell me jokes when I\u2019m bored.\n\nWhile technology has reduced physical communication, it has also helped us keep in touch where actual meetings are impossible. And with the aid of Japanese invention, emojis, we are perhaps retaining some aspects of normal communication.\n\nEmojis: the language of the digital world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Denis Cherkashin on Unsplash\n\nWhen we click on the emoji section of our keyboard, we likely want to convey emotion easily, or words aren\u2019t enough to say what we feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmojis first appeared on Japanese mobile phones in the late \u201990s. Since then, they have evolved into a universal digital language. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named an emoji Word of the Year. Can you guess which one it was? Reply in the comments.\n\nThe popularity of emojis in Japan propelled Google and Apple to have them registered by Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organisation that maintains text standards on computers.\n\nLike the English language, more emojis are being added to the \u201cemoji vocabulary\u201d to express more emotions.\n\nEmojis also have a day set aside to celebrate them. Bizarre? Apparently, World Emoji Day is a big deal.\n\nCreated by Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia \u2014 a wiki for emojis \u2014 the day has two main activities: awards are given to the most popular emojis and new ones are announced.\n\nInterestingly, World Emoji Day is celebrated on July 17 because Apple\u2019s iOS calendar emoji have the same date. Not to worry, you\u2019ll also see the same on your Google keyboard if you\u2019re an Android user.\n\nWhile emojis might be a universal way of communication digitally, it is still perceived differently by people.\n\nWhat do users think of emojis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can lose nuances of humour, seriousness and even sarcasm when we take words at face value.\u201d This is what Folakemi Olaniyan, final year student of English and Literary Studies, said when I asked her how important she felt emojis were.\n\nTo her, emojis help to define the mood and tone of written text. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can chat and not use emojis,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, as much as she wants to, Olaniyan does not use emojis in a formal setting. She prefers chatting on her phone to having a physical conversation, adding that it saves her from stuttering in real life.\n\nIn contrast, Kunle Agbetiloye, a journalist, prefers physical conversations to any form of digital exchange. But, like Olaniyan, he believes emojis give more meaning to words.\n\n\u201cThere are some statements one makes that need an emoji for the receiver to understand the emotion that accompanies it,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, Agbetiloye maintains that emojis are only necessary for informal conversations. \u201cPersonally, if I feel angry, I won\u2019t send you angry emojis because of its cartoonish look.\u201d\n\nTo test his assertion, during a lull in the conversation, I sent him an angry face emoji. True to form, he didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n\nMy chat with Daniel Whyte, another journalist, was filled with emojis. From how the conversation went, I could deduce just how important emojis were.\n\nFor Whyte, emojis help get the message across faster. In his words, \u201cI use it to communicate simple messages quickly. It saves time and flows easily.\u201d He ends this sentence with a smiling face emoji, expressing how casually the words would have flowed from his mouth in a physical conversation.\n\nLike Olaniyan and Agbetiloye, Whyte maintains that emojis should be reserved for casual conversations and kept from official emails.\n\nUniversal but personal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVyvyan Evans, Linguistics Professor and Author of The Emoji Code: Linguistics Behind Smiley Faces and Scaredy Cats, describes emojis as \u201cincontrovertibly the world\u2019s first truly universal form of communication.\u201d\n\nHowever, emojis are used by people from different cultures and with unique personalities, making meaning relative to who is using them. As a result, emoji translators were created.\n\nUsually, the thumbs-up emoji is understood as commendation or approval, but in Greek culture, it\u2019s an offensive gesture.\n\nInterestingly, the smiling face emoji symbolises dismissiveness to Chinese people rather than happiness.\n\nRanti Omoloso, a recent university graduate, says he has difficulty chatting with older people as they often misunderstand emojis.\n\n\u201cI try to avoid chatting with parents cause they seem to understand emojis very differently. I don\u2019t like typing long sentences, so I just put a call through,\u201d he says.\n\nKeith Broni, who makes a living from translating emojis, says they are \u201clinguistics tools that are being used to complement our language.\u201d\n\nAlthough Broni believes emojis by themselves cannot be a form of communication, he admits that they play a vital role in digital communication.\n\nAn expert\u2019s take\n\nIn the opinion of Dr Oluwakemi Omole, Assistant Director, Counselling and Human Development Centre, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, communication is an exchange of information, and the medium doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nHighlighting the importance of communication, she says it improves our psychology and sense of self. \u201cIt is very important to our psyche as humans.\u201d\n\nShe also admits that while physical contact feels good, presence \u2014 online or physical \u2014 is what matters most. \u201cYou can be physically present with someone, and you\u2019re not communicating. It\u2019s about exchange and the ability to listen.\u201d\n\nAs a psychologist, Omole says a lot of research has gone into how effective emojis are and if they communicate feelings that cannot be easily expressed in words. She concludes that \u201cemoji is a way of bridging the gap. It is a way of letting people know what you would love to express to them.\u201d\n\nAddressing the question of emojis being a universal language, Omole refutes their ability to be understood universally. \u201cAlthough we feel the same things, the way we express them may differ across cultures.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s World Emoji Day promises the release of emoji 14.0. A new series of emojis that take into account race and gender. With the emoji vocabulary being updated frequently, could they become a stand-alone language?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019.

Today, in Brazil only, we\u2019re starting a test (on Android and iOS) for one of those new capabilities. It\u2019s called Fleets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the number of people joining the conversation with Fleets did not increase. Brown\u2019s blog post revealed that the feature was used mostly as a means of promoting tweets by people who already tweet frequently.\n\nSocial media and disappearing posts\n\nDisappearing posts was first seen on Snapchat with its introduction of Stories in October 2013. It was described as a \u201cnew way to share your day with friends.\u201d The posts last for 24 hours after which they\u2019ll no longer be seen.\n\nThe feature was introduced on Instagram in August 2016. Like Snapchat, Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours of posting. More social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and networking platform, LinkedIn, soon added the feature.\n\nAfter the feature launched on Twitter newly, it suffered stability problems due to heavy usage. Twitter Support tweeted that the rollout of Fleets would be slowed down to \u201cfix some performance and stability problems. If you don\u2019t have the feature yet, you may not get it for a few more days.\u201d\n\nWhile this means the feature was catching on in the beginning, it is not clear why its use reduced.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Twitter declined to give statistics on the usage of Fleets.\n\nHowever, Instagram, claims its Stories see 500 million interactions daily, influencer marketing agency, Mediakix says 150 million \u2014 10% \u2014 of Facebook\u2019s 1.45 billion daily users use Facebook stories. Statista also reveals that daily WhatsApp status users were up to 500 million in Q1 2019.\n\nWith no available data on other platforms\u2019 disappearing posts feature usage, could this mean we\u2019ll see more apps scrap it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter says it has learned from Fleets and will focus on creating other ways to encourage people to join the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Following England\u2019s defeat to Italy in a tense penalty shoot-out at the UEFA Euro 2020 final played in Wembley stadium, thousands of racist abuses have been hurled at the three of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka for missing their penalty kicks.\n\nThe two teams played to a 1-1 tie, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka were among England\u2019s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the match and the tournament. All three missed their shots.\n\nAfter the game ended the players\u2019 social media accounts, including Facebook-owned Instagram and Twitter, were filled with racist comments and messages.\n\nEngland Football Association, FIFA, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince William have issued solidarity statements and condemned the attacks.\n\nRead Also: Racism against African people is finding safe haven in the international air transport \u2013 Travel services industry\n\nLewis Hamilton, an influential Black sporting figure and Formula 1\u2019s seven-time world champion, voiced his condemnation of the attack and the underlying issues faced by minorities in sport.\n\n\u201cThe pressure to deliver is felt by every sportsperson but when you are a minority representing your country, this is a layered experience. Success would feel like a double victory, but a miss feels like a two-fold failure when it\u2019s compounded with racist abuse. We must work towards a society that doesn\u2019t require Black players to prove their value or place in society only through victory.\u201d\n\nTwitter reportedly removed over 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended accounts that targeted abuse at the England players, as did Facebook and Instagram. A real estate service provider suspended an employee as they looked into racist tweets made by the employee. And a right-wing political commentator and comedian also faced scrutiny following their comments.\n\nRead Also: Racism and ethnic jingoism\n\nBut despite this outpouring of support, there is still much to be done to address the larger societal issues of racism in sports and create safe digital spaces.\n\nRacism in sports\n\nThis is not the first time fans have taken to social media platforms to racially abuse players or sports personalities. Studies have shown that domestic violence surges after a football match ends. One study found that reports of domestic violence in the northwest of England during three football World Cups went up by 26 percent when the national team won or drew, and by 38 percent when the team lost.\n\nSports have also been at the centre on racial discrimination at all levels. For example, during and before the Euro 2020, the England team kneeled before kick-off in solidarity against racism and inequality but some fans booed this gesture.\n\nMarcus Rashford, who has helped British schools tackle child hunger, has constantly highlighted the racist abuse that continues to be targeted towards him.\n\nLaw against racist abusers\n\nUnder regulations from 1989 designed to deter offensive behavior, those who hurl racist abuses at players from the stands at stadiums are banned from attending matches. But the rules do not cover online trolling \u2014 of which there is plenty.\n\nEnglish prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that the order would be extended to cover online racism.\n\nThe change came after efforts by fans to insist that more needed to be done.\n\nThree women, Shaista Aziz, Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, who describe themselves as the \u201cThree Hijabis\u201d because they are Muslim and wear hijabs, led much of the push among fans to stop future perpetrators both online and offline from watching soccer in a stadium, launching a petition on Change.org titled \u201cBan racists for life from all football matches in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the Football Association and the government to work together now to ban all those who have carried out racist abuse, online or offline, from all football matches in England for life,\u201d the trio wrote, targeting the campaign at the prime minister, the Football Association, and Secretary of State Oliver Dowden.\n\nOver 1 million people had signed their names \u2014 a figure that continues to climb as people across the nation learn of the women\u2019s efforts and share the petition.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Abdullatif said the response to the petition has been \u201cincredible\u201d and promised that the group\u2019s work was just beginning.\n\n\u201cWe need to see action. We need to ensure we\u2019re not just talking, which we\u2019ve done many times before about racism in football. Words alone don\u2019t create change,\u201d she said. \u201cThose perpetrating this behavior need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAbdullatif, who is based in Manchester, said she and the other activists hope the petition will prompt a response from the Football Association and help to implement meaningful action.\n\nTwitter and Facebook response\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said the \u201cabhorrent, racist abuse directed at England players\u201d had no place on the platform. Since the end of Sunday\u2019s game, Twitter removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts.\n\nThe spokesperson did not say how many accounts were suspended for violating its rules against harassment and hateful content. \u201cWe have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our partners across the football community to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour \u2014 both online and offline,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said the company didn\u2019t have numbers to share but said the platform \u201cquickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England\u2019s footballers last night and we\u2019ll continue to take action against those that break our rules.\u201d The spokesperson added that the company had encouraged all players to turn on Instagram\u2019s hidden words tool, which prevents abuse or comments from being visible in direct messages.\n\nFA\u2019s role\n\nEngland\u2019s Football Association said that it was \u201cappalled by the online racism that has been aimed at some of our England players on social media.\u201d Anyone behind the \u201cdisgusting\u201d behavior is not welcome as a fan, the FA said, adding it was supporting the players \u201cwhile urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible.\u201d\n\nThe FA statement added that social media companies \u201cneed to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making the platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s players were frequently booed by fans at Wembley Stadium during the tournament when the players kneeled on the field before matches as an anti-racism gesture. Both teams kneeled before the start of Sunday\u2019s match, as well.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was criticized for previously failing to defend the players who kneeled before games, tweeted Monday that the players \u201cdeserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media.\u201d\n\nSouthgate comments\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate also condemned the racist social media attacks as \u201cunforgivable\u201d\n\nSouthgate added that his team had \u201cbeen a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor some of them to be abused is unforgivable really.

          "title": "10 Reasons Executive Management Should Leverage Emotional Intelligence",
          "text": "To quote the immortal words of John C. Maxwell, \u201ceverything rises and falls on leadership\u201d. Emotional intelligence is such a fundamental requirement for executive management such that without it their performance will be greatly stunted. Managing people and resources requires specific skillsets that enable productivity and profitability because the decisions that are taken on critical issues have immediate and future impact on the fortunes of the organization.\n\nBeing emotional is one thing, being emotionally intelligent is another thing altogether. Many leaders fail to realize that many decisions are made from a place of emotions and if those emotions are not educated, the dysfunction and chaos that will be unleashed in the workplace is better imagined. Executive management especially has to come to terms with its ability to interact with the subordinate levels of leadership in a cohesive manner via the agency of emotional intelligence. Below are some tips that might be helpful.\n\nAvoidance of Ambiguity\n\nOne of the perks of an emotionally intelligent executive management team is the ability to achieve clarity. This is manifested in many ways from strategic objectives to operational deliverables. The allocation and appropriation of resources is a tell-tale sign of whether or not it has an awareness of the competing interests and stakeholders of the organization. For example, when there is an inability to effectively communicate the goal of the top hierarchy to mid-level leaders or supervisors \u2013 who in turn convey muddled messaging to their subordinates.\n\nImagine that executive management is looking at improving the growth metrics of an organization but fails to lay out the specific parameters of what it considers to be acceptable growth, mid-management might have a different (and lower) standard of growth and when this trickles down to the people are the bottom of the leadership ladder, the overall outcome will certainly be mediocre compared to the ambitious goals the executive management originally had.\n\nImproves The Ability To Listen To Others\n\nOne of the illusions of top leadership like an executive management team is the conceited believe that they are a bunch of gods who, given their position in the organization, are heads above everyone else. Nothing could be further from the truth. Emotional intelligence helps executive management teams to take a step back to accommodate the feedback they get from lower tiers of leadership because it is easy to get stuck in a bubble of assumed knowledge. Especially when it comes to designing the customer experience, the staff members who are closest to the final consumers should have significant contributions to what changes are made to products and services that will yield the greatest utility and ensure a highly satisfied customer base.\n\nHelps To Anchor Solutions\n\nThe natural instinct most times with troubleshooting is to assume that the challenge is caused by others, emotional intelligence when applied correctly may reveal that the problem may be with the systems not the people. For example, when a printing machine isn\u2019t churning out the expected quota of published material per day owing to engineering faults \u2013 an emotionally intelligent executive management will seek to interrogate the immediate and remote causes of such a shortfall instead of a knee-jerk reaction like issuing the production manager a query.\n\nSuch executive management will focus on providing the necessary conditions for productivity instead of unduly wielding the big stick. At other times, it may be that the person or people in charge of production are incompetent \u2013 what emotional intelligence helps out with is the identification of the difference so that appropriate action can be taken.\n\nHelps To Manage Diversity\n\nExecutive management doesn\u2019t only manage competences, they manage the demography of the organization. In an age where inclusion is becoming a staple in corporate organization, it is amongst the responsibility of executive management to always ensure that the composition of the workforce from top to bottom isn\u2019t disproportionately skewed \u2013 with exceptions where the very nature of the job requires specific staff.\n\nEmotional intelligence especially at the recruitment stage will factor in these nuances that foster a healthy work community. The male to female ratio, the race ratio, the age distribution, inclusion of persons with disability are important parameters to gauging the diversity quotient of the organization \u2013 some laws provide a statutory quota for minority groups such as persons with disabilities. It the job of the executive management to be abreast of these requirements.\n\nBrings About Better Negotiations\n\nMore often than not, executive management get to enter into business transactions with third-parties on behalf of the organizations. So if they are to properly present and protect the organization\u2019s interests, they have to be armed with a high level of emotional intelligence because their actions or inactions can make or mar the fortunes of the organization they represent. Emotional intelligence comprises a knowledge on not just oneself but also of others. This awareness can be weaponized via research and market intelligence.\n\nDuring the course of engaging external stakeholders or players, executive management seeks to maximize the strengths of the organization to get the best deals. Indomie for instance is aware of its brand superiority and they sell their products at a slightly higher price to distributors, ordinarily the higher retail prices should depress sales but they know that most children prefer Indomie over generic or competing noodle brands, hence the price bump isn\u2019t an issue. Same applies to partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. Access Bank acquired Diamond Bank and the former retained its eponymous brand.\n\nBetter Motivated and More Productive Teams\n\nExecutive teams that have a high level of emotional intelligence connect with their teams in ways that the lack of such skill can\u2019t. Famed business leader, Dale Carnegie submits that, \u201cWhen dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.\u201d Some of the innate desires of humans include the need to be respected, recognized, rewarded etc. Knowing what to do, when to do it and how to best do it is a rare skill that if applied correctly by the executive team can greatly improve outcomes.\n\nBetter Conflict Management\n\nWhere two or three human being converge and interact, conflict is inevitable. So emotional intelligence helps executive management contain tension among/within internal or external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders include shareholders, employees etc. External stakeholders include customers and regulators etc. What happens when shareholders pass a vote of no confidence on the executive team?\n\nWhat happens when employees down tools to protest the lack of a conducive work environment? What happens when regulators flags a company\u2019s product or process for not following best practices? What happens when customers boycott the organization\u2019s products and services owing to the failure of a brand to include an advertised feature? 1Over 30% of Basecamp employees, comprising most founding staff, recently left the company en masse, in protest of an new directive against political comments in the workplace. Emotional intelligence could have helps the executive management better manage this conflict.\n\nRead also: Trust, an emotional core of leadership\n\nTalent Acquisition\n\nGenerally, talent acquisition is left for the human resource department but the playbook for hiring new staff is usually routed through the executive management. An avatar of the ideal candidate should be clearly articulate and the parameters for screening also well documented. In top level recruitment however, especially c-suite positions, the executive management directly oversees the process. Many candidates come in looking and sounding like the best thing since sliced bread but upon technical interrogation and examination, the well-disguised incompetence will be unearthed.\n\nMany candidates sometimes possess all the right qualifications on paper but a diligent engagement by a team of emotionally intelligent interviewers will probe further to reveal their soft skills and other social traits that may either be a good add or a minus to the team. Emotional intelligence is so critical in talent acquisition because if all that is achieved is to stop the wrong candidate from infiltrating the corporate fabric of the organization, that counts as a huge achievement.\n\nFor Business Organizational (Re) Structuring\n\nBusinesses shouldn\u2019t just be organizations, they should be organisms \u2013 alive and responsive to their internal and external environments. Changes like mergers and acquisition, loss of key staff, expansion and the rests are commonplace, what should also be commonplace is the emotional intelligence required to deal with these changes. The executive management can arrive at an important conclusion that the current business model isn\u2019t viable nor sustainable and that it needs to pivot or expand into other markets.\n\nBy and large, it will have the same human and material resources currently at its disposal \u2013 emotional intelligence in (re)allocating such is considered key. Samsung, a South Korean brand with great social awareness transformed from exporting dried fish to producing top tier electronics amongst other things and they have been unstoppable ever since.\n\nA Much Improved Work Environment and Culture\n\nIt is often said that the intangibles greatly determine the tangibles, even if employees of an organization are well-paid and are equipped with the facilities and resources required to discharge their duties, a toxic attitude can still dampen the overarching systems of the organization. Executive management must realize that when there is no unity of purpose, where staff are better at office politics than they are at their tasks, where the voices of junior staff aren\u2019t heard \u2013 the organization will slowly but sure morph into den of saboteurs as opposed to a team of collaborators.\n\n1https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/",

          "title": "By frustrating electronic transmission of election results, Nigerian lawmakers hinder INEC\u2019s independence, efficiency",
          "text": "In an unprecedented legislative manoeuvre, the electoral act was, this week, passed by both chambers of Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly.\n\nIts passage was not without drama, chaos and what looked like well-choreographed political trickery.\n\nThe most contentious clause in the bill which pitched the lawmakers, most of whom voted along party lines, against one another was section 52(3).\n\nThe section states that \u201cthe commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nHowever, lawmakers of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were opposed to the provision and many of them voted against the clause.\n\nThe Senate Deputy Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, took the lead for his caucus, when he moved that the section be amended, one that was challenged by the opposition caucuses.\n\n\u201cThe commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly,\u201d his proposition read.\n\nWhen Mr Abdullahi\u2019s position was put to vote, 52 senators voted in favour while 28 voted against, with 28 absentees, exclusive of the Senate President.\n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s adjournment because the session turned rowdy, the House of Representatives passed the bill in spite of a walkout staged by lawmakers of the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nAs it stands, it effectively means the electoral commission (INEC) has been denied the legal power to transmit results of elections electronically.\n\nMuch to the consternation of the main opposition PDP and many election monitoring groups, the lawmakers empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Assembly to determine the use of electronic transmission in an election.\n\nIt thus means that federal lawmakers have successfully unbundled the roles of INEC into four agencies.\n\nThe commission\u2019s only job now is to conduct election. The NCC would suggest e-transmission of results, while the National Assembly would ratify the suggestion. Already, an electoral offences commission bill is still receiving legislative tending.\n\nCeding the power to determine the use of electronic transmission in an election to political office holders and politicians opens another can of uncertainties, analysts believe.\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission is an agency under the ministry of communications and digital economy and the appointment of its director-general is under the purview of the president.\n\nBy implication, the agency\u2019s director-general works on the mandate of the president as well as the minister of communications. Such officials seldom go against the wish of the president who can thus decide whether or not Nigerians should experience electronic transmission of election results.\n\nAnalysts say INEC\u2019s dependence on such agency to take a decision that grossly affects an election undermines the electoral body\u2019s independence.\n\nAlready, questions have been raised about INEC\u2019s independence and there have been concerted advocacy to make the commission more independent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe voting pattern during the deliberation about the bill shows that a bulk of federal lawmakers are opposed to the digitisation of the electoral process.\n\nWhat the intrigues that culminated into the passage of the bill, particularly among APC lawmakers, suggest is that they have vested interest in a non-digitized voting process.\n\nFor one, the statutory chairman of the committee of the whole, Deputy Speaker Idris Wase (APC, Plateau), did not hide his opposition to the clause so much that some lawmakers accused him of rigging the process, an allegation he denied.\n\nHe argued that those without network coverage would be disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that only less than 20 per cent of my constituency has network coverage,\u201d he said at the plenary on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to our brothers in Maiduguri, Yobe where masts are down,\u201d he added, amid interruptions from his colleagues.\n\nAn alternative amendment by James Faleke (APC, Lagos) suggested that the section cater to the two sides of the divide by providing that \u201celection results may be transmitted both electronically and manually.\u201d\n\nHis suggestion fell flat.\n\nA representative of the NCC, Adeleke Adewolu, would tell the House members that only about \u201c50.3 per cent of polling stations in Nigeria have facilities for transmission of results.\u201d\n\nHe added that only about 50 per cent of polling units in the country have a 3G network that can transmit election results electronically.\n\nMeanwhile, in NCC\u2019s draft consultation document for the deployment of 5G mobile technology in the country, as of December 2019, the coverage data of rural areas shows that 2G networks has coverage of 89.8 per cent, while 3G has coverage of over 74 per cent, much more than the figure Mr Adewolu told lawmakers.\n\nThe latest 4G network has reached about 37 per cent of the population of the country covered at the same time, with less than 10 per cent connections leading to mobile Internet penetration of about 32 per cent. Major telecommunication networks in the country have also reported a yearly uptick in their 4G reach.\n\nLawmakers Can Stall Implementation\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmakers have a habit of stalling legislative duties they are required to sanction before such could be implemented.\n\nParagraph 3 of the third schedule of the Nigerian constitution empowers the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) to retain in its custody details of assets declared by public office holders and make them available for inspection upon request by any citizen of Nigeria, on the terms and conditions prescribed by the National Assembly.\n\nRepeated calls by Nigerians demanding the CCB to publicise the asset details of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have been turned down, according to the bureau\u2019s chairman, Mohammed Isah, because \u201cthe National Assembly has not set the guidelines for the Bureau to do so.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the electoral act provision would be treated differently, but the lawmakers\u2019 disposition towards the election digitisation clause does not instil much optimism.\n\nYet those who oppose online electronic systems have cited possibility of hacking as one of their fears. Some federal lawmakers also nurse this fear.\n\nIn response to those in this camp, one of Africa\u2019s foremost think-tanks, CDD-West Africa, said that \u201cthe benefits to transmitting results electronically are significant and that there are ways to protect the system and integrity of the outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCDD-West Africa sees benefits in an electronic system that can both record votes digitally and produce an instantaneous paper record of each vote (a digital receipt and ballot paper showing only the party voted for) to be received by the voter and inserted in a secure box for later cross-referencing with the electronically transmitted results. A valid result, therefore, will be one where the digital and paper records correspond,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cCDD-West Africa\u2019s strong preference for fully digitising the process is based on the well-documented and chaotic nature of the current manual results collation and tabulation system.\u201d\n\nAnother monitoring group, YIAGA Africa, said the digitized voting process was a no-brainer because the traditional manual means \u201chas increasingly become susceptible to manipulation, fraudulent (and)\u2026 wrong computation of results, violence and attacks on election officials.\u201d\n\nIt added that INEC has shown its capacity to deploy technology in transmitting results from the polling units level alongside the manual collation of results during the Edo and Ondo 2020 governorship election.\n\nAlthough the electoral body did it without having a specific legal pass, the group said the successes recorded during the last elections were pointers to what INEC could do if backed by the law, without any third party\u2019s interference.\n\n(This report is a partnership between Premium Times and the Centre for Democracy and Development focused on strengthening Nigeria\u2019s electoral system).",
          "summary": "\u201cThe commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly,\u201d his proposition read.\nAs it stands, it effectively means the electoral commission (INEC) has been denied the legal power to transmit results of elections electronically.\nSuch officials seldom go against the wish of the president who can thus decide whether or not Nigerians should experience electronic transmission of election results.\nAnalysts say INEC\u2019s dependence on such agency to take a decision that grossly affects an election undermines the electoral body\u2019s independence.\nAn alternative amendment by James Faleke (APC, Lagos) suggested that the section cater to the two sides of the divide by providing that \u201celection results may be transmitted both electronically and manually.\u201dHis suggestion fell flat.",

          "text": "*Accuses Buhari of hypocrisy and deceit on open grazing\n\n*Demands apology and same gesture\n\nAgency Reports\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue state has accused President Buhari of deceit and hypocrisy over his stand on open grazing for cattle.\n\nOrtom at an interview drew attention to Buhari\u2019s duplicity following revelations that he approved N6.25 billion for his home state of Katsina to create cattle ranches, while canvassing for cattle routes and open grazing in other states.\n\nHe spoke at the Makurdi Airport on Saturday.\n\nOrtom insisted that the Federal Government should apologise to him and extend the same gesture to Benue State by releasing N100billion for the establishment of ranches.\n\n\u201cSo Mr. President approved N6.5billion for ranching in Katsina state. What kind of hypocrisy is this? Are we a serious country at all?\n\n\u201cIf the President would say that the Attorney General of the Federation should ensure the relocation of those who have encroached on cattle routes and grazing areas to do open grazing despite the surge in the population from less than 40 million in 1950 and the over 200million people today; and the same President is encouraging ranching in Katsina state where he comes from, that is certainly laughable and very hypocritical and deceitful.\n\n\u201cWe need an explanation because it is a shame. Since 2017 we have been for ranching and of course you recall that the Governor of Katsina state did say that it is un-Islamic for anybody to talk about open grazing.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition of open grazing is the only thing that will help this country including the provision for ranching. So if the president has approved N6.5billion for Katsina state, they should also approve N100billion for Benue state with an apology to me.\n\n\u201cIt is not right for the Federal Government to approve money for ranching in a state and leave others out. And in fact ,the Governor of the state in his remark said N5billion had already been remitted to their coffers.\n\n\u201cSo I begin to wonder, where are we headed?\u201d",

          "text": "By Rotimi Ijikanmi\n\nThe Federal Government says, in line with operative conventions and laws, it will take possession of the 1,130 looted Benin bronzes being expected from Germany.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed disclosed this on Saturday in Lagos at a news conference on the efforts by the federal government to repatriate looted smuggled artefacts from around the world.\n\nMohammed was reacting to the controversy that had trailed who will take the possession of the expected artefact between the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II and Edo state Governor, Godwin Obaseki.\n\nWhile the Oba wanted the artefacts stolen from Benin Palace in 1987 to be returned to a museum to be built within the Palace premises, the governor showed preference for a private trust to take custody and manage the artefacts,\n\nThe Minister however said the federal government was the entity recognised by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from the country.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany.\n\n\u201cLet me state clearly here that, in line with international best practice and the operative Conventions and laws, the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of Nigeria and Germany.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the entity recognised by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe relevant international Conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister cited the 1970 UNESCO Convention, in its Article 1 which defines cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation.\n\nHe said the provision allows individual nations to determine what it regards as its cultural property.\n\nHe, however noted that the provision notwithstanding, his ministry had been working over the past years to repatriate looted artefacts in partnership with traditional institutions and state governments\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying in essence is that the federal government will take possession of these antiquities, because it is its duty to do so, in line with the extant laws.\n\n\u201cWe have always exercised this right in cognisance of that culture that produced the art works.\n\n\u201cThat is why the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments have always involved both the Edo State government and the Royal Benin Palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said the federal government was not just involved in the repatriation of Benin artefacts.\n\nHe said his ministry was also working on repatriating Ife Bronzes and Terracotta, Nok Terracotta, Owo Terracotta, the arts of the Benue River Valley, the Igbo Ukwu and the arts of Bida, Igala, Jukun etc.\n\nMohammed commended the Government of Germany for taking the lead in the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts that were looted from Nigeria and from the African continent.\n\n\u201cAs I said during the meeting in Berlin, we see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead.\n\nHe also applauded the development that the repatriation of the artefacts would be the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations and cultural diplomacy between Nigeria and Germany.\n\nHe disclosed that there would be archaeological training for Nigerians among other benefits accruing from the ongoing talks.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian side and the German side agreed to Nigeria\u2019s proposal to use the repatriated artefacts and other works of art to inspire Nigeria\u2019s Creative Industry towards realising its high potential.\n\n\u201cFor this and other purposes, it was agreed that the Germans will facilitate the establishment of an academy in Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister equally thanked Gov. Godwin Obaseki for his commitment as well as the Oba for sending the Benin Crown Prince, His Royal Highness Ezelekhae Ewuare, to be a part of the Nigerian delegation to Berlin.",

While the palace wants the artefacts kept in the Benin Royal Museum, which will be built within the palace, the state government wants the items preserved in the proposed Edo Museum of West African Arts.\n\nOba of Benin, Ewuare II insisted that the right and only legitimate destination of the about-to-be-repatriated artefacts was the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nHowever, the Government House had also quoted Obaseki as saying in Germany that a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum would be built in Benin to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday about the controversy surrounding the about-to-be-repatriated artefacts, the minister said, \u201cThe Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany.\n\nLet me state clearly here that, in line with international best practice and the operative Conventions and laws, the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of Nigeria and Germany. Nigeria is the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe relevant international Conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups. For example, the 1970 UNESCO Convention, in its Article 1, defines cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation.\n\n\u201cThis allows individual nations to determine what it regards as its cultural property. Nevertheless, the Nigerian state \u2013 through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments \u2013 has in working assiduously over the past years to repatriate our looted artefacts carried along with our important traditional institutions and state governments\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying in essence is that the Federal government will take possession of these antiquities, because it is its duty to do so, in line with the extant laws. But we have always exercised this right in cognisance of that culture that produced the artworks.\n\n\u201cThat is why the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments have always involved both the Edo State government and the Royal Benin Palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities.\n\n\u201cPlease note that we are not just involved in the repatriation of Benin artefacts. We are also working on repatriating Ife Bronzes and Terracotta, Nok Terracotta, Owo Terracotta, the arts of the Benue River Valley, the Igbo Ukwu, the arts of Bida, the arts of Igala, Jukun etc.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

The Constitution further provides that INEC operations shall not be subject to the direction of anybody or authority.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervision, undertaking, and organization of elections in Nigeria. Of course, the National Assembly has the power to flesh out the legal framework, but that has to be consistent with the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThese constitutional powers have been solely and exclusively prescribed by the Constitution to INEC, and cannot be shared with the NCC, or any other Authority, and certainly not a body unknown to the Constitution. The Senate decision to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections to NCC is consequently patently VOID, unconstitutional, and unlawful.\n\n\u201cWe had earlier counseled that the mode of conducting elections and in particular the transmission of votes be left with INEC who would monitor developments and determine at every election the type of technology to be deployed to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. INEC also has constitutional power backed by the Electoral Act to make rules and guidelines to ensure that every vote is counted and that every vote counts.\n\nHon Tambuwal added that if INEC determines that in any part of the country, electronic transmission is not possible, it would by regulations determine the appropriate thing to do.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the House of Representatives to call on INEC to address the House and nation on its readiness by 2023 to deploy electronic transmission technology for our elections, seems to be a wise one, I, therefore, commend the Leadership and Hon Members of the House for this decision and further admonish them to remain on the path of patriotism and deepening of our democracy by engendering and strengthening the free and fair electoral process\n\n\u201cIn any case, I still believe that the best option is to leave this matter in the hands of INEC.\n\n\u201cWe admonish INEC to be solely guided by the National interest and the desire of all Nigerians for a credible, free and fair elections in using its constitutional powers and in the deployment of error-free technology.\u201d",

          "text": "The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Chinese officials over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. This is Washington\u2019s latest effort to hold China accountable for what it calls an erosion of rule of law in the former British colony.\n\nThe sanctions, posted by the US Treasury Department on Friday, are aimed at individuals from China\u2019s Hong Kong liaison office, used by Beijing to orchestrate its policies in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe seven people added to Treasury\u2019s \u201cspecially designated nationals\u201d list were Chen Dong, He Jing, Lu Xinning, Qiu Hong, Tan Tienui, Yang Jianping, and Yin Zonghua, all deputy directors at the liaison office, according to online data.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Chinese officials over the past year had \u201csystematically undermined\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s democratic institutions, delayed elections, disqualified elected legislators from office, and arrested thousands for disagreeing with government policies.\n\n\u201cIn the face of Beijing\u2019s decisions over the past year that have stifled the democratic aspirations of people in Hong Kong, we are taking action. Today we send a clear message that the United States resolutely stands with Hong Kongers,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Treasury Department referred to a separate updated business advisory issued jointly with the departments of State, Commerce, and Homeland Security that highlighted US government concerns about the effect on international companies of Hong Kong\u2019s national security law.\n\nCritics say Beijing implemented that law last year to facilitate a crackdown on pro-democracy activists and a free press.\n\nThe advisory said companies face risks associated with electronic surveillance without warrants and the surrender of corporate and customer data to authorities, adding that individuals and businesses should be aware of the potential consequences of engaging with sanctioned individuals or entities.\n\nThe actions were announced just over a year after former President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong\u2019s special status under US law to punish China for what he called \u201coppressive actions\u201d against the territory.\n\nThe United States has already imposed sanctions on other senior officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and senior police officers, for their roles in curtailing political freedoms in the territory.\n\nHong Kong officials previously called those US sanctions \u201chostile acts of hegemony\u201d.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Xia Baolong, the director of China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was quoted by Hong Kong Free Press as saying that sanctions will \u201conly evoke our anger\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou would only lift a rock and drop it heavily on your own feet. The long river of history has proven countless times that victory must belong to the indomitable Chinese people!\u201d Xia said in a speech.\n\nAlso on Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s national security police searched the University of Hong Kong\u2019s student union, after the government and university officials denounced students for allegedly sympathising with a man who stabbed a police officer in early July.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said at a news conference on Thursday that the Chinese government had broken its commitment on how it would deal with Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nChina had promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing.\n\nSince China imposed the national security law to criminalise what it considers subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, most pro-democracy activists and politicians have found themselves ensnared by it or arrested for other reasons.\n\nApple Daily, Hong Kong\u2019s most vocal pro-democracy newspaper, was forced to end a 26-year run in June amid the crackdown that froze the company\u2019s funds.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news conference in Beijing before the actions were formally announced that the US should stop interfering in Hong Kong and that China would make a \u201cresolute, strong response\u201d.\n\nThe US has already imposed sanctions on other senior officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and senior police officers, for their roles in curtailing political freedoms in the territory [Isaac Lawrence/AFP]\n\nA source told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the White House was also reviewing a possible executive order to facilitate immigration from Hong Kong but that it was still not certain to be implemented.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman is preparing a visit to Japan, South Korea and Mongolia next week. The State Department\u2019s announcement of her trip made no mention of any stop in China, which had been anticipated in foreign policy circles and reported in some media.\n\nA senior State Department official told reporters on Friday that Washington was still in talks with Beijing over whether Sherman would visit China.\n\nThe US government on Tuesday also strengthened warnings to businesses about the growing risks of having supply-chain and investment-links to China\u2019s Xinjiang region, citing forced labour and human rights abuses there, which Beijing has denied.\n\n\u201cWe hope that any additional US actions related to Hong Kong will remain targeted, and that Washington will avoid policy choices detrimental to Hong Kong\u2019s people,\u201d Anna Ashton, the vice president of government affairs at the US-China Business Council, said about the advisory issued on Friday.\n\nThe South China Morning Post newspaper also said that the latest decision was greeted with a \u201ccollective shrug\u201d from analysts.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based news publication quoted former US Consul General in Hong Kong Richard Boucher as saying: \u201cEvery time there\u2019s some news of China putting more pressure on Hong Kong, there\u2019s commensurate pressure on the US side to do something. But they\u2019re running out of things to do.\u201d\n\nOther analysts were also reported as saying that the move is more symbolic, as the US is \u201ccaught between pressure to respond to Beijing\u2019s clampdown and a business community still seeking market access.\u201d",
          "summary": "The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Chinese officials over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong.\n\u201cIn the face of Beijing\u2019s decisions over the past year that have stifled the democratic aspirations of people in Hong Kong, we are taking action.\nHong Kong officials previously called those US sanctions \u201chostile acts of hegemony\u201d.\nEarlier on Friday, Xia Baolong, the director of China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was quoted by Hong Kong Free Press as saying that sanctions will \u201conly evoke our anger\u201d.\nThe Hong Kong-based news publication quoted former US Consul General in Hong Kong Richard Boucher as saying: \u201cEvery time there\u2019s some news of China putting more pressure on Hong Kong, there\u2019s commensurate pressure on the US side to do something.",

          "text": "Rescue crew have been racing to find survivors of floods that have wreaked havoc across western Europe, killing more than 150 people.\n\nHundreds are still missing after record rainfall triggered severe floods in Germany and Belgium.\n\nHeavy rains also hit Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 where PM Mark Rutte has declared a national disaster in one southern province.\n\nEuropean leaders have blamed the extreme weather on climate change.\n\nExperts say global warming makes torrential rainfall more likely.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began.\n\nIn Germany, where the death toll stands at over 100, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he was \u201cstunned\u201d by the devastation ahead of a visit to a flood-hit region on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhole places are scarred by the disaster,\u201d Mr Steinmeier said at a news conference. \u201cMany people have lost what they have built all their lives.\u201d\n\nRescue teams in Germany were hampered by difficult conditions on Friday, leaving relatives of the missing waiting anxiously for news.\n\nPhone networks were down, roads were badly damaged, and more than 100,000 homes were without power.\n\nThe states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland have been the worst affected by the rainfall.\n\nIn Rhineland-Palatinate\u2019s district of Ahrweiler, officials had said about 1,300 people were missing on Friday \u2013 but added that the figure was \u201cdecreasing every hour\u201d.\n\nA resident of the Ahrweiler village of Schuld told AFP news agency that cars had been washed away and houses knocked down in scenes he likened to a \u201cwar zone\u201d.\n\nRoger Lewentz, the interior minister for Rhineland-Palatinate, told local media the death toll would probably rise. \u201cWhen you haven\u2019t heard from people for such a long time\u2026 you have to fear the worst,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists have been predicting for years that summer rainfall and heatwaves would become more intense due to human-induced climate change.\n\nHannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThe deaths and destruction across Europe as a result of flooding is a tragedy that should have been avoided.\n\n\u201cThe fact that other parts of the northern hemisphere are currently suffering record-breaking heatwaves and fires should serve as a reminder of just how much more dangerous our weather could become in an ever-warmer world.\u201d\n\nScientists say governments must both cut the CO2 emissions that are fuelling extreme events, AND prepare for more extreme weather.\n\nYet in the UK \u2013 hit by severe flooding on Monday \u2013 the government\u2019s advisory climate change committee recently told ministers the nation was even worse prepared for extreme weather than it was five years ago.\n\nAnd only this week the UK government told people that they don\u2019t need to reduce flying because technology will solve the emissions problem \u2013 a notion that most experts consider a gamble.\n\nIn Belgium, the army has been sent to four of the country\u2019s 10 provinces to help with rescue and evacuations. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning.\n\nHe said the floods \u2013 which have claimed at least 20 lives in Belgium \u2013 could be \u201cthe most catastrophic our country has ever seen\u201d.\n\nRescue workers from France, Italy and Austria were sent to the city of Liege, where residents were evacuated after flash floods.\n\nMeanwhile in the Netherlands, thousands of people fled their homes in Limburg province as rising waters swamped cities and broke through a dyke.\n\nBut waters were receding in the southern city of Maastricht and nearby towns, where residents were able to return to their homes on Friday.\n\nIn Switzerland, lakes and rivers were also swelling after heavy rainfall. The river running through the Swiss capital Bern burst its banks on Friday.\n\nLake Lucerne is flooding into the town and people in Basel have been told to keep well away from the River Rhine.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said that social media companies are \u201ckilling people\u201d by failing to police misinformation on their platforms about Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments came a day after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared misinformation about the vaccines a threat to public health and as US officials advised that deaths and serious illness from the virus are almost entirely preventable because of the vaccines.\n\nBiden, asked if he had a message for platforms like Facebook where false or misleading information about the coronavirus vaccines has spread, told reporters on Friday: \u201cThey\u2019re killing people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Murthy said misinformation about COVID-19, deemed an \u201cinfodemic\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO), was deadly.\n\n\u201cMisinformation poses an imminent and insidious threat to our nation\u2019s health,\u201d Murthy said during remarks on Thursday at the White House. \u201cWe must confront misinformation as a nation. Lives are depending on it.\u201d\n\nGiven the role the internet plays in spreading health misinformation, Murthy said technology companies and social media platforms must make meaningful changes to their products and software to reduce the spread of false information while increasing access to authoritative, fact-based sources.\n\nToo often, he said, the platforms are built in ways that encourage, not counter, the spread of misinformation.\n\n\u201cWe are asking them to step up,\u201d Murthy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait longer for them to take aggressive action.\u201d\n\nFacebook spokesperson Dani Lever responded: \u201cWe will not be distracted by accusations which aren\u2019t supported by the facts. The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about Covid-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine. The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.\u201d\n\nTwitter posted on its platform, \u201cAs the Covi-19 pandemic evolves around the world, we\u2019ll continue to do our part to elevate authoritative health information.\u201d\n\nThe Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant strain worldwide, accompanied by a surge of deaths around the United States almost entirely among unvaccinated people, US officials said on Friday.\n\nAmerican cases of COVID-19 are up 70 percent over the previous week and deaths are up 26 percent, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates.\n\nEarlier on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also criticised Facebook.\n\n\u201cObviously, there are steps they have taken. They\u2019re a private-sector company,\u201d Psaki told a White House briefing. \u201cThere are additional steps they can take. It\u2019s clear that there are more that can be taken.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she said the Biden administration was in regular contact with Facebook and was flagging problematic posts.\n\nPsaki said 12 people were responsible for almost 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. The finding was reported in May by the Washington- and London-based nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate but Facebook has disputed the methodology.",
