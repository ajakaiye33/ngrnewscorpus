          "text": "By Steve Oko\n\nThe All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, has lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP-led administation in Abia State over the de-accreditation of Abia State Polytechnic, Aba, by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\nAPGA also expressed displeasure that under the PDP-led administation of Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia State University Uturu, ABSU, has lost accreditation to admit medical students.\n\nSimilarly, the Abia League of Professionals Initiative, ALPI, has also criticised the PDP Government for \u201cwatching the collapse of the education sector in the state\u201d.\n\nThe league of professionals in a statement by its Director-General, Sonny Iroche, said the development \u201cis a strong indictment on the Abia State Government and the officials of government in charge of running the Education sector\u201d\n\nAPGA Chairman in the state, Rev. Augustine Ehiemere, in a statement, said it was heartbreaking that the two tertiary institutions built and effectively managed by previous administations were collapsing under the watch of PDP-led Government.\n\nHe said that posterity would not forgive PDP for ruining the critical education sector where Abia had excelled in the past.\n\nThe statement read in part:\u201dIt is necessary to recall that these institutions which preceded the advent of the PDP misrule in Abia State have been hitherto run effectively and efficiently by preceding governments.\n\n\u201cAt the last count the Abia State Polytechnic staffs are being owed up to 29 months which is more than two years in salaries and allowances.\n\n\u201cThis is in exception of a total teaching and learning infrastructure collapse in these two institutions that the PDP administration met as centers of excellence.\n\n\u201cThese developments become even more intriguing to human understanding when weighed against the fact that even PDP governments in other states of the federation that took office at that same time or even later than the PDP government in Abia have initiated and completed gigantic multi billion naira state institutions in their various states.\n\n\u201cOur neighboring Ebonyi State has initiated and completed one of the best medical schools in Nigeria while Akwa Ibom State has built and partnered with multinational business conglomerates to float major industries including a car assembly plant to cater for the needs of their people and reward their trust.\u201d\n\nAPGA said that \u201cthe essence of government is to guarantee the good of the people by the provision of the basic necessities of life like security, education, good roads, housing, electricity and portable water.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it does appear that under the PDP government of Abia State, the above expectations have been redefined to looting of the peoples common wealth those who have access to power.\u201d\n\nAPGA argued that PDP \u201cshould have at least maintained the institutions it inherited since it cannot improve or create any, instead of superintending over their failure and collapse\u201d.\n\nThe statement condemned what it called \u201cfinancial brigandage by the PDP government in Abia State which has resulted in this continuous tale of woes.\u201d\n\nIt further read:\u201dAPGA finds it hard to understand why a polytechnic and university which are being run successfully and seamlessly by Abia sons like Prof. Gregory Ibe, who do not command the vast resources available to the state, continues to collapse in the hands of a government that pledged to deliver on the trust and expectation of the Abia people.\n\n\u201cAbia people have taken enough punishment from the PDP government of Abia State. The failure of these two schools is the last straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. APGA is calling on the PDP governor of Abia State to show some decency by resigning honorably and apologising to Abia for the misrule and directionlessness his government has foisted on the people.\u2019\n\nAPGA, therefore, urged Abians to vote out PDP in 2023, and support the efforts to rescue and rebuild the state.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Abia masses to take advantage of the 2023 elections and ensure that Abia State is rescued from the strangle hold ot the PDP by voting in an APGA government. We are poised to restore Abia State to the path of hope and glory.\n\n\u201cThe magic flame of APGA which has placed Anambra State among the fastest developing states during the Peter Obi administration and presently being replicated by the Prof. Soludo administration is set to light up the shores of Abia State through an APGA administration.\u201d\n\nThe league of professionals said \u201cIt is a big embarrassment that Abia State, hitherto a bastion of quality education in the past, has degenerated to this level of anomie, by the loss of accreditation of both the Polythecnic and the ABSU Medical College\u201d, ALPI said.\n\nIt called for forensic audit of the account of Abia polytechnic and the probe of the management.",

          "text": "Constitutional lawyer Jiti Ogunye has warned religious leaders it is unlawful to engage in political campaign based on religion or tribe.\n\nSpecifically, he condemned a Christian cleric who threatened his congregation with hell if they fail to vote in \u201cthe favour of the Church\u201d.\n\nIn Ogunye\u2019s view, the cleric\u2019s comment violated the Electoral Act, 2022 and was thus, \u201ca criminal offence.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s comment on his Facebook page was directed at a trending video of Bishop David Abioye, the First Vice President of the Living Faith Church Worldwide.\n\nAbioye is the Senior Pastor of the Abuja church, Living Faith Church, Goshen City with over 30,000 worshippers.\n\nIn the video, Abioye advised Christians to only vote in favour of the church or risk eternal damnation.\n\nOgunye responded in a post titled \u201cCOURTING ELECTORAL CRIME IN THE NAME OF GOD\u201d.\n\nThe lawyer, quoted portions of Abioye\u2019s remarks in the video, wherein he said:\u201cThis is a clear instruction, when it is time to vote vote only in the favour of the Church not for your party. Any believer that sells out his faith in the name of party is heading for hell\u201d.\n\nCondemning the cleric, the activist-lawyer showed by way of the law, why Abioye was wrong.\n\nOgunye said: \u201cThe above quoted statement is contained in a video being circulated in the cyberspace. It was made allegedly by a high ranking pastor, a man of God, of one of the Pentecostal Churches in Nigeria, \u201cregarding the forthcoming 2023 Elections.\n\n\u201cThis statement, when appropriately situated and contextualised, is a violation of the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022. Making such a statement to a congregation and members of a church denomination amounts, in our view, to committing a criminal offence.\n\n\u201cThis statement is not protected by Section 39( 1&2) of the Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom of expression and the press. Verbal or written threats to life or defamatory statements, for example, do not enjoy the constitutional protection of right to freedom of expression and the press.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, Section 97 of the Electoral Act, 2022 prohibits political campaign based on religion or tribe. It states :\n\n\u201c97(1) A candidate, person or association who engages in campaigning or broadcasting based on religious, tribal or sectional reason for the purpose of promoting or opposing a particular political party or the election of a particular candidate, commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction-\n\n\u201c(a) to a maximum fine of # 1,000,000 or imprisonment for a term of twelve months or both; and\n\n\u201c(b) in the case of political party to a maximum fine of # 10,000,000 \u201c.\n\nHe reasoned that perhaps religious leaders should seek for legal permission to join partisan politics.\n\nOgunye added: \u201cAt this rate , it may well be in the interests of partisan politicians in cassocks and in bisht and turbans to ask for constitutional and electoral reforms that will allow for the transformation of religious organizations into political parties.\n\n\u201cIn Egypt, we had the Muslims Brotherhood. In the Netherlands, the Christian Union (Party ); and in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union ( Party), and Christian Social Union ( Party ).The\n\n\u201c Christian Parties \u201c do not campaign for votes on the basis of Christianity, and purely as religious organizations, but the name \u201cChristian\u201d is permitted to be used in these countries\u2019 electoral system.\n\n\u201cEnough of men of God lusting for temporal power of men. To satisfy their lust, they should drop their religious garbs and grab the partisan and political gowns.\n\n\u201cWe are familiar with liberation theology. What is now prevalent in our religious organizations is none of that. It is the apotheosis of politicking theology.\u201d",

          "text": "While electricity is seen as a major booster of industrial growth, the country\u2019s development aspiration has continually suffered severe constraints because of low power generation. During the week, the country\u2019s epileptic electricity grid, collapsed, causing a blackout and leaving businesses and homes with losses. It became a subject of discussion on social media.\n\nSome even made a mockery of the situation saying \u201cNational grid ti lu le.\u201d Major cities including the Federal Capital Territory were cast in darkness.\n\nThe embarrassing development is coming at a time of spike in the cost of diesel and scarcity of petrol, fuel hike to further compound the woes of all Nigerians.\n\nOver the years, successive governments have promised but failed to turn around the country\u2019s power sector which, on average, produces about 4,000 megawatts for a population of 200 million.\n\nThe national electricity grid is a network of generation companies, distribution companies, and the Transmission Company of Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria is solely responsible for the transmission of electricity generated by the generating company to the distribution companies.\n\nAvailable data indicate that there are 23 power generating plants with 11,165 megawatts capacity connected to the national grid. These are managed by generation companies (Gencos), independent power producers, and the Niger Delta Holding Company with only two of these being hydro plants, namely the Jebba and Shiroro plants.\n\nWhile the country\u2019s electricity challenges have remained the same way, some argue that it has worsened further despite the different periodic leadership changes.\n\nThe power grid collapsed twice in March and twice again in April this year. The latest collapse made it the sixth time this year. The grid experienced 206 collapses between 2010 and 2019.\n\nWhile the problem of power has continued to pose a serious issue, the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu appears to be overwhelmed, and cannot find a headway with the intractable power crisis.\n\nEveryone recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari had come to power on the promise that he would tackle the perennial poor power crisis. He had merged the Power sector with Works and Housing and handed the responsibilities to Minister Babatunde Fashola. The expectations were higher.\n\nBut Fashola got overwhelmed and overburdened with the two critical ministries, especially with the torrential responsibilities attached to the offices. Fashola\u2019s successor, Engr. Sale Mamman was appointed to take over the power ministry but along the line, he got sacked and was replaced with Aliyu.\n\nAliyu is the third minister to occupy the power ministry so far in President Buhari\u2019s six years in office. Upon his arrival, Aliyu met the existing issues and was forced to compare the present power supply crisis in the country to a war situation, saying that the ministry under his leadership is taking all necessary measures to remain on top of it. Aliyu, 56, is a civil and water resource engineer. He was until his appointment as substantive minister, the Minister of State for Works and Housing, from 2019 to 2021.\n\nA fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) and a member of the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), he hails from Potiskum in Yobe State.\n\nHe was a former deputy governor under ex-Governor Ibrahim Gaidam who also oversaw the ministries for health, commerce, and integrated rural development as commissioner.\n\nHe attended Central Primary School, Jimeta, Adamawa State, graduating in 1979, and G.S.S.S. Monguno, in Borno State for his West African School Certificate in 1984.",

The majority of those Kidnapped were women and children\n\nAlthough 50 people were initially abducted, 20 (all men) escaped midway into the journey while and 22 others made up of women and children were taking away by their captors but got stranded at the river bank because they could not cross.\n\nHowever, men of the special hunters that were stationed at Galkogo in Shiroro local government area, assisted by the local vigilantes from Sarkin Pawa, all 100 in number swung into action and went after the bandits.\n\nAccording to a source close to Kuchi community, the special hunters divided themselves into two groups with one group attacking the bandits from Galkogo end while another group comprising mainly the local vigilantes invaded the bush from Sarkin Pawa end.\n\nThis Strategies adopted by the special hunters is to avoid being ambushed by the gunmen, and this paid off as the gunmen were said to have taken to their hills when they got wind that they were being trailed from different direction by the security people, abandoning their victims.\n\nIt was gathered that luck however ran out of them when they ran towards the direction of one of the group of special hunters from Galkogo end and were engaged in a fierce gun battle which last about two hours.\n\nScores of the gunmen were neutralized while no casualty was recorded on the part of the special hunters.

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nPresidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 elections, Atiku Abubakar has spoken extensively on the presidential aspirations of the presidential candidate of the All progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu as well as that of the Labour Party\u2019s presidential flag-bearer, Peter Obi.\n\nHe also assured that the PDP National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu will step down if he (Atiku) wins the presidential election next year.\n\nIn an interview on Arise TV on Friday, the former Vice President said: \u201cIf the elected president is from the north and the party chairman happens to be from the north, automatically, the party chairmanship should revert to the south. If I am elected the president, automatically, Ayu will step down. There is also a general misunderstanding because PDP is different from APC. In the PDP administration, the south has had the highest number of years when the PDP was in office, so we need to separate these two so that we can be rational in our argument,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former VP said that during his campaign in 2007, his \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, was because he (Tinubu) wanted to be his running mate and he refused because he didn\u2019t want a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket\n\n\u201cRemember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed CAN. Tinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed and because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yar\u2019Adua. That was the parting point.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership. We are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also revealed that Obi who was his running mate in the 2019 election didn\u2019t inform him of his intention to declare for president and only did so three days after his (Obi\u2019s) declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to expect a miracle to happen, simply because Peter Obi is in the Labour Party. After all, they were saying through social media that they had more than one million votes in Osun State. But how many votes turned out for the Labour Party? And then again, mark you, you\u2019re talking about social media. In the north, 90 per cent of our people are not tuned to social media,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nAtiku said he picked the governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa over the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike because he believes the former can \u2018deliver\u2019.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t reject Wike, I picked who can deliver. Going by history, I had picked an Igbo as running mate in 2007, in 2019. I still picked an Igbo for 2023. The committee that was set up at my own instance deliberated. There was no vote, and they recommended three names, because they knew it was my prerogative to pick anyone of the three. So, there was actually no vote. It\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew there was no vote taken, and I have the report of that committee. The committee recommended three people and I picked one. I did not go out of that recommendation. So, I think people should be fair to me and should also state the fact,\u201d he added.\n\nAtiku however said that he was reaching out to Governor Wike and that the party stakeholders will soon reconcile with the aggrieved Rivers state governor.\n\nWhen asked what the chances of former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi who is now the presidential candidate of the Labour Party is, Atiku said Obi would be unable to win the election even in the South East because the party has no structure.\n\nOn his relationship with former Presidential Olusegun Obasanjo, he said he has been talking to the former president and that the only thing he has yet to do was to visit him after his emergence as the PDP presidential candidate.\n\nWhen asked if he needs Obasanjo\u2019s support, Atiku said: \u201cWhy will I not need his support? He was my former boss. Why will I not need his support? Of course I will need his support. I assume I have it.\u201d",

          "title": "Mike Awoyinfa at 70: Journalism, Ghana, music, sports and me",
          "text": "By Chika Abanobi\n\nToday is July 23. On this day, in 1952, Mike Awoyinfa, Nigeria\u2019s ace writer, human angle journalism exponent and pioneer Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief, The Sun Publishing Limited, was born into the world. That is to say, the pioneer editor of the defunct Weekend Concord is 70 years old today. But if white hair or beard is something that can be used to signpost who is 70, forgive him, he does not sport any. At 70, his prayer is that the Lord will keep him long enough to clock 80, 90, and even 100 until, in his words, he exhausts his brain in writing. A widely-travelled man, the prose stylist and famous biographer has traversed virtually all the continents. Referring to an incident in Paris, France in which he had a nasty fall some years ago, he said: \u201cMy life is always a story for my readers even if I have to make a mockery of myself. I don\u2019t mind making myself a laughing stock for my readers to enjoy.\u201d That, exactly, is what he did in this riveting interview with Saturday Sun, while going down the memory lane. Though a slice of his 70 years on earth having to do with mainly his days in Ghana, and partly in Nigeria, it reads like one of those biographies he and his late bosom friend, Dimgba Igwe, could write. This is Mike Awoyinfa\u2019s story.\n\nHow does it feel turning 70, in terms of aspirations and achievements?\n\nWe have to start by thanking Jehovah, God Almighty, the Father of Heavens and Earth, the One who created us. When we were children, 70 years was associated with bearded men like Moses and Abraham and other biblical characters. It sounded a very distant thing, you know. But we thank God that He has brought me thus far. They say that 70 is the Biblical age. I pray to God that it will not be the limit because there\u2019s so much to do in terms of my profession as a journalist and as a writer, as a biographer. There is so much for me to write. Writing is what keeps my alive. It keeps my mind alive; it\u2019s like a form of exercise. My prayer every morning is, \u2018God, forgive me all my sins, all my iniquities and let me live long enough to do your will and to do all my writings, to write as many books as possible before I finally die in my 90s or 100.\u2019 I want it to be that by the time they bury me, there would have been be nothing left in my brain. I would have exhausted my brain so much so that when I meet my friend, Dimgba, one day in heaven, there will be nothing left.\n\nBut it is said that age is in the mind. Do you feel old?\n\nOld age has its own challenges. Shortly before I became 70, sometimes last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. These are things you don\u2019t think will ever come to you. You think it is somebody else\u2019s sickness. You don\u2019t think you will ever be a victim. But that is reality for you. I am very, very health-conscious. I go for regular checkups. It is by the grace of God that the doctor discovered this thing very early before it begins to metastasise. I have survived it. Doctors said I am a cancer-survivor. I did radiology for 45 days. Radiology or chemotherapy has its own challenges too. It takes both the good and the bad. Here am I. Me that used to be an exercise freak, me that wakes up every morning jogging. Now I cannot even jog again. That\u2019s one of my regrets.\n\nI was going to ask you that question, whether at 70 you still jog\u2026\n\nAt 70, I cannot jog anymore. Apart from that, there is this lumbago at my lower back, degenerating bones. You go to see a doctor and they tell you there is no cure. You have to manage it. That\u2019s the challenge, the annoying thing about old age. Very annoying indeed\n\nAll the same, one must be grateful to God to be alive\u2026.\n\nI am grateful to God. When I look back and see people that were not even up to 40, 50, 60, 70 dying, I have to be grateful to Him that I am alive to see my children and my children\u2019s children. I have about four grandchildren. And they give me a whole lot of joy.\n\nYou were born in Ghana. How long did you stay there before you came down to Nigeria?\n\nMy father migrated to Ghana because he was having children at home, and they were dying.\n\nSo, in essence, you are not his first child?\n\nNo, I am not the first child. I have two sisters ahead of me. That was after my parents relocated to Ghana\n\nWere your parents traders or what?\n\nOf course, they were traders or entrepreneurs because they were quite enterprising. It was when they got there that they had my two senior sisters. Then after that I came, and then my younger brother. So, we are four: two girls and two boys. It was fun growing up though my elder sisters were in Nigeria. I never met them until Ghana sent us packing. Ghanaians said Nigerians must go. They sent two of them to Nigeria, my two elder sisters, to be trained by their relations. The one I am following is the one that tells me about my childhood. He said whenever she sees my son, Jide\u2019s daughter it reminds her of my childhood. He said that\u2019s the way I used to bubble. We give God the glory.\n\nTell us about your reading habit. When and how did it start?\n\nI read a lot when I was a kid because my father made a strategic decision by sending me to stay with the son of his senior sister. He was living with him in Ghana and he trained him up to the advanced teachers\u2019 education level. So, when he became a teacher, he took me under his tutelage. So I became his boy. I was the one preparing his food. It was a childhood of solitude. I feared him.\n\nHe must have been a disciplinarian\u2026\n\nHe was to me. In fact, as he was preparing for his O\u2019 and A\u2019 levels, he was also waking me up. We would be reading together. I would be angry and feeling sleepy. But he would give me a dirty slap. I was good in the arts but not in mathematics. It did not add up. So I read all his books: Peter Abraham\u2019s Tell Freedom, Mine Boy. I mean, all those books on the African Writers Series. I read them. That\u2019s how I became addicted to reading. And every morning he would ask me to buy newspapers: The Ghanaian Times and Weekly Spectator. Before he read them, I would have read them. From there, I knew I was going to be a journalist. Reading helps a lot. It affects your mind. It expands your horizon and makes you creative. You want to write like the people whose books you read. I was doing well in essays. I loved English Literature at school such that if I wrote an essay, whatever essay they gave me, I must steer the topic to whatever I had read. The teacher or school inspector would ask me to come and read my essay to the whole class. That kind of thing is motivational for every kid. Being the \u2018son\u2019 of a teacher, you have to do well. I had my O\u2019 level in Ghana. I was doing very well even in the Ghanaian language. If I write essay here in Ghanaian language, you will be surprised.\n\nWhich of them? Akan?\n\nNo. Fante. I was winning prizes.\n\nDo you still speak it?\n\nOf course, I do! When Ghanaians came to Nigeria, I was speaking it to them.\n\nWhich of their schools did you attend?\n\nInitially, I went to Sekondi College. I passed the Common Entrance when I was in Form 2. It was very early for me, and I had scholarship. But there is what they call \u2018The Monsoon\u2019. It is a term used to describe a situation in which the whole class could be sacked or sent packing if they feel they are not doing well or underperforming educationally. And, they needed the very best. We had Form 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D. They may have to sack students in Form 3D and some of them in Form 3C, and ask you to go and look for another school because you are not good for the school.\n\nHow does the system operate?\n\nThey would weed away some students they feel were not doing well academically as they had expected. They were so strict in that school that, in their quest for excellence, they had to cut away about two classes. That\u2019s how I was affected. The name, \u201cThe Monsoon\u201d, is just a slang word. They wanted just the best. And to them, it is either you are in Form 3A or Form 3B, then part of C. So I went to secondary school too early. Every year, there was massive expulsion of pupils who didn\u2019t do well academically.\n\nIt was like a selection of the very best?\n\nYes, but it affected me. It was based on age and academic performance. I went to secondary school very early in life.\n\nSo, after they sacked you, what happened next?\n\nI had to go and look for another school. I then went to Kwame Nkrumah Secondary School, Nsei-Axim. So that was a turning point in my life. I said, it will never happen to me again. You can be painting your story, and said it was a success all the way, that you had been a whizz kid. I was never a whizz kid. I had my failures when I was in Form 3 or so. I love Sekondi College so much that when I saw the result I got sad.\n\nWhat memories do you have of your parents, your father and mother?\n\nMy mother was such a very sweet woman. She was a daughter of an Imam. So I grew up as both a Muslim and a Christian. According to what I was told, when my father came to marry my mother, my mother said no. My father kept on persisting for three years. He was after this woman. My mother was still saying no. So, eventually my father\u2019s people found a wife for him. But when my mother heard that the man that had been tormenting him was about getting married, suddenly she agreed. So, that\u2019s how my father married two women at a go in his life. So, he went to Ghana with two wives. And those wives were very, very intimate. It was such that I could eat here or there. The second woman had only one daughter who was one year ahead of me. She is still in Ibadan. My mother had four.\n\nWhen you said your father relocated to Ghana because his children were dying, did it also affect the other wife?\n\nYes, both wives\u2019 children were dying. They had a dispute on who among them should be called the first wife. My father said no, my mother is the first because she is a woman he had been chasing for almost four years. So, he made my mother the senior wife. So, I grew up under two mothers. And I was educated both in the Muslim and Christian ways. I went to both the Quranic and Western schools. My experience is that studying at Quranic school comes with a lot of beatings: you memorise and memorise until you get tired. It was a great experience learning from the two religions.\n\nSo your dad allowed that?\n\nMy father was a very tolerant man. He wasn\u2019t difficult. He allowed you to practise your faith. He didn\u2019t disturb anybody. When the Muslims were celebrating, we joined my mother to celebrate. When Christians were celebrating, my mother would go to church. She was such a beautiful and quiet woman. She is the one whose character I have. I resemble my father. It was my sisters that took after my father character-wise, because he was a no-nonsense man. A tall man like that.\n\nTalking about your mother\u2019s children, how many of them are alive today?\n\nMy senior sister died last year at 77. The next to her is alive. But right now, she is in the UK. She is the one I am following. And I have a junior brother who is in Lagos.\n\nWhat does he do?\n\nHe is a commercial driver\n\nWhat do you think was responsible for the death of your parents\u2019 children at the time? Was it an African phenomenon?\n\nI don\u2019t know. People believe that it is witches that are responsible for that. But miraculously when one moves from there to another place, he doesn\u2019t have that kind of experience. Ghana was such a lovely place. We grew up under Kwame Nkrumah\u2019s Convention People\u2019s Party. He was an Africanist. He created Ghana\u2019s Young Pioneers. It was like the Boys\u2019 Scouts. I was a member of the Pioneers. It was more like all these Soviet and Chinese kinds of ideological movements.\n\nYou know, Nkrumah was widely regarded as a socialist\u2026\n\nYes, he was. That\u2019s why they eventually removed him through a coup de tat.\n\nWhat memories do you have of Ghana in those days?\n\nThere were always conflicts between Ghana and Nigeria. That rivalry has always been there from the beginning. Even at school, they would be tormenting you. They would say: \u2018look at you, tribal marks,\u2019 though I was not sporting any. There\u2019s a song they used to sing that \u2018the tiger is coming o, you better go and hide.\u2019 They used to mock or taunt us with it. And, when it comes to football, Ghana\u2019s Black Stars must defeat Nigeria. And anytime they did, we were in trouble in our school. It came to a point that I began to wish that I was a Ghanaian because of their taunting after those soccer tournaments.\n\nWas it where you developed your love for soccer?\n\nYes, I can say so. To Ghanaians, soccer was like a religion. They were like Africa\u2019s Brazil. That was the way they saw themselves. They had many soccer legends. And every time they were playing soccer, we stuck to our radio sets because there was no television by then. Ghana was always beating Nigeria. But on the side of Nigeria, there was Thunder Balogun. That was the kind of environment in which I grew up.\n\nEventually, Ghana asked you people to go\u2026.\n\nYes, it was one of the saddest moments of my life. But I didn\u2019t know it was going to be a blessing to me. After my O\u2019 levels, I came to Nigeria to do my A levels at Ijebu Ijesha Grammar School. There I was appointed the Library Prefect. I think I had the best results in the A\u2019 levels. When I came to Nigeria, there were books. But there weren\u2019t many books in Ghana. It was like a world of books, like a kid in a toy shop. I read and read and read. My friends in Ghana would ask me to send books to them. And I would buy books and send to them. I did it on one or two occasions. I was into sports at Ijebu Ijesha Grammar School. Those were the things I learnt from Ghana. I was into Hurdles. I was doing 100 metres. That was where I met my wife. I never knew she was going to be my wife because I was not even talking to her. It was after our schooldays that we got married. We had graduated, and I was looking for a wife. My people were pressurizing me. We were closing from church, and I just saw her. I said: \u2018How are you? Are you married?\u2019 She said: \u2018not yet.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oya, come, I will marry you.\u2019 Like a play, I took her to meet my parents. They were very happy to see her. My father carried wine to her parents, and that\u2019s how we began our marital journey.\n\nWho gave you your name, Mike?\n\nIt was my father that gave me the Christian name.\n\nSince you were at one time a Muslim, so to say, do you have a Muslim name?\n\nYes. Tiamiyu. In fact, every of my mother\u2019s children had a Muslim name. As a child, it was a Muslim name they used to call me. Nobody was calling me Mike. And they used to call my mum, \u2018Mama Tiamiyu.\u2019 My brother was Ganiyu. My immediate senior sister, the one I am following was Nimota. I have forgotten the Muslim name they were calling my eldest sister. She wasn\u2019t with us in Ghana. But her husband was the one God used to hone my writing skill because in those days we used to exchange letters. He would write with a literary flourish. For me to reply, I would have to do my own research. Every expression I had I would be keeping it for him so that when I wanted to reply to his letter, I would use those expressions. He was one of the reasons I went into journalism because he was working in Radio Nigeria and then as an engineer. But occasionally, he did the editorial side too. He was a contemporary of Biodun Shobanjo, the advert guru.\n\nYou studied Mass Communication at the University of Lagos but majored in broadcasting instead of print journalism. What was the reason for that?\n\nDid I know what I wanted in those days? What was reigning was the deejay of a thing, and I wanted very much to be one. I was a disc jockey on campus. And when I saw that we had a radio station, I said, \u2018ah, let me major in broadcasting so that I can be a deejay.\u2019 So, I learned radio writing, production and all that. The advantage I had was that whenever you are writing for the radio, you write for the ear. You write the way you talk. That has influenced the way I write. I was taught that if there is a bigger word and a smaller word, use the smaller word. So, it has really affected me. I hardly sound bombastic. I try to simplify my expressions, which is very good.\n\nWhat happened after you finished with your studies?\n\nFrom my NYSC which I did in Jos, Plateau State, I applied to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you look for job in a radio or TV station since you majored in broadcasting?\n\nDuring my NYSC I freelanced for a radio station, presenting a programme, but I didn\u2019t find that challenging enough. So I had to teach myself all over again how to write a feature story. I worked for NAN as a correspondent for a year or so. But I had to resign when National Concord came into existence. Before then, I was even getting frustrated with the work at NAN because there was no by-line. No feature story. Nothing! You are just like a civil servant. Initially, I got a job with the Daily Sketch, under Segun Osoba. I didn\u2019t know him then but they gave me the job. Upon getting the job, I went to NAN to tell them that I had been placed on Level 9. They quickly promoted me from Level 8 to 9. But shortly afterwards, Concord came brandishing Dele Giwa, Innocent Oparadike and other big names. I went for the interview in Kaduna. And, they retained me as their Chief Correspondent. While there, I was doing some human angle features and sending them to Dele Giwa on Sunday Concord. He then created a column for me called \u2018Reporter\u2019s Notebook.\u2019 There was a human-angle story on a Hausa journalist, an old woman. I interviewed the woman. It was at Aminu Kano press conference where she was asking questions. I didn\u2019t know that an uneducated woman can be a journalist. She asked the question in Hausa. I did the story, and Dele Giwa entitled the story: \u2018Hajiya \u2026somebody, a reporter without biro and notebook.\u2019 Later on, they brought me down to Lagos. Eventually, Dimgba came to join us. In journalism, you just have to be good. In the writing world, you don\u2019t need a godfather. Your talent is your godfather.\n\nYou lost a friend, Dimgba Igwe. But over the years, nobody has been able to find out the hit-and-run driver that killed him. How does that make you feel?\n\nMy joy is that Dimgba is in heaven. And over there he knows everything. If his killer is found, of what use is that? Will that bring him back again to life?\n\nBut don\u2019t you think it could help to bring a kind of closure to the sordid episode?\n\nWe may have something like that in other developed parts of the world. But we don\u2019t have anything like that here. That\u2019s why crime continues to grow in Nigeria because people can do some things and get away with it. In other places, before someone goes out to commit a crime, he evaluates it. What are the chances of being caught? But here in Nigeria, the chances of being caught are next to nothing. You can get away with murder in this country. You don\u2019t have the facilities to detect crime. No CCTV cameras. Nothing! We are still in the Stone Age in terms of things like that. It is so sad that criminals can brazenly enter prisons to release inmates. These are things that we are not even supposed to find in fiction. They would spend hours waiting for security men to come, and yet nothing would happen. This is a country where criminals would go and waylay a train, kidnap people and demand ransom. I mean, Nigeria has become a land of fiction. You can\u2019t travel by road again. And, the price of airfare is so exorbitant now. That\u2019s not the Nigeria we prayed for. It\u2019s so sad.\n\nHow do you think that Dimgba would have celebrated your 70th birthday if he had been alive today?\n\nAh! He was more of an influencer and organiser! While alive, he organised my 40th, 50th, and 60th birthdays. He would never have agreed that I should be quiet about my birthday. He would have pulled out all the plugs. He would have called out the media and everything. That was one area of his strengths. What he wants is what he wants. And, he wants the best for me.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), has given reasons for its poor performance in last weekend\u2019s governorship election in Osun.\n\nThe party also noted that its defeat has confirmed to Nigerians that the ruling party is not in control of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAPC Deputy National Organising Secretary, Hon Nze Chidi Duru, made the declaration while taking a post-mortem review of the party\u2019s loss in last weekend\u2019s Osun governorship election.\n\nHe further argued that many factors might have contributed to the defeat, noting however that the ruling party did everything legally possible to smile home with the victory at the poll.\n\nHe also quipped that President Muhammadu Buhari congratulating the opposition party was to affirm the ruling party\u2019s liberal mindedness.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe lost the election in Osun State as was proclaimed by INEC and our party has accepted the result. It could be for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the people of Osun wanted a change in government. It could be that they preferred the PDP to be in a position of authority in Osun, but as to what was required by our party to win the election, the party even did more. We energised the base, we mobilise the base, we went out to campaign, all our governors were there few days to the election to hold the closing ceremony and continue to message and explain to the people of Osun what the party represents and what they hope to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe understand and know as a fact that the governor cleared most of the outstanding liabilities in Osun State, but then, ultimately the electorate chose otherwise. We accept our defeat, we are ready and prepared for the next election.\u201d\n\nOn how the internal crack among the stakeholders in the state contributed to the defeat, the Deputy Organising scribe said: \u201cYes, of course, the party had continued to send the signal and the message that we needed to close ranks. We cannot cut our nose to spite our face. Politicians should realise that it is always better to be from inside than from outside.\n\n\u201cWe understand that in the political sphere, what is important is helping the party to win election and being accommodated after the emergence of the party in power in a particular locality. We do not discount the fact that perhaps if we had resolved the apparent division of the stalwarts and stakeholders in Osun State and if perhaps we brought them together, we may have had a different result. But then we don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThere are states where, despite all these, APC had a good showing. If you take Ekiti State for example, there were stalwarts of the party that worked differently, but the party worked very hard and we won the election with a landslide. The scenario again repeated itself in Osun state but we had a different result. We have come to a point, in the party administration, to recognize the fact that there are parties, personalities and stakeholders that for some reason, have chosen not to work together.\n\n\u201cWhat has also become very clear is that this government of APC has no hand and does not impose anything on INEC in the discharge of its responsibility.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we are committed to helping the commission to bequeath to Nigeria the possibility of free, fair and transparent elections. We believe, as a party that it is the only guarantee we need as a country to hold leaders accountable.\n\n\u201cIf the electorate speak as they did in Osun, we will abide by it and if the law court gives an interpretation as to what transpired in Osun, we will also respect the judiciary. These are what is required to build a country,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Buhari, APC Urged to Inaugurate NDDC \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Board to Avert Dire Consequences\n\nEmmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia\n\nConcerned members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Niger Delta area have called for the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari and the national leadership of the ruling party to end the impasse in inaugurating a substantive Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThey warned that the \u201cillegal act\u201d of running the affairs of NDDC with \u201ca contraption of sole administratorship\u201d was already generating adverse political implications for the ruling APC, which appears to be insensitive to the yearnings of the Niger Delta people.\n\nThe group, which described itself as Committed Members of the APC from the Niger Delta Region, sounded the ominous warning in a follow-up letter signed by the trio of Ebihomo Akpoebide, Menegbo Nwinuamene and Itam Edem, which was addressed to both President Buhari and the national leadership of the ruling APC.\n\nAccording to the concerned party members, the prevailing illegality in NDDC \u201cis diminishing the chances of our party, the APC in our region due to our government\u2019s foisting of interim managements and sole administrator contraptions in our region\u2019s foremost agency, NDDC, in violation of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis blatant illegal act of the federal government has been de-marketing APC in the region,\u201d the group said, adding, \u201cas it stands, the APC cannot win an election in the region except the missteps in NDDC are remedied and the NDDC substantive Board is inaugurated in accordance with the law setting up the commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe earnestly urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of our great party, the APC, to act now, end the ongoing illegality of sole administratorship in NDDC, and inaugurate the substantive board of the Commission in compliance with the law, the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nIn a passionate appeal the party members urged the President and the APC national leadership \u201cto hearken to the authentic stakeholders in the Niger Delta states and inaugurate the NDDC Board without further delay.\u201d\n\nSeveral stakeholders and groups in the Niger Delta region have been expressing their dismay and frustration over the \u201cinexplicable delay to inaugurate the substantive Board of the NDDC\u201d despite the unsavoury implications of running the Commission with interim management.\n\nThe concerned APC members lamented that the sole administratorship contraption has been in place for three years now thereby denying the nine constituent states of NDDC the opportunity of fair and equitable representation on the commission\u2019s Board.\n\nThey pointed out that as things stand now, the nine NDDC states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, and Rivers, \u201cwhich by law ought to have representation on the board, have been de\u00adprived of their statutory repre\u00adsentation due to the absence of the Board.\u201d\n\nWithout the Board in place, the group further stated, the constituent states have be\u00aden \u201cdeprived of opportunity of having their representatives who, sitting on NDDC Board, are supposed to ensure that the budget of the NDDC is run in the way that what is due to each state gets to them.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the group said they were encouraged by the new Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Obong Umana Okon Umana, who promised he would strive to \u201cmeet the yearnings of the people of the Niger Delta for development\u201d.\n\nThe minister also assured that \u201ctogether we can create the necessary impact and make the difference for the people of Nigeria and the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nBut the Niger Delta APC members cautioned that the continued administration of the NDDC by Interim management committees/sole administrator would provide the opposition parties with the fodder to roast the APC when electioneering kicks off as the ruling party would have to explain why it has been encouraging illegalities in NDDC.\n\nThe group reminded President Buhari and the APC leadership that they should be concerned about the mood of the Niger Delta people and should not continue to disdainfully overlook their demands for the right things to be done in the running of NDDC.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari needs to end the ongoing illegality in NDDC if APC desires to win the upcoming general elections, across board in the entire region, and be remembered for good in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cWe restate that this is the minimum the federal government and the APC can do to win back the trust of the Niger Delta people and stand a chance to do well in the region, in the forthcoming 2023 general election,\u201d the concerned APC members said.",

          "text": "Wale Igbintade\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 150 Women Rights and Civil Society Organisations have called on the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to immediately lift suspension on the guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indicators.\n\nThe groups maintained that women have rights to their bodily integrity and to life, stressing that the \u2018Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indicators\u2019 is meant to save women from preventable death.\n\nLagos State, through the Directorate of Family Health and Nutrition in the state\u2019s Ministry of Health had on June 29, 2022, presented a 40-page policy document titled \u2018Lagos State Guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indicators\u2019 to set out guidelines for safe termination of pregnancy within the ambit of the Criminal Law of Lagos State.\n\nThe guidelines are meant to standardise and build capacity for medical professionals to save lives of pregnant women whose pregnancy continuation is a danger to their lives and physical health.\n\nHowever few days after, the state government on July 8, 2022 ordered the suspension of the Guidelines.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday in Lagos, the Executive Director, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, alleged that the state government is being blackmailed by religious sentiments, and by persons with certain philosophical convictions to suspend the Guidelines.\n\nDr. Akiyode-Afolabi stated that the document was a painstaking work by experts in Law, in Obstetrics, Gynaecology, adding that the Guideline has created an opportunity to reduce maternal mortality in line with existing laws.\n\nShe warned that failure to lift the suspension may lead the groups to occupy the governor\u2019s office to press home their demands.\n\nAccording to her, Nigeria is obligated to implement 2030 Global Sustainable Development Goals agreed by world governments at the United Nations in September 2015, with a target of universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services.\n\nShe lamented that the current abortion law in Nigeria was instituted by the British \u2018Offences Against Persons Act, Section 58\u2019 in the 19th century, which has not been repealed or amended.\n\nAkiyode-Afolabi explained that the Lagos State Guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indications detailed safe therapeutic abortion methods and defined therapeutic abortion as a termination of a pregnancy, performed when the pregnancy endangers the mother\u2019s life, physical or mental health, or when the fetus has a condition incompatible with normal life.\n\nShe said, \u201cUnsafe Abortion accounts for a high number of maternal deaths in Nigeria. 10 per cent of global maternal death rate comes from unsafe abortions in Nigeria, making it the second leading cause of maternal mortality in the country. This is a neglected major area of preventable maternal deaths due to provisions of Nigerian Abortion Laws.\n\n\u201cNigeria is yet to comprehensively reform restrictive domestic laws and policies that place women and girls\u2019 health and lives at risk and prevent them from exercising their reproductive rights which the Nigerian government has been committed to under international law. In 2017, 212,000 women out of two million annually estimated to have had abortions were treated for complications while 285,000 never received treatments for the severe health consequences they faced.\n\n\u201cNigeria is obligated to implement 2030 Global Sustainable Development Goals agreed by world governments at the United Nations in September 2015, with a target of universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services. The current abortion law in Nigeria was instituted by the British Offences Against Persons Act, Section 58, in the 19th century and has not been repealed or amended.\n\n\u201cA person cannot be arrested for a medical abortion validated by Section 201 of Criminal Law of Lagos State. The new law provides two lawful grounds for which abortion carried out: preservation of a mother\u2019s life and preservation of a woman\u2019s physical health.\n\n\u201cThe denial of safe abortion care to survivors of rape violates the right to health and privacy and may violate the prohibition of ill-treatment. Nigeria is bound by the provisions of Maputo Protocol which is the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. It is the main legal instrument for the protection of the rights of women and girls in Africa.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cArticle 14 of the Maputo Protocol guarantees women\u2019s right to health, including sexual and reproductive health. Under Article 14 (2) (c) of the Maputo Protocol, States Parties are called upon to take all appropriate measures to \u201cprotect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus\u201d.\n\n\u201cSeveral international organisations such as World Health Organisation, International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians, the Amnesty International, United Nations and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have repeatedly issued guidelines to indicate women have a right to decide on whether or not to have an abortion. It is her body, it should be her choice! One of the long term outcomes of the Guidelines is to ensure reproductive choice for women faces with unintended pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe development and dissemination of the policy document showed Lagos leading state-level intervention on unsafe abortion while giving women and girls improved healthcare. It cannot be over-emphasised that the Guidelines need to be passed and not withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on Lagos State Government to immediately lift the suspension on the guidelines, we believe that the state government is being blackmailed by religious sentiments, women have a right to their bodily integrity and to life what the guidelines is pushing for us to save women from a good preventable death. The ban on the Guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indications should immediately be lifted.\u201d",

          "text": "We cannot play possum about it. Unity has remained a reverie, and an elusive expedition for Nigeria. We long for it, but we cannot reach it because we are not willing to work at it. We are not ready to tear down the iron curtains of ethnicity and religion. We are not ready.\n\nIt is a sheer pursuit of a will-o-the-wisp to assume or suggest that any single leader can unite Nigeria without commensurate efforts of citizens to the cause. To unite Nigeria, there is a place for leadership, and there is a place for followership. Uniting Nigeria will involve Nigerians from all strata.\n\nThe place of leadership in achieving unity in Nigeria is the place of personal example. Leadership by deed not just by words. The leadership demonstrating the highest level of objectivity, fairness and probity in dealing with Nigerians regardless of religious or political persuasion or ethnic background. The leadership showing sufficient inoculation against the contagion of religious and ethnic bigotry and exclusivism.\n\nWhere the leadership betrays prejudices, the followership sunders. The leadership is doomed to be assailed by a phalanx of discontents when it ignores the elements of inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe place of leadership in forging bonds of communality is the place of purpose and deliberateness. The leadership must be very deliberate in managing diversity and in fostering kinship among variegated people. Nation building cannot be left to chance or to the whim of anyone. There must be purposive plans and actions towards uniting the people.\n\nThere must be a willful policy and programme \u2013 even if it means setting up an instrument like a Unity Committee or Commission with pragmatic targets \u2013 among other considered options.\n\nThe leadership needs to address the issue of \u2018\u2019ethnic origin and identity?\u2019\u2019 Am I a Nigerian because I am Igbo? Or Am I a Nigerian by virtue of my birth and allegiance to my country? The truth is most \u2018\u2019citizens\u2019\u2019 submit to their ethnic nationalities rather than to Nigeria. They derive their identity not from Nigeria but from their ethnic stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo whom do we owe allegiance \u2013 our tribe or Nigeria? The reality is some of us, if not most, define our existence and identity from a tribal standpoint. We think in tribal amplitude and act in protection of the tribe. Our tribe comes first; we steal, fight and even kill for the tribe. The nation as an entity is split into disparate collections of kinfolks with unrequited loyalty. This is the trouble with Nigeria. The state is perpetually slaughtered for the tribe.\n\nWe need to build a Nigerian identity. All ethnic nationalities must be willing to surrender their individual identities to a Nigerian identity. This does not imply discarding our individual culture, tradition and heritage, but embracing an expansive identity for the survival of our country. Our potpourri of cultures, tongues and tribes makes us a uniquely beautiful country. The divergences, clustered like the magnificent colours of the rainbow, should be our strength and not a source of persistent conflicts.\n\nGiving up the tribe means putting the interest of the nation first; it means acting on the philosophy of the monolithic whole as against group agenda; it means eschewing divisive utterances and actions; it means accenting our strengthens and areas of convergence rather than promoting discord and points of divergence; it means embracing our common identity as Nigerians and consigning the tribal identity to secondary relevance. It means being Nigerian.\n\nCan the presidential hopefuls \u2013 Bola Tinubu of APC; Atiku Abubakar of PDP, and Peter Obi of Labour Party \u2013 unite Nigeria?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think Tinubu has shown by his antecedents, in words and deeds, that he is of the nationalist phylum but with a surfeit of understanding of the imperativeness of building a nation on the back of subnational development, responsibility and self-reliance. He has on different occasions suggested ways Nigeria can better organise itself as a federation and manage its diversity. He once said: \u2018\u2019When we unite and not untie, we build on an existing maxim of ONE NIGERIA by describing that ONENESS as the fabric of a larger society S.E.W.N. (South East West North) together.\u2019\u2019 Tinubu has a robust matrix of associates and supporters across Nigeria\u2019s geopolitical zones. And his approach to national matters has been plural without sectional or religious affectations.\n\nAtiku\u2019s campaign is foregrounded on \u2018\u2019One Nigeria\u201d. The PDP presidential candidate is known to be expansive in outlook, and with a network of associates across Nigeria. Atiku has no history of sectional or religious bias. And he has remained nationalistic in disposition through the years.\n\nBut beyond the personality type and depositions of these candidates, uniting Nigeria will need more than the \u2018\u2019body language\u2019\u2019 of the leadership. It will take deliberate effort, personal example and a clear strategy.\n\nUniting Nigeria is hard labour, but a task that must be done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Nigeria to the UK with the Global Talent Visa",
          "text": "Japa (verb, /d\u0292a pa/, Nigeria): to leave one\u2019s home country in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhen writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In 2020, the UK instituted the Global Talent Visa which allows leaders or potential leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology, to work in the UK for up to 5 years, without a sponsor or a job offer.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Adedeji to TechCabal in an interview. \u201cFrom start to finish, the whole process probably took about 2 months. And from an application perspective, I was most surprised about how effective it was.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 surprise was that a 5-year residence visa existed for writers. \u201cVisas like these are usually reserved for STEM careers or even tech professionals. Writers and poets like me usually focus on fellowships or masters\u2019 degrees,\u201d he commented in a Twitter Space he and Adedeji held earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 own application process, from submission to approval, took a total of 2 weeks, but he\u2019d taken 5 months to plan, and the only major delays he experienced were with his medical tests.\n\nOpe Adedeji, managing editor at Paystack\n\nAdedeji and Jones are just 2 out of many Nigerians who have taken advantage of the Global Talent Visa to leave their home countries to work abroad. In fact, Nigeria ranked third for the total number of applications processed for the visa in 2021 while South Africa ranked 10th.\n\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\n\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional Promise\n\nThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\n\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\n\nPeople who apply under Exceptional Talent are established leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology. They have won prestigious awards, appeared in notable publications, and have many years of experience under their belt.\n\nApplicants under Exceptional Promise have a record of outstanding work in their field over a 5-year period. They are intentional about developing outstanding international track records.\n\nEach of the 6 endorsing bodies has its own requirements for the Exceptional Talent and Exceptional Promise, and you can check them out here.\n\nAdedeji and Jones, both of whom have glowing track records of excellence in writing, applied for the visa under Exceptional Promise for arts and culture, which is open to creatives with careers in literature, dance, architecture, fashion design, film, and animation. The documents they needed were basic: passports, tuberculosis test results, and more importantly, 3 recommendation letters from organisations and people established in their fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been published in quite a number of notable magazines and publications over the years, and I also had a few literary awards to my name. I\u2019d also been a speaker at some literary festivals, so all I had to do was gather these in a document and submit it to the Arts Council,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nChika Jones, poet and digital marketing manager\n\nWhen she first heard of the visa, Adedeji, who is also managing editor at Paystack, had thought endorsement would be the most difficult part of the application process. \u201cI was sceptical at first because I thought I probably didn\u2019t qualify. After reading a bit more and speaking to people who\u2019d already gotten the visa, I realised I had a chance, and I took it.\u201d\n\nAdedeji mentioned that she collated links to her appearances and awards, her published stories, and news mentions in a Google Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took,\u201d she said.\n\nJones concurred, adding that the process is less stressful than people think it is. \u201cVisas are notoriously difficult to get, and so people don\u2019t even try. But with this, it wasn\u2019t as mind-numbing as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe UK Global Talent Visa website states that endorsement takes about 4 weeks, but both writers got their arts and culture endorsements within 2 weeks.\n\nFunfere Koroye, a design engineer whom TechCabal interviewed for an earlier episode of Digital Nomads, applied under Exceptional Talent. His route was a bit different from Adedeji\u2019s and Jones\u2019. While the creators had to apply to the Arts Council England, the endorsing body for arts and culture, Koroye had to apply to Tech Nation, the endorsing body for digital technology.\n\nUnder the digital technology option, people with technical and business skills can apply for endorsement.\n\nThe careers eligible for the digital technology Talent Visa\n\nKoroye already had over 8 years of experience building and designing products, and even building a startup, NuPay Technologies. All he had to do was dust up his resume, gather the links to sites like Figma and GitHub which highlighted his projects, and submit them to Tech Nation. Koroye\u2019s application was so successful he was also invited to become an ambassador for Tech Nation. \u201cMy job as an ambassador is to create more awareness about the visa,\u201d Koroye said. \u201cAcross Africa, not a lot of people know about the visa, so I\u2019m here to spread awareness and give people information about their applications.\u201d\n\nAfter getting endorsed, all the professionals had to do was get their tuberculosis test results, schedule a date for biometric capturing, and submit their applications. Adedeji, who had already been living in the UK for her masters\u2019 at the time, did not have to get a tuberculosis test or buy a ticket.\n\n\u201cMy process took 5 months because it was difficult to get my tuberculosis test, but that was the only stressful part. Everything else was pretty smooth,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAnd the best part\u2026\n\nThe whole process costs about \u00a32,000, said Jones who applied with and moved with his wife.\n\nTotal amount Chika Jones spent applying for the UK Global Talent Visa\n\n\u201cBut it can be more expensive, depending on how many years you apply for, and how you\u2019re moving.\u201d The visa itself costs \u00a3623\u2014\u00a3456 for endorsement and \u00a3167 for the visa application itself. You\u2019ll also have to pay \u00a3624 per year for every year you plan to spend in the UK for up to 5 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, the costs for endorsement, health insurance and biometrics all added up to about \u00a33,500,\u201d said Adedeji.\n\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round. The visa only requires awardees to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every year they have applied for; the rest of the time can be spent in any country of their choosing. \u201cIt just opens you up to a more expansive world,\u201d Koroye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re open to applications from Digital Nomads. If you\u2019re an African who\u2019s travelling the world while working or living abroad for work, please send me an email at timi@bigcabal.com and sultan@bigcabal.com or fill this form.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Netflix loses 970,000 subscribers in Q2",
          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How to navigate delivery apps and traditional logistics companies in Lagos and Kaduna",
          "text": "This week\u2019s Everyday People comes with a little twist. In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Co-founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Co-founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up. I think one month, when I wanted to send a package, they told me it would cost \u20a68,000 ($18).\n\nHow much is the cloth the person bought? With public transport, you pay like \u20a62,000 ($4), and it gets there.",

          "text": "Adoption of technology, religious sentiments, the rise of third forces, increased polictical awarenes and participation among Nigerian youths drive other factors that tense up the political space ahead of general elections in 2023.\n\nAs the race to elect new Nigerian leaders \u2014 president, governors and lawmakers \u2014 in 2023 approaches, a delegation of international election observers from the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI), were in Nigeria from July 13 to 22, 2022.\n\nThe delegation met with representatives from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the National Assembly, political parties, civil society, the media, security forces, academia, and diplomatic missions to assess the current political and electoral environment in the run-up to the general elections in 2023, preparations for the general elections and offer recommendations to boost citizen confidence in the process and mitigate the risk of electoral violence; and demonstrate inter-party cooperation.\n\nFollowing that, the delegates issued a statement outlining their observations.\n\nThe governorship elections in Osun and Ekiti states, according to the statement, demonstrated the positive impact of INEC initiatives implemented since 2019 to improve results transparency, such as the introduction of the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV) and the elimination of voting points.\n\nThe election observers held that the 2023 elections will depart from some of the political dynamics that defined previous elections in the country. For the first time since 2007, there will be no incumbent in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of Peter Obi \u2013 former Anambra state governor and presidential candidate for the Labour Party (LP) \u2013 and Rabiu Kwankwaso \u2013 former Kano governor and presidential candidate for the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) \u2013 as viable \u201cThird Forces\u201d has excited many young Nigerians. If a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nFurthermore, improvements in Electoral Reform, Transparency of Election Results, Electoral Disputes, Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), Promoting Peaceful Elections, and party Primaries are notable among the summation of international election observers\u2019 observations with Nigeria\u2019s political structure, particularly on the part of INEC.\n\n\u201cStakeholders noted to the delegation that the 2022 primaries were more transparent, inclusive, and peaceful than in the past. Despite persistent incidents of vote buying and interference by some governors, the use of ad hoc, as opposed to statutory delegates, reduced the influence of party leadership members on the selection of candidates, leading to more transparency in voting and less violence than in 2018,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the other hand, the delegates surmised intra-party disputes, monetization of politics, insecurity, election violence, electoral offenses,\n\nmisinformation, disinformation, and hate speech, as some of the prevalent shortcomings that must be addressed ahead of the elections.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has deepened, spreading to many parts of the country. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project, Nigeria experienced more incidents of political violence, conflict, and protest in 2021 than in any other year since data collection began in 1997,\u201d the observers said.\n\n\u201cWith a dramatic increase in banditry, kidnapping, and criminality across the country, it is therefore likely that the 2023 elections will take place in an environment that is more insecure than in previous polls.\u201d\n\nHowever, the delegation\u2019s work, which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), produced 24 recommendations for a successful election in 2023.\n\nRead also: Osun, Ekiti elections boost public confidence in INEC \u2013 Report\n\nOn election administration\n\nThe group urged the electoral umpire, INEC to allocate its remaining funds to ensure that it can complete procurement processes, training, and the deployment of necessary personnel and materials.\n\nThe observers implored INEC to implement assistive voting cubicles for people living with disabilities, women, youth and Internally Displaced Persons.\n\n\u201cWith this change, INEC should consider voting cubicle modifications that protect ballot secrecy,\u201d the group said in it\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe government should end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. This is critical for security because young people who are unable to study are more likely to be recruited into cults, gangs, or other groups that contribute to electoral violence.\u201d\n\nConcerning security, the delegates urged INEC and security forces to anticipate and plan for situations in which violence may be used to suppress votes or change outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe government should address formally the role that informal security outfits (such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu) may play in the run-up to and during elections,\u201d the group said.\n\nAccording to the results of the assessment of Nigeria\u2019s electoral environment, if the 2023 elections failed to improve on previous elections, Nigerians may lose faith in the potential and dividends of democracy.\n\nSince the transition from military to civilian democratic rule in 1999, both the NDI and the IRI have sent international election observers to all general elections in Nigeria.\n\nLater this year, NDI and IRI will send a second pre-election assessment delegation, as well as a joint international delegation, to observe the presidential and National Assembly elections in 2023.",

          "text": "A delegation of United States-based National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said on Friday that the 2023 presidential election may go into rerun with the emergence of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and candidate of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso,\n\nAccording to them, the 2023 elections would be a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls in Nigeria.\n\nThe delegation of the NDI/IRI which visited Nigeria from July 13-22 and led by Secretary of State for Ohio, Frank LaRose, stated these while presenting its first joint pre-elections assessment statement to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe institutes, which described Obi and Kwankwaso as a viable \u201cthird forces\u201d, said their emergence as presidential candidates for the 2023 elections has excited many young Nigerians.\n\nThey said that \u201cif a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that the 2023 elections present a significant opportunity to consolidate Nigeria\u2019s democracy, the organisations observed that the 2022 Electoral Act enjoys a wide stakeholder support and has elevated public confidence in the commitment of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deliver democratic elections in 2023.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe 2023 elections are a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls. For the first time since 2007, the presidential election will be an open contest with no incumbent. The ruling All Progressives Congress selected former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, as its flagbearer. Former Vice President and 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will contest on the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cHowever, the emergence of Peter Obi \u2014 former Anambra State governor and presidential candidate for the Labour Party \u2014 and Rabiu Kwankwaso \u2014 former Kano governor and presidential candidate for the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party \u2014 as viable \u201cThird Forces\u201d has excited many young Nigerians. If a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe document also said that the 2022 Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, the first elections held since the electoral law was passed, demonstrated the positive impact of initiatives implemented by INEC since 2019 to improve results\u2019 transparency.\n\nSuch measures included the introduction of the INEC Result Viewing Portal and elimination of voting points, and adoption and proper configuration of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System for voter accreditation, which has quickened the voting process and reduced tensions in polling units.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in voter registration numbers and increased voter turnout in the 2022 Osun polls, especially among young people, point to a renewed interest in political participation among Nigerians. However, there are questions about whether the 2022 Electoral Act will be fully implemented and whether political parties will take advantage of this increased enthusiasm to engage Nigerians on issues that matter to them. There are also questions about whether these new technologies \u2014 IReV and BVAS \u2013 will perform at the same level when scaled up for the national elections\u201d, the organisations said.\n\nThe institutes said, while there had been some positive changes since the 2019 elections, stakeholders with whom its delegation met expressed concern about the direction of the country.\n\nAccording to them, confidence in the government and elections has declined over the past 10 years, \u201cas exemplified by the #EndSARS movement that gained traction in 2020 to protest security forces abuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, insecurity has deepened, spreading to every corner of the country. Extremist and sectarian violence continues to spread, banditry and criminality are endemic, separatist elements are gaining traction, and informal security forces are proliferating.\n\n\u201cThis intensifying violence takes place against the backdrop of increasing religious and regional division permeating the political discourse. If the 2023 polls fail to improve upon past elections, Nigerians may lose faith in the ability of democracy to deliver,\u201d the organisations warned.\n\nThey called on the government to allocate the remaining funding to INEC, saying this would ensure the completion of procurement processes, training, and deployment of necessary staff and materials.\n\nAccording to them, INEC should extend the period for voter registration to capitalise on excitement from the Osun and Ekiti elections and the nomination of final presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThe courts should be allocated sufficient funding to ensure members of Election Tribunals have the necessary resources for training, transportation, and security.\n\n\u201cINEC and security forces should anticipate and plan for areas where violence may be used to suppress votes/change outcomes. The government should formally address the role that informal security outfits (such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu) may play in the lead up to and during elections.\n\n\u201cThe government should resolve the Academic Staff Union of Universities\u2019 strike. This is critical for security, as young people unable to study could be easily recruited into cults, gangs, or other groups that could contribute to electoral violence\u201d, they added.",

          "text": "Olusegun Obasanjo said except for farming, everything he has done and achieved in life was by accident.\n\nObasanjo, who was an ex-military Head of State before he was elected as a civilian President in 1999, stated this on Saturday on a live radio interview with Segun Odegbami on Eagles7 Sports 103.7 FM, Abeokuta.\n\nObasanjo said he was always proud to be addressed as a farmer.\n\nOdegbami had asked Obasanjo to speak about what he termed his \u201cromance with farming.\u201d\n\nIn response, the ex-president said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the word you used, \u2018romance with farming\u2019. I am a farmer. What do you mean by romance? Everything I have done in my life is by accident. The only thing that is not accidental is farming. Every other thing that I\u2019ve been to is by accident. And you called that romance? No! What do you mean by romance?\n\n\u201cYou know my beginning. I was born and bred in a village. I went to school by accident. My father just said, \u2018won\u2019t you do something different?\u2019 So I went into farming.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at countries that have made it, they developed on agriculture. First, for the purpose of food security; second, for the purpose of processing what they get from their farms, which is the beginning of industrialization. Third, to give it out as export, which is for the purpose of foreign exchange; and fourth, as a means of generating employment for the youth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Obasanjo in the interview also dropped advice for Nigerian youths.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy advice for Nigerian youths is that, never let anybody tell you that you are the leaders of tomorrow.

          "title": "BREAKING: UN tells Nigeria to unconditionally release, compensate Nnamdi Kanu",
          "text": "The United Nations, UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has indicted both Nigeria and Kenya Governments for the arrest and extraordinary rendition, torture and continued detention of the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, without due process.\n\nUN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\nIt also recommended that Government officials responsible for the torture meted to the IPOB Leader be investigated and punished.\n\nThe UN body further directed Nigeria to report back within six months of the transmission of its opinions on Kanu\u2019s matter, steps taken to comply with all the recommendations thereof.\n\nIt referred the case of Kanu\u2019s torture to Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration\n\nThe UN Working Group also threatened to take further action to ensure the recommendations are complied with, noting that both Nigeria and Kenya are signatories to the Convention and should comply.\n\nThe 16-page report dated July 20, 2022 was adopted on April 4 by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its 93rd session, held between March 30 \u2013 April 8, 2022.\n\nThe unedited version of the document sighted by Vanguard, was marked:\u201dOpinion No. 25/2022 concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu (Nigeria and Kenya).\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established in resolution 1991/42 of the UN Commission on Human Rights.\n\nIn accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group, on December 30, 2021, transmitted to the Nigeria and Kenya Governments, a communication concerning\n\nMr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria replied to the communication on 25 January 2022 while the Government of Kenya did not reply.\n\nBoth countries are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe Working Group said in the report that Kanu was a victim of State persecution as Nigeria failed to provide convincing explanations with proof that he is guilty of treason and other criminal allegations levelled against him.\n\n\u201cNoting the failure of the Government to explain what actions of Mr. Kanu amounted\n\nto such criminal acts and how, and observing the lack of any evidence that any of his actions may in fact amount to such crimes, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu is in fact being persecuted for the peaceful exercise of his rights, most notably his freedom of opinion and expression.\n\n\u201cIn the present case, the Government of Nigeria has presented no exceptions permitted under article 19 (3) of the Covenant nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Kanu\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression was anything but peaceful.\n\n\u201d In fact, the Government has chosen not to provide any explanation for the arrest, detention and subsequent proceedings against Mr. Kanu. In these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\n\nThe Working Group also said there was no evidence that International laws were observed in the arrest and rendition of Kanu from Kenya.\n\nThe 16-page dossier read in part: \u201cIn the present case, Mr. Kanu was not furnished with an arrest warrant by Nigerian\n\nauthorities nor was he promptly informed of the grounds for his arrest in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, the Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu\u2019s continued deprivation of liberty\n\nviolates his rights under articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article\n\n9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4, and 10 of the Body of Principles and constitutes\n\narbitrary detention under category I.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning to the uncontested allegations that following his rendition to Nigeria,\n\nMr. Kanu remained in pre-trial detention with his trial having been scheduled to commence\n\nin January 2022, the Working Group recalls that it is a well-established norm of international law that pre-trial detention should be the exception rather than the rule, and should be ordered for the shortest time possible. Put differently, liberty is recognised under article 9 (3) of the Covenant as the core consideration with detention merely as an exception.\n\n\u201cTherefore, detention pending trial must be based on an individualised determination that it is reasonable and necessary for such purposes as to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrence of crime. Such determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, in accordance with article 9 (3) of the Covenant, an arrested person is to be\n\nbrought before a judge within 48 hours.27 This was not satisfied in the case of Mr. Kanu and\n\nthe Working Group therefore finds a violation of articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration\n\nof Human Rights, article 9 (3) of the Covenant and principles 11, 37 and 38 of the Body of\n\nPrinciples.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in order to establish that a detention is indeed legal, anyone detained has\n\nthe right to challenge the legality of his or her detention before a court, as guaranteed by\n\narticle 9 (4) of the Covenant. The Working Group wishes to recall that according to the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures on the Rights of Anyone Deprived of their Liberty to Bring Proceedings before a Court, the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court is a self-standing human right, which is essential to preserve legality in a democratic society.\n\n\u201cThis right, which is in fact a peremptory norm of international law, applies to all forms of deprivation of liberty, 29 to \u201call situations of\n\ndeprivation of liberty, including not only to detention for purposes of criminal proceedings but also to situations of detention under administrative and other fields of law, including military detention, security detention, detention under counter-terrorism measures\u201d.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it also applies \u201cirrespective of the place of detention or the legal terminology used in the legislation. Any form of deprivation of liberty on any ground must be subject to\n\neffective oversight and control by the judiciary. This was also denied to Mr. Kanu, thus, violating his right under article 9 (4) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFinally, turning to Mr. Kanu\u2019s pre-trial detention in Nigeria, the Working Group\n\nrecalls that according to international human rights law, in particular article 9 (3) of the\n\nCovenant, any person detained while awaiting trial is entitled to trial within a reasonable\n\ntime, or otherwise shall be released. Article 14 (3) (c) of the Covenant also guarantees the\n\nright of anyone charged with a criminal offence to be tried without undue delay. In the\n\nabsence of a substantive response from the Government of Nigeria, the Working Group finds no legitimate grounds for the delays in the trials against Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Working Group finds that the Government of Nigeria failed to\n\nestablish a legal basis for the detention of Mr. Kanu. His detention is thus arbitrary under\n\ncategory I.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said that both the Nigerian and Kenyan Governments should take responsibility for Kanu\u2019s rights violations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group wishes once again to underscore the collusion between the\n\nGovernments of Kenya and Nigeria in the rendition of Mr. Kanu and reiterates that both\n\nGovernments bear joint responsibility for any violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in Kenya and\n\nNigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group has already established in its discussion of the detention of Mr. Kanu in Kenya that he was arrested and detained due to the peaceful exercise of his rights (see paras 52-54 above). The Working Group notes that the source has argued the same in relation to Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest, detention and trial proceedings in Nigeria. Notably, the\n\nGovernment of Nigeria has chosen not to address the substance of these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group notes that it is not contested that Mr. Kanu is accused of the crime of conspiracy to commit a treasonable felony through an agreement with others to be broadcast from London, in view of the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty. The source notes that, while treason consists of \u201clevying war\u201d against Nigeria under Nigerian law, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not allege any action implicating Mr. Kanu in the contemplation, planning, or incitement of war against Nigeria. The source argues that\n\nMr. Kanu was in fact advocating for a peaceful referendum for the establishment of a Biafran\n\nsovereignty, in conformity with international and other relevant laws.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group recalls that freedom of opinion and expression, as expressed in article 19 of the Covenant, is an indispensable condition for the full development of the person. It is essential for any society and constitutes the foundation stone for every free and democratic society. It also recalls that freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and that this right includes the expression and receipt of communications of every form of idea and opinion capable of transmission to others, including political\n\nopinions.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in Resolution 12/16, the Human Rights Council called on States to refrain\n\nfrom imposing restrictions which are not consistent with article 19 (3), including on the\n\ndiscussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights; engaging in peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group further said that the Nigeria Government could not disprove claims by Kanu that he was denied effective lagal representation including access to his US lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe source has submitted, and the Government did not address, that Mr. Kanu was denied effective legal representation. The Working Group considers legal representation as being a core facet of the right to a fair trial. Legal assistance should be available at all stages of criminal proceedings, namely, pre-trial, trial, and appellate stages, to ensure compliance with fair trial guarantees. Any denial of access to lawyers substantially undermines and compromises an accused individual\u2019s capacity to defend him or herself in any judicial proceedings.\n\n\u201cAs the Working Group has stated in principle 9 and guideline 8 of its Basic Principles,\n\npersons deprived of their liberty have the right to legal assistance by counsel of their choice,\n\nat any time during their detention, including immediately after the moment of apprehension, and must be promptly informed of this right upon apprehension. Access to legal counsel should not be unlawfully or unreasonably restricted.\n\n\u201cArticle 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant entitles defendants to adequate time and facilities\n\nfor the preparation of their defence and to communicate with counsel of their own choosing. Defendants must have access to documents and other evidence, including \u201call materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that could assist the defence.\n\n\u201cRecalling general comment No. 32, a detainee has the right to have \u201cprompt access\u201d to legal counsel, meaning that a lawyer must be able to have private communications and\n\nmeetings with the detainee and be able to attend all the investigations without interference or restrictions. A detainee also ought to have access to \u201ceffective counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this was denied to Mr. Kanu. In the Working Group\u2019s view, by failing to allow\n\nMr. Kanu to be represented by lawyers of his choice, including an international counsel,\n\nthe Government denied Mr. Kanu\u2019s right to legal assistance at all times, which is inherent in the right to liberty and security of the person as well as the right to a fair and public hearing\n\nby a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in accordance with articles 3, 9, 10 and 11 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 14 of the\n\nCovenant, articles 37 (b) and (d) and 40 (2) (b) (ii) and principles 15, 17 and 18 of the Body\n\nof Principles and principles 1, 5, 7, 8, 21 and 22 of the Basic Principles on the Role of\n\nLawyers.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also disturbed by the source\u2019s report of the treatment of\n\nMr. Kanus\u2019s lawyers and recalls its jurisprudence highlighting that such treatment of lawyers is entirely unacceptable and violates articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant.41 It is the legal and positive duty of the State to protect everyone on its territory or under its jurisdiction against any human rights violation and to provide remedy whenever a violation still occurs.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s presumption of innocence was\n\nviolated as the Department surrounded the court complex with an array of armed forces,\n\ncreating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger (see para. 9), a submission which the\n\nGovernment has chosen not to contest. The Working Group recalls that defendants should\n\nnot be presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals, as this also undermines the presumption of innocence.The Working Group finds a breach of article 14 (2) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following his\n\nrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters\n\nof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria. He is reportedly currently still held in a very small cell where he is exposed to daily psychological and mental torture without access to other inmates or any other person except for the Department officers. Mr. Kanu is also allegedly denied access to reading or writing materials and has been refused access to professional medical care despite a serious heart ailment.\n\n\u201cThe source reports that Mr. Kanu\u2019s life is in jeopardy and that he suffers from a medical condition occasioned by gradual depletion of potassium in his system, which has defied any medical solution given to him within the Department facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is seriously concerned about the treatment to which Mr. Kanu\n\nhas been subjected. Especially noting its finding that Mr. Kanu was subjected to\n\nextraordinary rendition as well as his treatment prior to that, the Working Group considers it unlikely that Mr. Kanu would have been able to effectively assist with and participate in his own defence during the proceedings against him, and that such treatment roceedings against him, rendering them inherently unfair and unjust, in violation of article 14 of the Covenant. For all the reasons above, the Working Group finds that the fair trial rights and procedural guarantees of Mr. Kanu under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant and other relevant human rights standards, were not observed and that such violations are of such gravity as to render Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention arbitrary under category III.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said Nigeria also failed to disprove that Kanu was a victim of political persecution.\n\n\u201cMr. Kanu is an activist and the leader of the organisation Indigenous People of Biafra,\n\nwhich he founded in 2012. The source alleges that the Government of Nigeria is targeting\n\nMr. Kanu due to his political expression, in particular, due to his membership in a group\n\npolitically opposed to the Nigerian Government on the question of Biafra, his widely published criticism of the Government, and his work with and advocacy for the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Government has chosen not to address these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu has indeed been targeted by the Government\n\nas a human rights defender on account of his freedom of opinion and expression as well as\n\nhis position regarding the sovereignty of Biafra. As Mr. Kanu has been targeted on account of his activism in galvanising momentum for a referendum on the sovereignty of Biafra, the Working Group considers that his detention violates articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1) and 26 of the Covenant, and is arbitrary under category V.\n\nConcluding remarks: \u201cThe Working Group wishes to record its very serious concern for the well-being of\n\nMr. Kanu, who, according to the source and uncontested by the Government of Nigeria,\n\nremains in solitary confinement since his arbitrary detention in Nigeria on 29 June 2021. He has been denied medical treatment and medication for his heart condition. The Working Group recalls that prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under rules 43(1)(b) and 44 of the Mandela Rules.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also obliged to remind the Government of Nigeria that in accordance with article 10 of the\n\nCovenant, all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human person and that denial of medical assistance constitutes a violation of the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 24, 25, 27 and 30 in particular.\n\n\u201d According to the source, throughout Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention in Kenya and transfer to\n\nNigeria, no family members knew about his location or could access him, and Mr. Kanu was not permitted to contact his family during this detention. These allegations have not been contested by either Governments. The Working Group stresses that, under international human rights law, all detained and imprisoned individuals have the right to communicate and be visited by their families.\n\n\u201cThe right to receive visits applies to all detainees, \u201cregardless of the offence of which they are suspected or accused.\u201d Under Principle 19 of the Body of Principles, this right could be subject only to conditions and restrictions that are appropriate to a legitimate aim. Neither Governments have argued that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family conformed with this requirement. As a result, the Working Group finds that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family violated his right to contact with the outside world under rules 43 (3) and 58 (1) of the Nelson Mandela Rules and principles 15 and 19 of the Body of Principles.\n\n\u201cNoting the treatment to which Mr. Kanu has been subjected at the hands of both\n\nKenyan and Nigerian authorities as well as his continued solitary confinement, the Working\n\nGroup refers this case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also wishes to reemphasize its very serious concern over the\n\napparent collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria in this case and reiterates its findings that both Governments are jointly responsible for the violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in both jurisdictions. The present Opinion concerns solely the treatment and rights of Mr. Kanu and is sposition\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion:\n\nIn relation to Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nThe deprivation of liberty of Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu, being in\n\ncontravention of articles 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights and articles 2, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 and 26 of the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within Categories I, II, III and V.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr. Kanu without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms, including those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201d The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the\n\ncase, the appropriate remedy would be for the Government of Nigeria to release Mr. Kanu\n\nimmediately and for both Governments to accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.\n\n\u201d In the current context of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of Nigeria to take urgent action to ensure the immediate unconditional release of Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201d The Working Group urges the two Governments to ensure a full and independent\n\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Kanu and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of hisrights.\n\n\u201d In accordance with paragraph 33 (a) of its methods of work, the Working Group refers\n\nthe present case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.\n\nFollow-up procedure:\n\n\u201cIn accordance with paragraph 20 of its methods of work, the Working Group requests\n\nthe source and the Governments to provide it with information on action taken in follow-up\n\nto the recommendations made in the present opinion, including: (a) Whether Mr. Kanu has been released and, if so, on what date;\n\n(b) Whether compensation or other reparations have been made to Mr. Kanu;\n\n(c) Whether an investigation has been conducted into the violation of Mr. Kanu\n\nrights and, if so, the outcome of the investigation; (d) Whether any legislative amendments or changes in practice have been made to harmonize the laws and practices of Kenya and Nigeria with its international obligations in line with the present opinion;\n\n(e) Whether any other action has been taken to implement the present opinion.\n\n\u201cThe Government is invited to inform the Working Group of any difficulties it may\n\nhave encountered in implementing the recommendations made in the present opinion and whether further technical assistance is required, for example through a visit by the Working Group.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the source and the Government to provide the abovementioned information within six months of the date of transmission of the present opinion.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Working Group reserves the right to take its own action in follow-up to the\n\nopinion if new concerns in relation to the case are brought to its attention. Such action would enable the Working Group to inform the Human Rights Council of progress made in\n\nimplementing its recommendations, as well as any failure to take action.\n\n\u201d The Working Group recalls that the Human Rights Council has encouraged all States\n\nto cooperate with the Working Group and has requested them to take account of its views\n\nand, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken\u201d\n\nVictory for freedom fighters \u2013 Kanu\u2019s family\n\nMeanwhile, Kanu\u2019s family has expressed delight over the UN recommendations, describing the report as victory for freedom fighters.\n\nKanu\u2019s younger brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu, who conveyed the position of the family in an exclusive interview with Vanguard, said that Nigeria must comply with the UN recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn as much as they are lawless, they must obey. After now they must still face the music because Internationally they must be held accountable.\u201d",
          "summary": "UN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\nIn these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\nSuch determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following hisrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquartersof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nManufacturing giant of mining explosives, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, yesterday, organized a capacity building training of over 50 mining companies on use of explosives at their sites this is following issues on safe- mining in the solid minerals sector.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the \u2018Two-day Technical Training In Explosives Management and Optimization\u2019 , the Founder and Chairman, NIGACHEM Nigeria Limited, Engr Sylvanus Ghasarah, represented by the Executive Director, Administration and Human Resources, Maureen Tiamiyu, explained that the company deed it fit to give back to its customers across the country through capacity building that would cushion effects of high cost of materials via optimization.\n\nGhasarah also noted that the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent, and there was need to optimize this cost to continue in business.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know how the inflation rate has gone up. We know the exchange rate, how much is gone up. So the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent.\n\n\u201cI know that our product has gone up a lot. So for us to give back a little bit to a customer to appreciate their patronage, we have put up this optimization so that even though the cost has gone up, if they can know how to manage the explosives properly, they can manage their costs more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them to be able to carry out that blast with profits. We don\u2019t want the increase in prices to affect them because sometimes some businesses are closing down. So the aim is for people to be aware. I mean, mining engineers versus the accountants in the organizations versus the owners of the business, everybody needs to come together and put their heads together; the miners need to understand that there is a cost to blasting and the better they can efficiently manage their blasting, the better for the business owners.\n\n\u201cAnd they effect of all the other factors; diesel price has gone up, exchange rate, the effect could be cushioned with optimization basically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he added that the training would be taken to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have started this at this time. We have planned to go to different regions where we have our customer cluster, like I said, is a give back to our customers and our customers all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to have one programme or another to give back to our customers\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Sales, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, Engr Bayo Yusuf, described the capacity building workshop as reawakening training for customers.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody here is not a greenhorn but professionals, and they understand the language, and what we need to do is to just follow up on the product we supply them to make sure they get the best value in the application against the value for their money for using our product\u201d, Yusuf said.\n\nOn the areas lacking among mining companies as customers, he said, \u201cThe emphasis is on security and safety of our products because of global wave of terrorism and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cExplosive if it gets into wrong hands could do a lot of damage. We have to emphasize that whoever buys our products, we have the technology, capacity, and infrastructure to be able to track and trace whatever takes our material.\n\n\u201cWe say to our customers to safeguard our products, ensure you have proper human reliability of your workers so it doesn\u2019t leak out of your premises. Leakage can hardly happen with us but when it gets to the end-user we don\u2019t have control\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also explained that there was difference between his company\u2019s product called Super Power Explosives or 90 Super Power 80, and it is not an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, rather is for civil works- mining, quarrying and oil and gas exploration\n\nHowever, he called on government to make sure roads across the country are reconstructed, rehabilitated and properly maintained, and if not safety and security of Nigerians cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of insecurity on the mining sector, the Director, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Mining and Steel Development, Engr Frank Odom, said there was need to track and monitor movement from point of manufacture to usage or storage as the case maybe, and stressed the need for companies in the mining sector to copy what Coca-cola Bottling Company, Dangote Company, and others are doing to track their trucks.\n\n\u201cThese trucks carrying mining explosives are not monitored while moving on the roads. It is important putting additional measures to know probably on your phone or tablets you can see when a material leaves from the point it was sold or conveyed from or loaded from or even the sea port and to look at it as making progress to where it will be delivered for usage or storage.\n\nThis will prevent diversion, you can raise alarm over delay on the road by calling nearest security agency, you will know what it is happening to the truck every minute.\n\nHe made it known that there will designated companies specifically for explosives movement of explosives, that would be registered and licensed for that purpose, but not there yet because mechanisms are being put together, and he added that the tracking would be done by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHowever, when those companies come on stream they would be compelled to do the same because there is no too much monitoring because it is for the same purpose in order for us not to be lost in anything or caught unawares. So that is the main purpose,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the workshop organised by NIGACHEM will boost and improve productivity of miners as far as safe mining and profitability are concerned, which is also the key in capacity building.\n\nOne of the participants at the workshop, Assistant, Manager, Section 9 (1) Manager, Mines Department, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant, Kogi State, Engr Caleb Aransiola, commended Nigachem for the capacity building and new knowledge acquired as far as optimisation is concerned.\n\nAransiola said Nigachem did not only focused on profit but showed concern to help its customers by giving back to their customers\n\n\u201cDespite two decades of practical experience on the field I still gained a lot from the resource people, who have four decades of experience, especially on the issues we are talking about I\u2019m terms of optimisation\n\n\u201cWhat I am taking back home is to make sure my employer, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant have more profit and the turnover of the business, improve on the cost analysis and making more because if the company doesn\u2019t make profit we also will be out of job.\n\n\u201cI need to improve more on safe-mining because we basically focus on blasting because blasting is the most technical aspect of mining. I need to avoid misfire which at the end we will record success; no fatality and also maximize cost\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the company has strong policy on tracking movement, use, storage and management, which no explosives have left the company since exception due to the high technology and discipline put in place to curb ay breaches, but more will be done to improve on what the company has security of explosives and movement.\n\n[7/22, 1:57 PM] Palma Jennifer: \u201cI will prioritize education, engage youths in nation building\u201d- Adebayo\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adewole Adebayo has promised to prioritize education and engage youths in leadership roles if elected as President of the country next year.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he played host to the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS in Abuja.\n\nWhile promising to represent the interest of the masses and youths through a policy that sustains and guarantees a smooth educational system, Prince Adebayo charged the student body to rise to the defense of the nation\u2019s educational sector.\n\nThe leader of the delegation and national secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Mr. Salahudeen Lukman said the visit was to interface with Presidential flag bearers of political parties on their agenda for the educational sector.\n\nLukman advocated more fundings for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by he Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.",

          "text": "By Kayode Abdulazeez\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele on Thursday commissioned a 600 million naira poultry farm project at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony the CBN governor, who was represented by Edwin Nzelu, Deputy Director and Secretary to ACGSF, Agricultural credit guarantees scheme fund, said CBN introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on creating decent job, boosting poultry production fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector and One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualized specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria being the largest producer of eggs and the second largest producer of chicken meat in Africa, demand gap for eggs and meat stands at and outstrips current supply by 1.2Million Metric Tonnes and 140,000Metric Tonnes for meat and eggs respectively.\n\n\u201cOver the years, this demand gap has driven the smuggling of unhealthy frozen chicken into the country. To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

          "text": "\u2026 Says Bayelsa Airport Is Not Downgraded\n\nBy Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Bayelsa State Government has made a clarification that the state-owned international airport had not been downgraded, as being insinuated in some quarters.\n\nHe said the absence of scheduled flights to and from the Bayelsa International Airport for a couple of weeks now was not the making or fault of the state government, but has to do with some technical issues with the two airline operators.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the clarification on Wednesday when the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Bayelsa State Council, paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Yenagoa.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo explained that two airlines, Ibom-Air and United Nigeria Airlines, were carrying out what he called D-Check on their aircraft, which had also affected their flight operations from their primary routes.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Governor, the D-Check is a major maintenance check to determine the air-worthiness of an aircraft after it had made commercial flights for a period of 10 years.\n\nHe pointed out that the state government was in touch with the management teams of both airlines, giving the assurance that normal flight operations would resume at the airport before the end of the month.\n\nHis words: \u201cI can assure you that the Governor Diri-led Administration is very much on course. I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check.

          "title": "University Strikes: More Trouble As NASU, SSANU Reject Briggs Committee Report",
          "text": "The crisis in the nation\u2019s public university system has taken a new twist as members of the Senior Staff Association of Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) rejected the report of the Professor Nimi Briggs-led renegotiation committee.\n\nBoth unions insisted that they would not be bound by the recommendations of the committee which was set up by the Federal Government to end all strikes across the nation\u2019s universities.\n\nNASU General Secretary, Peters Adeyemi, and SSANU National President, Mohammed Ibrahim, made the position of the unions known on Friday at a joint press conference in Abuja.\n\nThey said they never concluded negotiations with the committee before it submitted its recommendations to the government for implementation, stressing that such an action was a betrayal.\n\nIn a bid to resolve the crisis in the university sector, the Federal Government in March constituted a committee headed by Professor Briggs to negotiate with NASU and SSANU, as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nASUU had grounded academic activities in public universities since February 14 when the lecturers embarked on strike, a situation that became complicated when NASU and SSANU also downed tools in April.\n\nRead the full text of the press conference by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of NASU and SSANU below:\n\nThis address is coming on the heels of the recent revelations and development arising from the ongoing national strike embarked upon by the various university-based unions. The revelations leave a sour taste in the mouth and given the incendiary and combustible excitement and tensions which the developments have generated amongst our members, we feel compelled to make our position known on the status of our negotiations with the Federal Government on the ongoing industrial action.\n\nYou would recall that the Presidency convened a meeting on Thursday, 12\u2033 May, 2022 tagged \u201ctripartite plus\u201d where certain resolutions were reached on the following salient issues:\n\nRenegotiation of the FGN/2009 Agreements signed with the University-Based Unions; and\n\nIntegrity tests for the proposed payment platforms from ASUU, the JAC of NASU and SSANU and the existing platform of IPPIS by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nIt is expedient at this point, to report to the public what has transpired in respect of these two issues and the resolutions of the JAC of NASU and SSANU arising therefrom.\n\nTHE RENEGOTIATIONS OF THE FGN 2009 AGREEMENTS WITH NASU AND SSANU\n\nIn line with the terms of the Agreements reached with the two unions, the Year 2009 Agreements were supposed to have been reviewed after three years. Following agitations and industrial actions demanding a review of the agreements, it was only until 2018 that the Federal Government set up the Dr Wale Babalakin (SAN) Committee to negotiate with the unions with a view to reviewing the agreements. The Babalakin Committee took off and was meeting with the various university to be very unfortunate and a betrayal of confidence by the Committee. While it may be easy to dismiss this information as a mere rumour, our belief is confirmed by the fact that a report was truly submitted to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment in his various statements had exposed the fact that a report had been prepared and presented to the Federal Government by the Briggs Committee. The Committee which had clear Terms of Reference to renegotiate with the University-Based Unions, chose to solely review the salary and submit its report on the strength of its conclusion, surreptitiously allocating a salary increment to the two Unions even without having a single discussion on the issue with them. This is tantamount to shaving a man\u2019s head behind his back. This is an utmost breach of faith and infringement of collective bargaining processes.\n\nOn the recent directive by the President to the Honourable Minister of Education to take over negotiations with the aggrieved Unions, we wish to point out that this is a welcome development, hoping that the Federal Ministry of Education will correct the anomalies.\n\nWhile we place on record, our appreciation and commendation to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment and his team, for always filling the gap and making efforts to intercept industrial disputes, it should also be placed on record that the Federal Ministry of Education had in the past absented itself from such meetings leading to poor follow-up action on the various Memoranda of Agreements signed.\n\nThese absences of our employers have been a major albatross to all Memoranda of Action or Agreements as the case may be. It is to the commendation of the current Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, that since he assumed that office, the Ministry has been markedly more responsive to matters affecting the Unions.\n\nLet it be stated clearly, that SSANU and NASU reject any salary recommendation that would cause further disparity in the University system. There is an already existing disparity in the system which we had always closed our eyes to. To further expand that disparity would be an invitation to the greatest level of anarchy and industrial unrest ever witnessed in the University system.\n\nINTEGRITY TESTS FOR THE VARIOUS PAYMENT PLATFORMS\n\nWe commend the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) for the painstaking labour in undertaking the assignments so far. The deliberations at NITDA on the test cases of the three-payment platform-IPPIS, UTAS and U3PS-based Unions concurrently. The meetings with the Babalakin Committee were exhaustive and deliberations were robust in terms of what real negotiations should be.\n\nThe Unions, NASU and SSANU had made significant progress with respect to the issues being negotiated before the life of the Babalakin Committee was cut short in 2020. Following the disbandment of the Babalakin-led Committee, the Federal Government reconstituted the Committee this time around, led by Professor Munzaili Jibril.\n\nThe Munzali Jibril Committee commenced its assignment in 2020 and for over one year that the Committee sat, it never invited the Non-Teaching Unions for any meeting. Unlike the Babalakin Committee which had meetings with the four University based Unions concurrently, the Munzali Jibril Committee, upon our enquiry, maintained that their modus operandi was to conclude negotiations with one union and move on to another.\n\nUntil the Committee was again disbanded, it never had meetings with the NASU or SSANU negotiation teams. After the disbandment of the Munzali Committee, another Committee under the leadership of Professor Nimi Briggs was constituted in March 2022. The Briggs Committee was given three months to conclude its negotiations with the University based unions which would effectively mean that its assignment ought to have ended by June 2022.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of the Committee, so far, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU had only two meetings with the Committee. After the first meeting, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU independently was compelled to create the impression that the Committee appeared not to have had its mandates clearly spelt out by the Government.\n\nIt needs to be pointed out that at the two meetings held with the Briggs Committee by both Unions, there were no deliberations on salary increment and allowances. While the NASU and SSANU teams had presented a Memorandum of Demands that included a proposal for salary review along with appropriate salary tables, the Committee had pleaded that the two unions should take the issue of review of salaries and allowances last, because they were still interfacing with the relevant government agencies to give them appropriate offers to counter our proposals on salary review.\n\nIt is therefore shocking, to say the least, that while we have not even commenced discussions on salary review and other allowances, we received reports that the committee had gone ahead to submit a report to the Federal Government recommending a ten per cent (10%) increase for Non-Teaching Unions. This we find to have been transparent and open so far. We urge NITDA to accelerate the results processing and come up with its findings in order to lay to rest the contentious issues of a viable and enduring payment platform best suited for the Nigerian University system.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today marks the 117\u2033 day of our national strike. It needs to be reiterated that it has never been the desire of NASU and SSANU to ground the system. We have however been compelled by the shabby treatment that we as workers have received in the University system.\n\nAs of today, out of the eight issues that led to the strike, none of them has been conclusively addressed by Government. Arrears of Consequential Adjustments on Minimum Wage have only been partially paid, as in many Universities, we still have many members who have not been paid, while the Federal Universities of Agriculture have been totally left out.\n\nNo Arrears of Earned Allowances has been paid. White Papers on Visitation Panels have not been released. Staff School teachers continue to languish despite a Court judgment in their favour. Our jobs continue to be usurped by Vice-Chancellors as jobs for the boys and allocated to Academic Staff. State Universities have been badly hit by poor funding, poor governance and non-payment of salaries to workers spanning months.\n\nAs JAC of NASU and SSANU, we are determined to change the status quo. We remain undaunted and undeterred in the face of our salaries that have been stopped and threats issued to the Unions from various quarters. We thank particularly, the Nigeria Labour Congress for its various interventions in ensuring the resolution of the matter.\n\nWe also thank the Nigerian media, students, parents and other stakeholders who have shown understanding in the face of the adversities which this industrial action has caused. We urge you all to continue to appeal to the Federal Government to do the needful so that we can effectively return to our offices and jobs.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nComrade Peters Adeyemi, General Secretary, NASU and Spokesperson, SAANU/NASU JAC\n\nComrade Mohammed Ibrahim, National President, SSANU",

I am glad that you all saw the larger picture, rather than narrow, self-serving interests.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier in their speeches, the National Chairman of the party, the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu and Shettima expressed gratitude to the President for his exemplary leadership which has strengthened the party in the aftermath of the convention and primaries.\n\nAdamu said: \u2018\u2018our main goal is to see the success of the APC in the forthcoming general elections. There\u2019s no better parting gift than to ensure that the APC produces the next President.\u2019\u2019\n\nBagudu told the President that he had set a worthy precedence on internal democracy in political parties, adding, \u2018\u2018Under pressure to dictate or suggest, you were determined that the democratic process should be given the opportunity to work and what we have seen is that democratic processes can produce very excellent results. We have a Presidential candidate and a running mate, whom we are all proud of.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn his part, Shettima reiterated the willingness of Tinubu and himself to serve Nigeria with justice, equity and fairness.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018We want to solicit the support of the President once INEC lifts the ban on open-air campaigns and we want to latch on to your achievements and brand name to victory, and consolidate the leadership of the party\u201d.\n\nThe meeting was attended by President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Idris Wase; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Dimeji Bankole; former Minister of Agriculture, Audu Ogbe; former Chief of Air Staff Air Marshall Sadiq Abubakar; former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, and Senator representing Taraba South Senatorial District, Emmanuel Bwacha.\n\nAPC governors in attendance included those of Kebbi (Atiku Bagudu); Borno (Babagana Zulum); Nasarawa (Abdullahi Sule); Yobe (Mana Buni) and Gombe (Inuwa Yahaya).\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Leaders and stakeholders of Coalition of Benin Socio-cultural Organisations have opposed moves by Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki to house the returned stolen Benin artifacts in his proposed Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) which they say is alien to the Benin race.\n\nAt a World Press Conference addressed by the coalition in Benin on Friday, the leaders also accused Obaseki of disrespecting and undermining the Oba of Benin, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku\u2019 Akpolokpolo Ewuare 11, regarding housing the artifacts and insisted that he keeps to his promise to support the idea of a Benin Royal Museum for the artifacts.\n\nThey urged Obaseki to be \u201ca man of his words because EMOWAA was not what he discussed with the Oba of Benin and other prominent Benin elders in 2018.\u201d\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe coalition said Obaseki, by his actions, had reneged on his words and that it was tantamount to betrayal of public trust.\n\nThey alleged that the proposed EMOWAA project was not owned by the Edo State Government but by Obaseki\u2019s private venture called Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd.\n\nThe coalition states: \u201cThe attention of the leaders and stakeholders of Coalition of Benin Socio Cultural Organisations has been drawn to Governor Obaseki\u2019s statement where he asserted that he doesn\u2019t have conflict with our revered Monarch over his proposed EMOWAA.\n\n\u201cSincerely, we were shocked that His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki asserted that he doesn\u2019t have any issue nor quarrel with our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom whereas when he organised a Stakeholders engagement meeting regarding his proposed EMOWAA phase 1, he didn\u2019t involve our revered Palace.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, you didn\u2019t only have issue or conflict with our revered Monarch over your EMOWAA, you also have issue with all the Benins for always disrespecting and undermining our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom. For avoidance of doubt, the word EMOWAA is alien to us as Benin people.\u201d\n\nThey said the Coalition had been at the forefront \u201cof advocating and assisting our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom to ensure that our stolen artifacts are returned to the Palace.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition thus raised a number of posers for Obaseki: \u201cWe would like to ask His Excellency, who owns the proposed Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) which is alien to the Benin race\n\n\u201cIs the proposed EMOWAA project owned by the Edo State Government or owned by your Private Venture called Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd?\n\n\u201cIf Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) belongs to your Private Venture known as Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd with its Office in Lagos, then why are you as our Governor treating it as a Government project using state resources?\n\n\u201cWe also would want to inquire from His Excellency, why you reneged on your earlier promise regarding the Benin Royal Museum in 2018 when you supported the idea of a Benin Royal Museum before the EMOWAA idea came from the blues.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition said it has nothing against Obaseki\u2019s plans to build Museums or set up privately owned ventures like Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd or EMOWAA \u201cas long as the artifacts that will constitute the proposed Museums are not part of the stolen historical Benin artifacts which are the Cultural Heritage of the Benin people; which rightly belongs to our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom, as the custodian of Benin Culture, Customs, and Traditions, whom we earlier said that these Artifacts were made for by the various Royal guilds of Benin, and was looted from Oba Ovonranmwen in 1897.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition continued: \u201cAnd it has already been settled as at last year that the proposed Benin Royal Museum would take custody of these Benin Artifacts on behalf of his Majesty not EMOWAA the flagship project of your Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, as long as these Historical Benin Artifacts will not constitute the Artifacts of the proposed EMOWAA Museum, then we have nothing against your EMOWAA but as long as these stolen Benin Artifacts are what will constitute your proposed EMOWAA, then consider it as pipedream because we will collectively resist such move.\n\n\u201cWe would like to remind His Excellency that your position as the Executive Governor of Edo state is time bound but our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom is not time bound, so whatever decision you take, the long term effect is what we are looking at.\n\n\u201cWhy is the Executive Director of the proposed EMOWAA an Igbo Man, Mr. Philip Ihanacho? His Excellency, we would like to ask you and the Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd, are there no Benins\u2019 that are qualified for the position of Executive Director in the proposed EMOWAA that is to be established in Benin City?\n\n\u201cWe expected that as a Benin man, His Excellency would have appointed Edo Person to chair his private venture, Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd in order to protect the Edo interest and use it as an opportunity to train young Edo people in that field which is a component of the course at hand.\n\n\u201cIf the primary intention of the proposed EMOWAA is to promote Benin Cultural Heritage, then is it not proper that an Edo person occupies such a position? We also learnt that the proposed site of the proposed EMOWAA is Ogbe-Ezoti.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, we all know that landmass of Edo South is not small, and that Ogbe-Ezoti happens to be an important Historical and Cultural Site in Benin Kingdom and that of the Oba of Benin.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, are you not aware that Ogbe-Ezoti (Aro-Ezoti) is one of the Cultural and Historical Sites in Benin Kingdom? Why would you destroy a legacy in an attempt to create another?\n\nAre there no other locations/lands in the whole of Edo South that are suitable?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, we hope that Benin Artifacts manufactured by the Royal guilds of Benin for the Obas of Benin in pre-colonial times which was looted from the Royal Palace of Benin in 1897 will not be part of what you intend to store in the proposed EMOWAA?\n\n\u201cWe want to state unequivocally that these Benin Artifacts belong to his Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin Kingdom and the entire Benin Kingdom. Just like the proverbial saying goes Aigbuobasimwin Aiguobatile. For clarity, our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom is the owner of these Benin artifacts.\n\n\u201cIf the Governor is so much keen on developing the Art and Tourism sector, then it is proper thing for you to liaise with the our revered Oba who would give the nod to these royal guilds of Benin Artisans in order to collaborate with the government in replicating these stolen Artifacts, and even producing other Artifacts for the Edo State Government, for your EMOWAA.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that since His Excellency is keen on promoting Benin Arts and Culture, which is realistic and profitable, for him to do so by actualising the establishment of an Edo State Art Gallery.\u201d\n\nSignatories to the declaration of the Coalition include Mr. Osazee Amas-Edobor, Coordinator General; Mr. Iyamu Osaro Culture Secretary General; Maxist Kola Edokpayi, Public Relations Officer; Comrade Osaze Eriamiantoe, Director of Planning; Charity Ozigbo-Esere, Director of Gender Affairs; Comrade Collins A.

          "text": "The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for 2023 and former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, spoke to ARISE News on his frequent attempts at becoming the president of Nigeria since 1992, declaring that the driving force behind his persistence \u201cis the desire to serve my country and its people.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president stated this and more in an exclusive interview, his first after being elected presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\nOn not picking the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, as his running mate for the 2023 election, Atiku said Wike was not rejected but he simply picked a running mate that he believes he could work with amicably.\n\nAtiku also said he refused the proposition of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to be his running mate in 2007 because of his aversion to a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAtiku said his frequent shots at the presidency has its place in history, citing the case of Abraham Lincoln who ran up to five or six times before becoming the president of the United States of America.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn politics or even in history, we have several leaders around the world who have made attempts to serve their country.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest presidents in American history is Abraham Lincoln. This was somebody who ran up to five or six times to be the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cAt this my age, and what I have been able to accomplish, I don\u2019t think I desire anything other than the passion to serve my country and my fellow countrymen.\n\n\u201cSo, this is what is the driving force behind my persistence and desire to serve my country and its people.\n\n\u201cBasically, I\u2019m driven by the passion and desire to give back to this country and my society what the country has done for me. If I were to be born around this time, I don\u2019t think I would have been that fortunate or likely to become what I have become today. So, I am more or less driven by the passion to give back to society what this country has given so much to me.\u201d\n\nAtiku also went down memory lane, saying, \u201ceven when I wanted to be the governor of my state, from the old Gongola State to Adamawa State, I ran four times before eventually I was elected as the state governor but I never served, as I became the Vice President.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on what informed his choice of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate over Wike, he said Wike was not rejected as being suggested in some quarters but simply picked a running mate that he believes he could work with amicably.\n\nHe also said he did not go outside the recommendations of the committee he set up for the purpose.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is the prerogative of the presidential candidate to pick his running mate, a running mate that he believes he can work with amicably and also deliver the policies of the party and also try to unify the country.\u201d\n\nHe said he had always looked towards the South-east for his running mate whenever he got the presidential ticket, stating, \u201cI was given a ticket in 2007, I picked a South-easterner, I was given a ticket in 2019, I picked an Igbo, and now I have been given a ticket in 2022, and I picked an Igbo man, consecutively. This is just to show you my desire to unify the country.\u201d\n\nHe described Wike as \u201ca brilliant, courageous and tenacious politician that really has a future in the political evolution of this country. So, it is not about rejection.\u201d\n\nAtiku then set the record straight: \u201cThey recommended three names, because they knew it was my prerogative to pick any one of the three. Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew there was no vote taken. I have the report of the committee and the committee said \u2018we are recommending the following\u2019 and out of the three people, I picked one. I did not go outside that recommendation. People should be fair to me and state the facts.\u201d\n\nRegardless, he said there was fence mending going on to assuage Wike: \u201cWe are reaching out to Wike and talking to him, very soon, we will resolve our internal crises.\u201d\n\nAs for Okowa, he said his running mate is very brilliant and experienced, having served from the local government, to the state as a commissioner and to the National Assembly and then government.\n\nAtiku said, \u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our governors, the National Working Committee, board of trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a president-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on whether he would have picked Peter Obi, who is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, and what he believes are Obi\u2019s chances in the presidential race, he said Okowa and Obi were two different people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Peter Obi did not consult me but told me three days after he joined the Labour Party,\u201d said the former vice president.\n\nOn Obi\u2019s chances against him, Atiku said, \u201cPeter Obi is not a threat. I really don\u2019t expect the Labour Party to take as many votes from the PDP as people are suggesting. They have no governor, or in the National Assembly. We could have seen it in the last election in Osun State. What was the performance of the Labour Party?\n\n\u201cThen again, they (Obi\u2019s supporters) are talking about social media. Mind you, in the north, 90 per cent of our people (who will be voting) are not on social media.\u201d\n\nOn the APC\u2019s Muslim-Muslim ticket, Atiku said he fundamentally disagrees with Tinubu on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket in the presidential race.\n\nAtiku said his disagreement with Tinubu on the same religion ticket dated back to 2007 in their days in the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) when Tinubu insisted on being his running mate.\n\n\u201cMy fundamental disagreement and political departure with Asiwaju since 2007 was due to the Muslim-Muslim ticket. \u201cRemember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed ACN.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yar\u2019Adua. That was the parting point.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership. It is unwelcoming and unripe for Nigeria as a democratic state.\u201d\n\nOn his relationship with Tinubu, he said, \u201cWe are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that.\u201d\n\nOn zoning in the PDP, he said, \u201cthere is no microzoning in the PDP\u201d but that there is a policy on rotation between the North and the South, stating that if he is voted president, then the Chairman of the PDP, Iyocha Ayu would resign.\n\nHe also discussed security matters in the country, stating that agitations in parts of the country would be unnecessary if every part of the country was given a sense of belonging.\n\nHe said it was curious that all the 17 security outfits in the country were headed by people from a particular section of the country, that there were fewer policemen than required, stating that under his watch, more policemen would be recruited.\n\nThe former VP who said he was an advocate of state police, added that the police should be well trained and equipped and to make it constitutional for police to be at all levels of administration.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of removal of subsidy, stating that it was inevitable and that as Vice President, he chaired a committee charged with this task. \u201cWhen I was vice president, we had designed subsidy removal in four stages, and I was the chairman of the subsidy removal committee. At that time, I worked very closely with former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who was then president of the NLC. We removed subsidy phase one and phase two. By the time we finished phase two, we had left office. I believe this can be done in the future through negotiations.\u201d\n\nOn stemming the incessant collapses of the national power grid, he advocated the decentralisation of power generation and transmission, with consideration of renewables like solar, hydro electricity from mini dams, gas powered electricity, where applicable, among others.\n\nThe transition of the NNPC from a public corporation to a limited liability company, he said, was still shrouded in secrecy, stating that the government needed to be more transparent about the future of the company.\n\nFor instance, he wondered what the position or fate of the oil- bearing states and communities would be under this new NNPC, and promised to open up the company to include the states and oil-bearing areas.\n\nBennett Oghifo",

          "text": "Russia and Ukraine signed a landmark deal on Friday to reopen Ukrainian Black Sea ports for grain exports, raising hopes that an international food crisis aggravated by the Russian invasion can be eased.\n\nThe accord crowned two months of talks brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, a NATO member that has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine and controls the straits leading into the Black Sea.\n\nSpeaking at the signing ceremony in Istanbul, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the deal opens the way to significant volumes of commercial food exports from three key Ukrainian ports \u2013 Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny.\n\n\u201cToday, there is a beacon on the Black Sea. A beacon of hope\u2026, possibility\u2026and relief in a world that needs it more than ever,\u201d Guterres told the gathering.\n\nBut fighting raged on unabated in Ukraine\u2019s east and, underlining the enmity and mistrust driving the worst conflict in Europe since World War Two, Russian and Ukrainian representatives declined to sit at the same table and avoided shaking hands at the ceremony.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy doused hopes that the accord might nudge the conflict nearer a resolution, signalling in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that Kyiv had little appetite for an early ceasefire.\n\nA blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, trapping tens of millions of tonnes of grain in silos and stranding many ships, has worsened global supply chain bottlenecks and, along with sweeping Western sanctions, stoked galloping inflation in food and energy prices around the world.\n\nMoscow has denied responsibility for the worsening food crisis, blaming instead sanctions for slowing its own food and fertilizer exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its Black Sea ports.\n\nA U.N. official said a separate pact signed on Friday would smooth such Russian exports and that the United Nations welcomed U.S. and European Union clarifications that their sanctions would not apply to their shipment.\n\nMoscow has denied responsibility for the worsening food crisis, blaming instead sanctions for slowing its own food and fertilizer exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its Black Sea ports.\n\nA U.N. official said a separate pact signed on Friday would smooth such Russian exports and that the United Nations welcomed U.S. and European Union clarifications that their sanctions would not apply to their shipment.\n\nUkraine\u2019s infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov also said that Kyiv does not see a risk of Russian ships attacking through the ports as they would be vulnerable to Ukrainian missile strikes. read more\n\nSenior U.N. officials, briefing reporters on Friday, said the deal was expected to be fully operational in a few weeks and would restore grain shipments from the three reopened ports to pre-war levels of 5 million tonnes a month.\n\nSafe passage into and out of the ports would be guaranteed in what one official called a \u201cde facto ceasefire\u201d for the ships and facilities covered, they said, although the word \u201cceasefire\u201d was not in the agreement text.\n\nThough Ukraine has mined nearby offshore areas as part of its defences against Russia\u2019s five-month-old invasion, Ukrainian pilots would guide ships along safe channels in its territorial waters, they said.\n\nMonitored by a Joint Coordination Center based in Istanbul, the ships would then transit the Black Sea to Turkey\u2019s Bosphorus strait and proceed to world markets.\n\nThe overall objective is to help avert famine among tens of millions of people in poorer nations by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil, fertilizer and other products into world markets including for humanitarian needs, partly at lower prices.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said he hoped the accord offered an opportunity to resolve the wider conflict.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these agreements represent a first step towards concrete prospects for peace, in terms that are acceptable to Ukraine,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy told the Wall Street Journal a pause that allowed Russia to keep Ukrainian territory would only encourage a wider war.\n\n\u201cFreezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest,\u201d the newspaper reported Zelenskiy as saying. read more\n\n\u201cSociety believes that all the territories must be liberated first, and then we can negotiate about what to do and how we could live in the centuries ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States believes Russia\u2019s military is sustaining hundreds of casualties a day, a senior U.S. defense official said. The official said Washington also believed Ukraine had destroyed more than 100 \u201chigh-value\u201d Russian targets in Ukraine, including command posts and air-defence sites.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is considering whether it can send fighter jets to Ukraine in the future, a White House spokesman told reporters. read more\n\nThere have been no major breakthroughs on front lines since Russian forces seized the last two Ukrainian-held cities in eastern Luhansk province in late June and early July.\n\nKyiv hopes that its gradually increasing supply of Western arms, such as U.S. High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), will allow it to recapture lost territories.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said on Friday its forces had destroyed four HIMARS systems between July 5-20. Kyiv denied the claims, calling them \u201cfakes\u201d meant to sap Western support for Ukraine. Reuters could not verify the assertions.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to demilitarise its neighbour and rid it of dangerous nationalists.\n\nKyiv and the West say Russia is mounting an imperialist campaign to reconquer a pro-Western neighbour that broke free of Moscow\u2019s rule when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.",
