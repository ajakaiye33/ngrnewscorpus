          "title": "Defend allegations against you, group tells Ogun gov",
          "text": "\u2026allegations baseless, says state govt\n\nA political pressure group, Ogun Bibire Unity Forum, has called on the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, to address the allegation that he committed criminal offences in the United States in the 80s and other possible constitutional infractions.\n\nThe group, through its Organising Secretary, Oluwatobi Sofela, in a statement on Tuesday, said it was in possession of a petition against the governor\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nIt said the petition was submitted on April 12, 2022, by a member of the All Progressives Congress, Mr Ayodele Oludiran, to the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu.\n\nIn the petition, Abiodun was accused of concealing criminal offences he allegedly committed in the US.\n\nReacting, Sofela stated that the chance of the APC retaining the governorship seat in the state would be in jeopardy if the governor refused to defend the allegations.\n\nHe also called Abiodun\u2019s attention to alleged irregularities in the educational qualifications he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nSofela said, \u201cIs it correct that while filling the columns for his educational qualifications in the INEC Form CF001 for the office of Governor of Ogun State in 2019, under \u2018Primary School Attended,\u2019 Abiodun recorded and claimed that he attended International Primary School Ayetoro in 1971, while in his 2015 INEC Form CF001 while vying to represent Ogun East at the Senate, he recorded and claimed to have attended another primary school, Comprehensive High School, Ayetoro, in the same 1971?\n\n\u201cDid he graduate from the University of Ife in 1986? Did he obtain \u2018BBA (Hons) Accounting\u2019 at the Kennesaw State Universities in 1989? Was he jailed in 1986 for credit card fraud in Miami Dade, Florida, USA? Did he use a pseudonym (Shawn Michael Davids) with the aim of concealing his criminal identity? Was he jailed for committing criminal offences which bordered on credit card fraud, petty theft and cheque forgery?\n\n\u201cWas he arrested on November 7, 1986, for fighting and injuring a police officer in an attempt to resist arrest? Is it true that his jail number was 8600B9436? Did he apply for the redaction of his criminal records in Miami Dade, Florida? Was the redaction granted in August 2015?\u201d\n\nHe said the educational records presented by the governor could have him disqualified, as enshrined in Section 182 (1) (j) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThis is as he warned that opposition parties will take advantage of the situation and test Abiodun\u2019s eligibility to stand for elections.\n\n\u201cMore so, no one could attend two different primary schools and finish both at the same time as presented by Governor Abiodun in his INEC forms. Our fear for our great party in the forthcoming elections is that since the report of Governor Abiodun\u2019s questionable primary school claims are in the public domain already, the opposition parties shall test his eligibility to stand for elections within the stipulated 14 days cause of action (pre-election matters) as provided for in the Constitution and Electoral Act 2022 (as amended).\n\n\u201cIf action is not taken, the chances of our great party, the APC, retaining the governorship seat in Ogun State shall be in jeopardy as previously seen in Bayelsa and Zamfara States,\u201d Sofela said.\n\nWhen our correspondent made a phone call to the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, he pleaded for communication to be done via SMS or Whatsapp.\n\nHe has, however, yet to respond to the allegations as of the time of filing this report.\n\nHowever, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Communications, Remi Hassan, when contacted, described the allegations as baseless.\n\nAccording to him, the group should await the result of the investigation on the petition being carried out by the Police and the Department of State Services, instead of expecting an explanation from his principal.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe governor was asked to tell the truth about the allegations and also speak concerning his credentials. We responded saying the petition was addressed to the Police and the DSS. And at that level, if you have asked agencies with statutory powers to investigate a matter, it\u2019s just ideal that you let them do their job since you have gone that far to petition those agencies.\n\n\u201cSo, the 14-day ultimatum would have been better addressed to those policing agencies to quickly come up with a report of whatever investigation that they are doing. But our immediate reaction as a government to those allegations is that they are baseless.\u201d\n\nHe added that in the build-up to the 2019 elections, issues around the credentials of the governor became a subject of litigation up to the Supreme Court level but the governor won the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Afe Babalola & Co., the legal counsel to the Ogun State Governor, in a letter to the National Chairman of the APC, addressed allegations of discrepancies in the Governor\u2019s educational background.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cThe allegation that discrepancies exist in our client\u2019s Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 is statute-barred. This allegation can only form the basis of a cause of action in court 14 days from the day our client filled and deposed to these forms.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a suit seeking to declare the content of these forms false ought to have been filed within 14 days from the day our client deposed to these forms. Please see Section 285 (9) and Section 285 (14) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)\u2026\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that Abiodun was indicted and imprisoned in the 80s, the letter described it as false and misleading.\n\n\u201cOur client has never been indicted or convicted for the commission of any crime.\n\n\u201cAssuming without conceding that the allegation that our client was arrested and detained in 1986 in the US is accurate, we state that the fact of our client\u2019s arrest and detention as far back as 1985 do not constitute a ground for his ineligibility to run for the 2023 governorship election,\u201d the letter read, citing Section 29 (6) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Bayelsa West: Purported Zoning arrangement has not been respected, says Group",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Henry Umoru, ABUJA\n\nA group under the aegis of Bayelsa West Youth Congress has raised the alarm that a group of politicians and their cronies are deliberately twisting history in an attempt to confuse and create needless tension among the good people of the Senatorial District on a purported zoning arrangement in the area.\n\nAccording to the group, what had happened over the years is a healthy contest of political parties pairing up candidates with the potential to win elections in the two local government councils making up the district.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by the National Coordinator of the Group, Comrade Ebide Brown lamented that the whole noise about zoning is a mischievous attempt by a group of politicians to make a sacrilegious attempt to disenfranchise Senator Henry Seriake Dickson from participating in the next election.\n\nEbide Brown who traced the history of Electoral contest in the Senatorial district from 1999, said that there has been zoning of the positions in the district, just as he recalled that in the contest for the first elections in District in 1999, Senator Emmanuel Diffa and AVM Larry Koinyan all came all from Sagbama while the Candidate for the House of Representatives candidate, Chief Clement Andie, from Sagbama win the election.\n\nBrown recalled that in 2003 Chief JK Brambaifa, (PDP) Sen. Emmanuel Difa- SALGA (PDP), all from Sagbama, Chief (Barr) Ebikake Abeke- EKELGA ( PDP)contested the Senatorial election which was eventually won by Senator Brambaifa while Chief Enai who was PDP flag bearer to the House of Reps won dressing that there was zoning.\n\nHe stated further that Senator Heineken Lokpobiri from Ekeremor wouldn\u2019t have contested for the third term against Foster Ogola from Sagbama in 2015 in violation of the terms of the purported agreement, adding that even in 2019, Captain Karimo contested against Foster Ogola. Both men are from\n\nSagbama. He stressed that under a respected government the APC wouldn\u2019t have fielded a candidate against a Sagbama Senatorial candidate since Hon Fred Agbedi, an Ekeremor man was already in the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to him, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo (Sagbama) contested against Captain Karimo of the APC, another Sagbama politician under the platform of the APC, just as he noted that if there were a serious zoning political arrangement, the APC whose members and a handful of PDP saboteurs who are insisting on zoning wouldn\u2019t have sponsored Hon Peremobowei Ebebi against Senator Dickson in 2020.\n\nEbebi Brown wondered what would have happened to the purported zoning arrangement if Ebebi had defeated Senator Dickson in the heavily contested election where Ebebi polled over 20000 votes.\n\nHe urged Bayelsans and well-meaning Nigerians to ignore the mischief designed to hand over the Senatorial District to the APC, even as he said that serious minded politicians with the right credentials go for campaign and not blackmail.\n\nEbide Brown recalled that Ekeremor political leaders agreed unanimously to contribute the money for the expression of interest and nomination forms for Senator Dickson because of his record of perform, the merit of his brand of representation and proven love for the people over the years.",

Lagos Island is a low lying area which explains the convergence of water.\n\nHe added that as a follow up to the meeting with representatives of the protesters, officials of the ministry will also visit Ilubirin on Saturday with residents to have a first hand experience of the level of the water.\n\nEarlier, the spokesperson for the protesters, Mr. Mukadass Maja, while speaking, said their demand for a lasting solution is to pull down the embarkment that prevent ingress of water from the lagoon, to allow free flow of water.\n\nAccording to Maja, \u201cMost of our streets, shops, mosques, churches, police stations and schools in the areas are seriously flooded and is affecting the economy of the areas and the state by extention.\n\nSome of the affected areas include: Ojo Giwa, Jankara, Idu Garan, Okoya among others while, some affected schools include: King Ado High School and St. Patrick Primary school.",

          "text": "Adamawa youths have staged a protest in the state capital, Yola, yesterday over an alleged plan by the State House of Assembly to remove a member who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe member, Ayuba Joseph Kwada, who represents Michika State Constituency in the State House of Assembly, had, at the weekend, announced his defection from the PDP to the APC, saying the PDP and Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had been sidelining him in activities and decisions that should involve him.\n\nHis defection from the PDP allegedly caused panic within the House leadership and in the state government, and talk became rife that the House would, at its sitting yesterday, remove Ayuba by declaring his seat vacant.\n\nThat the PDP enjoyed only a slight majority of 14 members to APC\u2019s 11 members while Ayuba was still in PDP, gave strength to the speculation that the PDP government was desperate not to let Ayuba go unpunished.\n\nSo, it was rumoured yesterday that the House would, at the day\u2019s sitting, declare Ayuba\u2019s seat vacant.\n\nPro-Ayuba youths had responded by gathering in front of the House of Assembly Complex in Yola as early as 9:00 a.m., protesting the alleged plan to remove Ayuba.\n\nAyuba, in a chat with reporters at his Yola residence, while the protest was on around the Assembly Complex, said he left the PDP because the PDP and Governor Ahmadu Fintiri were making him look like an orphan and he needed a refuge.\n\n\u201cI was left in the sun and I could no longer bear the heat. So, I left for the APC where I would find shade,\u201d Ayuba said.\n\nOn the alleged plan to declare his seat vacant, he said: \u201cI heard all that, but I don\u2019t know how they will do it. Not long ago, Musa Bororo (who represents Mubi South in the House of Assembly) left the APC for the PDP. His seat was not declared vacant. I don\u2019t know how they will do this one.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent reports that when the House of Assembly eventually had its sitting yesterday, no mention was made of Ayuba\u2019s defection.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Aminu Iya Abbas led members in the sitting, treated three bills, but said nothing about Ayuba Kwada.\n\nNot a word was uttered by either the Speaker or any member until the House adjourned sitting to today.\n\nThe silence of the House on the Ayuba issue gave rise to the fresh speculation that the House is resting its alleged plan for another day.",

A lot of economic activities have been down before; that\u2019s why we are recording insecurity and other related issues everywhere. We are ready to adhere to the dos and don\u2019ts regarding contraband items and other related laws.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Abubakar Idrisu resident, also said though the government has denied them several benefits previously due to the closure, with the reopening of the border, their neglected plight will be salvaged.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe government has really assisted us with the reopening of the border. Jibia Border is just like a refinery built for us. At least, we can feed ourselves and go about our daily business activities.\u201d\n\nA food vendor, Hajiya Maryam Mai Abinci, said she has recovered from the plight of border closure after a few days of reopening.\n\nShe said: \u201cTruthfully, within these few days, I have recorded tremendous success.

Click Here For Details .\n\nASUU Chairman, Abuja Chapter. Dr. Kassim Umaru, who confirmed the withholding of salaries, said it was part of government\u2019s plot to intimate the striking workers.\n\n\u201cOf course, since March we have not had a salary; it is no longer news. That is the way the Nigerian government normally intimidates workers. There was a time, especially this very government, that our salaries were stalled for six, seven months because we embarked on a legitimate cause, a patriotic course to salvage the university system. But all we know is that they are keeping our money for us because the nature of our job is clear. If you don\u2019t do the first semester, you cannot go for the second semester. So, whenever they are ready to call us back, by implementing what we agreed on in our MOA, they will go back and pay us our salaries, then we will resume, because we also have a policy of \u201cNo pay, no work.\u201d\n\nMr. Yemi Yusuf, a parent of three undergraduates of public universities said: \u201cThe Federal Government is trying to worsen an already bad case by enforcing the \u201cNo work no pay labour clause\u201d because the system is likely going to collapse totally. Why is it difficult for the FG to keep pacts it signed with varsity lectures? They\u2019re asking for their dues and this strike must not be mischievously misconstrued to mean the government is being blackmailed. Rather than enforce the needless rule of no pay, no work, let the FG fulfil all outstanding obligations it has with ASUU.\u201d\n\nThe unions recently lamented that despite all the notices and letters sent to the Federal Government to address their grievances so that the strike is called off, the government has failed to acknowledge the letters or invite them for discussions.\n\nASUU was the first to launch a four-week warning strike on February 14 which it extended at its expiration alleging the government had failed to address the contentious issues that prompted the strike.\n\nIn March, the Joint Action Committee (JAC), comprising the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institution, NASU, Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) followed with a two-week warning strike, which it also extended within the same month, while the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) also embarked on a two-week warning strike later that same month.",

          "text": "\u2022Over 40 million Nigerians on microblogging platform\n\nWorld\u2019s richest man, billionaire Elon Musk has reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for approximately $44 billion, the company said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, had said he wants to buy Twitter because he thinks it\u2019s not living up to its potential as a platform for \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nHe said it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the \u201csocietal imperative\u201d of free speech.\n\nTwitter said it would become a privately held company after the sale is closed.\n\n\u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,\u201d its CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. \u201cDeeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nMusk describes himself as a \u201cfree-speech absolutist,\u201d although he hasn\u2019t been exactly clear what he means by that. In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he\u2019d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he\u2019d be \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nThe shares of Twitter, which has over 40 million Nigerians on its platform, were up 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading in New York at $51.15.\n\nMusk, a prolific Twitter user, has said it needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe 50-year-old entrepreneur, who is also CEO of rocket developer SpaceX, has said he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price and banning advertising.\n\nThe billionaire, a vocal advocate of cryptocurrencies, has also suggested adding dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nHe had said Twitter\u2019s current leadership team was incapable of getting the company\u2019s stock to his offer price on its own, but stopped short of saying it needs to be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\u201d Musk said in his offer letter last week.\n\nUp to the point Musk disclosed a stake in Twitter in April, the company\u2019s shares had fallen about 10 per cent since Parag Agrawal took over as CEO from founder Jack Dorsey in late November.\n\nThe deal came just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter\u2019s board to take his offer more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. Before Musk revealed the financing package, Twitter\u2019s board was expected to reject the bid, sources had said.\n\nThe sale represented an admission by Twitter that Agrawal was not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter\u2019s shares were trading higher than Musk\u2019s offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk unveiled his intention to buy Twitter on April 14, and take it private via a financing package comprised of equity and debt.\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest lenders, except those advising Twitter, have all committed to provide debt financing.\n\nMusk\u2019s negotiating tactics \u2013 making one offer and sticking with it \u2013 resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions. Musk did not provide any financing details when he first disclosed his offer for Twitter, making the market skeptical about its prospects.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Afenifere, Others Want Tinubu, Osinbajo, Southwest Aspirants to Withdraw from Presidential Race, Say It\u2019s Turn of S\u2019East",
          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022Declare Yoruba\u2019s presidential bid inelegant\n\n\u2022Say unfortunate Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and other major socio political groups in different parts of the country, including Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), have called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other South West aspirants to withdraw from the 2023 presidential race, insisting it is the turn of the South East to produce President.\n\nThe call is coming as political parties set for their primaries ahead of the 2023 general election. The call by the prominent socio-political groups reflects the sentiment in the country which increasingly favours the emergence of a president of Igbo extraction.\n\nAfenifere, PANDEF and Middle Belt Forum insisted the South East should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023 for equity, justice and fairness. The groups maintained that if the political class and the retired military generals could concede the presidency to the Yoruba in 1999, the same approach could be adopted to micro-zone power to the Igbo.\n\nThey described the Yoruba presidential ambition as awkward.\n\nThe groups spoke in Abuja at the Greater Nigeria Conference, organised by leaders and friends of the South East Geo-political zone, with the theme, \u201cTogether We Can.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the different groups also condemned what they called a doomed 2023 presidential desire by former President Goodluck Jonathan, saying he would merely be presenting himself for shame.\n\nAfenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, while addressing the conference, said there was need for aspirants from the south, especially, the Igbo, to be united. Adebanjo said the decisions of presidential aspirants, like Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Ameachi, and the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, both from the South-south, to contest would only give the north undue advantage over the south.\n\nStating emphatically that the north did not want to leave power in 2023, Adebanjo explained, \u201cI only like to point to the fact that they are just deceiving you. All that you are hearing that they (the north) are supporting the South-west is an element of deceit to deprive you, to be able to rule you. They don\u2019t like anybody!\n\n\u201cI told Bola (Tinubu) himself, not in the papers, face-to-face, \u2018You believe this man (Buhari) will make you president?\u2019 He said yes. I said, \u2018he wanted to make you president, he asked (Yemi) Osinbajo to contest? He asked (Kayode) Fayemi to contest, he asked Amosun (Ibikunle) to contest? All in the South-west, why? He wanted to divide the Yoruba first.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is that President Goodluck Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced by mentioning the fact that he was considering whether to be president, for what?\u201d\n\nAdebanjo wondered why political leaders from the north were now propounding a lot of theories, when they realised it was the turn of the Igbo to produce the president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow that it is the turn of the Igbo, they are propounding a new theory: it must be based on merit and all that. If it is the question of merit, if it has been based on merit till today, till Kingdom comes, the Igbo alone will produce the president.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader noted that all the talk about aspirants from the south going to lobby, campaign, and sell themselves was all rigmarole, stressing that the north knows the truth.\n\nAdebanjo advised, \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t like all the people that came out from the east. But for the fact that they are saying you have no people, I\u2019m happy you demonstrated that. But go and unite. A house divided against itself will not stand.\u201d\n\nPANDEF leader, Chief Edwin Clark, also appealed for concession of the presidency to the Igbo in 2023. Clark said Nigeria could not be described as a tripod anymore, because of the country\u2019s current \u201c36 legs\u201d. He said if any part of these \u201c36 legs\u201d got broken, the country would not be at ease, stressing that is what the country is experiencing today.\n\nClark stated, \u201cThe young ones who belong to the disadvantaged legs are fighting and people are pretending not to know why. The other part of this disturbing issue is the question of who has the right over Nigeria? Who is that child, from what part of Nigeria? Who will say no, you cannot destroy our country? You can no longer relegate us to the background.\n\n\u201cWhat right does the antagonist have that the protagonist does not have? What right do you have that the man you are accusing of disturbing you does not have? The reality is that the man, who wants to destroy and the one who is preventing the destruction have equal rights.\n\n\u201cWhy the Igbo should have the presidency is because the children from that geo-political zone are asking whether their own leg is k-legged, or deformed or broken, thus, resulting in the inability of their zone to present the president?\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman noted that if five or more legs out of the 36 legs of the pot were broken, definitely, the pot would be unable to stand. He said during the civil war, one out of the original three legs of the three-legged pot was broken due to the war, and the Igbo, which was the broken leg, had been marginalised in the political equation of Nigeria.\n\nInsisting that the people of the Igbo deserved to have a sense of belonging in Nigeria, Clark stressed, \u201cSo, the clamour for a president for the South-east geo-political zone is supported by me. Today, with no other tangible reason for still wanting to hold on to power, some people are talking about merit and competence. To these people, my response is simple: we must all woo and win each other, because every part of this country has a beautiful bride and every part has a handsome groom.\n\n\u201cIt will not cost money or anything to make Nigeria better. All that is required is for us to demonstrate reciprocal respect, love and understanding to one another. Let us do what is right; let us accommodate one another, and be fair to one another. Let all other Nigerians support a south-eastern candidate for president, come 2023.\n\n\u201cI repeat, very soon, I will be 95 years old. I have spent more than 70 years of this period in Nigerian affairs. I have seen it all. For the peace and sanity of the country, I appeal to all, in the name of the Almighty God, to make this concession to the Igbo, to present a president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDelivering his keynote address, leader of MBF, Dr. Poju Bitrus, said the north should have a rethink of its 2023 presidential ambition, stressing that Nigerians are not fools.\n\nBitrus said it was unfortunate there were people who felt without terrorising the country, they could not continue to rule.\n\nBitrus stated, \u201cIf we look at what is happening in this country now, someone could be surprised why the north, after the monumental failures within this period, will even be contemplating to again want to rule after Buhari. But the unfortunate thing is that everybody thinks if one of theirs is not there, they will be short-changed. How, is the question?\u201d\n\nHe said it would be disingenuous for anyone in 2022 to argue that where the president of Nigeria came from did not matter. If it did not matter, he stated, northern governors and sitting governors would not jeopardise the chances of their own party and give the presidency to the opposition in 2015.\n\nThe MBF leader said it was shocking that the same characters that were groaning in 2014 over zoning in PDP were now arguing that the zone that produced the president did not matter.\n\nBitrus stated that by 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari would have spent eight years as president, adding that it is only fair and equitable that a Nigerian from the southern part of the country occupies the position of president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the collective wisdom of the departing military and the political class, it was agreed that zoning presidential power to the south-westerner was the most expedient thing to do. At the end of the day, two south-westerners in the persons of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, representing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Chief Olu Falae, representing an alliance of All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) emerged.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 scenario is something similar to what we are having now. The situation we are in now calls for a similar approach by Nigeria. We have to develop a nation; we cannot continue to afford to remain as so many nations within a state. To have a nation we can all call our home, we need justice, equity and fairness.\u201d\n\nThe MBF leader insisted that it would be inelegant for the Yoruba to contest for the position of the president in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut we believe that it is clumsy and inelegant for the South-west to seek the presidency at this time. Not after Obasanjo\u2019s eight years as president and Osinbajo\u2019s eight years as vice president.\n\n\u201cFor us, the debate should be a straight one between the South-south and the South-east. But the South-south has occupied the seat of president for one term and the South-east has never occupied it at all. The north that presently is occupying the number one position in Nigeria and the South-west that has been served should not entertain any thought of throwing their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cAfter your own region has been served a consensus to stabilise the Nigerian polity and give its people a sense of belonging, it would amount to taking the food tray away in a banquet hall after dishing enough food to one\u2019s plate. Of course, others on the queue will be well within their right to chase and deal with such selfish people.\u201dEven out there in the north, there is a division. The insurgents, the killing, the abduction for ransom have opened people\u2019s eyes to know that all is not well. It is only proper that we take this thing to the south and it is the turn of the South-east to produce the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In the last year, about 95 per cent of the estimated 228 million cases occurred in the WHO/AFRO Region, along with 602,020 reported deaths.\n\n\u201cSix of our countries, the worst-impacted by malaria in the region, are reported to have accounted for up to 55 per cent of cases globally, and for 50 per cent of these deaths.\u201d\n\nThe commemoration of World Malaria Day is marked annually to focus global attention on the disease and its devastating impact on families, communities, and societal development, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMoeti said the past year saw significant breakthroughs in malaria prevention and control, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cDespite some slowing of progress to reduce malaria cases and deaths, and the disruptions to health services caused by COVID-19, we are still much further ahead than we were in 2000. We need to reignite that momentum and build on the recent advances.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to reduce the number of people catching and dying from malaria. This requires a focus on research and on leveraging available evidence to ensure that our targeted interventions are an efficient use of resources, which produce measurable results,\u201d she added.\n\nHowever, the United States yesterday disclosed that it spent $768 million from 2011 to date to fight the disease in Nigeria.\n\nPrecisely, in 2021 alone, the United State revealed that it spent $74 million on malaria scourge despite the outbreak of COVID-19 and new demand on combating the global challenge of the pandemic.\n\nA statement yesterday, by US Embassy in Nigeria, stated that the US President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI) had partnered with Nigeria to fight malaria since 2011, contributing $768 million to date and $74 million in full year 2021.\n\nThe PMI\u2019s Annual Report, released yesterday showcased how the strong partnership between the United States and Nigeria enabled robust and effective malaria services to continue in FY 2021, even as COVID-19 caused enormous strain on the health system.\n\nIt added that: \u201cThrough PMI funding and programmes, 58 million bed nets, 130 million fast acting medicines, and 82 million malaria test kits have been delivered to clinics and communities since 2011.\n\n\u201cIn addition, 24 million preventive treatment doses were delivered to pregnant women and 13 million doses to children during the rainy season. In the past year, more than 3,666 health workers received training that amplified their ability to detect and treat malaria, while strengthening the health system overall and providing key skills to fight COVID-19 and future pandemics.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted the USAID Mission Director Anne Patterson to have said: \u201cI think what Nigeria is doing to advance more effective malaria prevention, treatment, and control is so important, especially the introduction of innovative tools to make better use of the data in real-time, and also to enhance quality of care via community-based health workers.\u201d\n\nAssisted by PMI investments, Nigeria is progressing its fight against malaria using proven and cost-effective methods that save lives and promise a healthier and prosperous future for families and communities, according to the statement.\n\nExxonMobil Spent over $37.4m on Anti Malaria Programmes in Nigeria in 20 Years\n\nIn a related development, American oil and gas giant, ExxonMobil, said it invested more than $37.4 million or over N15 billion in Nigeria-based malaria programmes since 2002 through its humanitarian organ, the ExxonMobil Foundation.\n\nIt explained that the fund was spent in cash grants to partners working to develop community-based solutions in Nigeria since 2002.\n\nThe international oil company (IOC) said in the last 20 years, the foundation had embarked on funding community education, providing tools for prevention and treatment of the disease and training of health workers, adding that its 2022 grant recipients focused on leveraging the power of sports to engage Nigerian youth.\n\nThe foundation in collaboration with ExxonMobil affiliate companies in Nigeria, also announced renewed support for partner organisations committed to ending malaria in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, it explained that these grants, among other scheduled activities for World Malaria Day, marked the 20th anniversary of ExxonMobil\u2019s support for programmes to reduce the burden of malaria in Nigeria.\n\nMarking its 20th year of malaria fight in Nigeria and in continuation of this legacy, the oil major has, however, announced its 2022 grant recipients.\n\nThey included PanAfricare, in conjunction with NBA Power Forward, to foster the development of youth in Nigeria through sports, life skills and malaria education; and Grassroot Soccer, to use the convening power of soccer to increase awareness of malaria and HIV/AIDS among young people across Nigeria through sports curriculum.\n\nAnother recipient is Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, aimed to advance scientific knowledge and understanding to advance progress toward the eradication of malaria.\n\n\u201cThis World Malaria Day, we mark ExxonMobil\u2019s contributions over the past two decades that have helped equip and strengthen resilience within our communities to fight against malaria.\n\n\u201cThanks to these efforts, Nigeria is better prepared to continue the progress we have made and work toward a malaria-free future,\u201d Chairman and Managing Director, ExxonMobil affiliate Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Richard Laing, said.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Malaria Initiative works with nonprofit partners and leading global health organizations to advance progress against the disease in malaria-endemic countries by supporting malaria education and awareness, improving access to tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, strengthening health infrastructure and advancing research and innovation.\n\nThe initiative continues to support malaria prevention and control programs in Nigeria, a country which currently accounts for more than one quarter of the global burden of the disease.\n\nIn honor of World Malaria Day, the company said these partners were focused on leveraging the power of sports and media to reach Nigerian youth, through malaria-themed tournaments and creative radio, television and school-based malaria campaigns, among other activities.\n\nObaseki Canvasses Innovative Financing in Anti-malaria Fight\n\nMeanwhile, Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged stakeholders to explore innovative approaches to financing efforts and technologies for the prevention and control of malaria disease so as to realise the global zero malaria target.\n\nThe governor made the call in commemoration of World Malaria Day, yesterday, to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment to malaria prevention and control.\n\nObaseki urged youths to support the global effort to eliminate malaria by developing innovations and technologies for the prevention and treatment of the disease.\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cAs we commemorate this year\u2019s World Malaria Day, we must reinforce efforts and strengthen alliances to reduce the burden of the malaria disease, one of the world\u2019s oldest and deadliest diseases estimated to have claimed over 627, 000 lives in about 85 countries in one year.\n\n\u201cWhile governments across all levels intensify efforts at improving community-focused malaria interventions, especially in hard-to-reach communities, global stakeholders must strive to bridge the funding gap in achieving a future free of malaria by exploring innovative approaches to stimulate investments in the prevention and control of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf the 2030 zero-malaria target must be achieved, we must embrace multi-sectoral collaborations, public-private partnerships and technology-led solutions, leveraging on the innate potential of the youths, to establish a robust malaria control programme, ensuring the prevention, detection and cure of the disease.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who noted that his government had embarked on interventions, including the distribution of treated mosquito nets, advocacy and others to ensure that the people are properly equipped to fight malaria, said the state is revamping its health system to bring quality primary healthcare closer to citizens.\n\nHe noted that his administration had also ramped up the construction of primary healthcare centres at the ward level across the state, ensuring that each centre is equipped with the right manpower and equipment to sustain the campaign against malaria and other infectious diseases.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Buhari mourns over 100 persons killed in Imo explosion, says it\u2019s national disaster *Insists those responsible must be brought to justice *Directs security agencies to clamp down on oil theft\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIIn furtherance of Operation Dakatar Da Barawo (OPDDB) that was launched to checkmate crude oil theft and related acts of economic sabotage, the Nigerian Navy said it seized 6, 000, 000 litres of stolen crude oil estimated at N264 billion.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed \u201cshock and trauma\u201d about the death of over 100 people in an explosion at an illegal oil refinery in Imo State.\n\nHowever, there were no report of seized barges and motherships by the Navy, unfortunately, that is where most of the theft occur because these are the means by which stolen crude oil are being transported to international market and sold at far below the market price. And sadly this is occurring right under the nose of the security agencies some of who the government has acknowledged collude with the the criminals to shortchange the country.\n\nFollowing the alarming increase of crude oil theft, the president had directed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, to ensure that the criminal activity was brought to a halt. Buhari\u2019s directive had followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOwing to the directive, the naval troops disclosed that they recorded more arrests and seizures between April 15th and 23rd, 2022, being the third week of the operation.\n\nA statement issued by Naval Headquarters stated that the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA in Warri, deactivated an Illegal Refining Site (IRS) around Sara creek.\n\nThe IRS had 16 ovens, 16 metal storage tanks and three wide pits filled with about 500,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, as well as 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil, a generator and 4 pumping machines.\n\nAlso, the statement revealed that an IRS at Asugbo creek in Warri was discovered with six ovens, 12 metal storage tanks and five large pits all containing about 600,000 litres of stolen crude oil including 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 150,000 litres of sludge.\n\nSimilarly, sequel to series of air reconnaissance, Forward Operating Base (FOB) FORMOSO in Bayelsa State on April 19, 2022, raided an IRS at Ereweibio creek in Brass LGA.\n\nAccordingly, seven large cooking ovens, 10 large metal storage tanks and drums all laden with about 400,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of suspected illegally refined PMS were discovered.\n\nThe site also had five large pits holding approximately 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil. Equally, two pumping machines, one gasoline generator, one submersible pump and one chainsaw machine were discovered at the site and destroyed in situ.\n\nAccording to the statement, on April 21, 2022, an IRS at Lelemu creek in Warri South-West was discovered. During the operation, 19 ovens, 26 metal storage tanks and two dugout pits laden with about 250,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil and 50,000 litres of illegally refined AGO were destroyed.\n\nTo ensure effective deactivation of IRS, NNS DELTA on 21 April 2022 conducted swamp buggy operations during which an earlier identified IRS around Egwa creek in Warri was destroyed.\n\nDuring the operation, 16 ovens, 31 metal storage tanks and seven large pits all filled with about 850,000 litres of stolen crude oil were equally deactivated.\n\nRelatedly, on 22 April 2022, around Lelemu creek in Warri South West LGA of Delta State, personnel under NNS DELTA again discovered 22 IRS ovens, 12 metallic storage tanks and 5 large pits all containing about 150,000 litres of stolen crude oil.\n\n\u201cAt another IRS off Lelemu creek, 19 ovens, 42 storage tanks and 14 large pits containing about 300,000 litres of stolen crude oil, as well as approximately 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, 100,000 litres of illegally refined DPK and 100,000 litres of suspected crude oil sludge were all destroyed,\u201d it added.\n\nIn a related development, NNS LUGARD at Kogi State in the course of OPDDB discovered an IRS on 22 April 2022, at a location off Akili-Ozizor community of Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State.\n\nDuring the operation, four locally fabricated ovens, seven metal storage tanks, four large pits of which two were for storage of about 48,000 litres of stolen crude oil were all destroyed.\n\nOn the same day, NNS VICTORY in Calabar raided tanker garage along Harbour road in the city and seized a storage tank containing about 45,000 Litres of suspected illegally refined AGO. Also, a tanker laden with 33,000 Litres of suspected locally refined AGO was seized and the owner was arrested. Furthermore, about 58 drums of locally refined AGO were also seized.\n\nAdditionally, NNS SOROH at Yenagoa, on Saturday 23 April 2022 intercepted a wooden boat at Otuokpot Area along Kolo creek.\n\n\u201cThe wooden boat was laden with 60,000Litres of illegally refined AGO together with over 100 sacks of same product. Items on the boat which included one pumping machine, one Yamaha 40HP outboard engine and one locally made boat Anchor with the products were destroyed at Ogbia waterside,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe base also conducted a search on a Market Boat heading for St Nicolas Axis from Akassa area.\n\nAbout 2,500 litres of suspected illegally refined products stored in gallons and sacks were hidden inside the boat. Accordingly, same were evacuated for destruction. Likewise on the same day, personnel under NNS DELTA on patrol around Jones creek in Warri South West LGA raided an IRS and discovered 33 ovens, 42 metal storage tanks and seven wide pits all filled with about 1,200,000 litres of stolen crude oil, 250,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 100,000 litres of sludge.\n\nFurthermore, combing of the area off Jones creek led to the discovery of another IRS with five ovens, two metal storage tanks and eight large pits with about 150,000 litres of sludge. Both IRS off Jones creek with the discovered items and products were destroyed in situ.\n\nThe statement affirmed that over 6,000,000 litres of products valued over N3 billion from oil thieves and economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cThe migration by operators of IRS from the South South geopolitical zone to the South East also come to the fore. \u201cThis development will in no way deter the Nigerian Navy from ensuring zero tolerance for COT, IRS, illegal bunkering and related economic crimes in the Nation\u2019s maritime environment and adjoining territory\u201d, it said.\n\nBuhari Mourns Over 100 Persons Killed in Imo Illegal Refinery Explosion, Says It\u2019s National Disaster\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Mr. Garba Shehu, Buhari, who described the unfortunate incident that occurred in Ohaji/Egbema of Imo State as a, \u201ccatastrophe and a national disaster,\u201d called on the security agencies to intensify their clampdown on oil theft.\n\nMany people were reportedly burnt beyond recognition by the explosion. It was learnt that the police were now looking for the owner of the unlawful refinery.\n\nDozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire.\n\nThe death toll continued to rise as emergency workers went through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) told the British media organisation, BBC Igbo, that the number killed now stood at 109.\n\n\u201cWe learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\u201d Nnaji said.\n\nWhile offering his condolences to the families of the victims, the president demanded that those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice.\n\nIn the statement, titled, \u201cImo \u2018Refinery\u2019 Deaths, a National Disaster,\u201d Buhari urged community leaders and the security personnel in the area to prevent a reoccurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the nation\u2019s armed forces, security and intelligence agencies to intensify the clampdown on illegal refineries following the reported deaths of tens of people Friday night after an illegal refinery exploded at Abaezi forest in the Ohaji-Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cReacting to what he described as a catastrophe and a national disaster, Buhari said responsibility for the loss of lives and property must squarely lie with the sponsors of the illegal refinery, who must all be caught and made to face justice.\n\n\u201cIn conveying the condolences and the full depth and range of the nation\u2019s shock and trauma to the families of the victims, the Ohaji/Egbema community and the government and people of Imo State, the president urged community leaders, the police, and the secret service to never allow the occurrence of the heart-breaking incident in any part of the country again.\u201d\n\nThe damage to fishing and farming in oil-rich communities caused by the oil industry over the decades has led some to find other ways to make money from the oil business. Illegal refining is attractive in some oil-producing communities, as it is seen as somewhat easy to manage, despite efforts to halt the practice.\n\nThe authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened overnight into Saturday, but accidents like this have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.\n\nThere have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria\u2019s official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country, and making the unlawful business very lucrative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Tambuwal: Tell us who the elders are, \u2026we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible\n\n*Saraki: It\u2019s a welcome development, painstaking efforts\n\n*Mohammed commends IBB, says recommendation not an imposition\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauch\n\nThe ripples generated by the consensus report of some northern elders, which endorsed former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Bauchi State governor as the preferred Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) northern presidential candidates, assumed another dimension yesterday after the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), umbrella body for the northern establishment, dissociated itself from the initiative with an effort to correct certain misgivings.\n\nThis is as some of those concerned have also continued to state their own accounts of what happened, while the others, defended and justified the report, authored by Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nWhile, the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who had maintained a rebellious stance since inception, queried who the northern elders commissioned General Ibrahim Babangida were, Saraki, on his part, commended the report, stating it was a thorough and painstaking efforts that ought to be commended by all.\n\nMohammed too commended the former military president and explained that the report was not an imposition.\n\nOn the contrary, a group known as the United Arewa Youth For Justice and Development, has thrown its weight behind the decision of the northern elders over the endorsement of Mohammed and Saraki as northern presidential consensus candidates of the PDP ahead of the 2023, presidential primaries of the party.\n\nHowever, NEF, in a statement by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum was not involved in the process as a body, it further insisted it was not affiliated to any political party or aspirant as it were, adding that the idea to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. It has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief, and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum, in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant, and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum stated that, it has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions, which offend principles of inclusion and fairness, adding that, the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide.\n\nIt further maintained that it remained united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and would play its role as it has always done whenever the circumstances demanded.\n\nTambuwal, speaking with newsmen, queried the report saying, \u201cTell us who are the elders that sat down to come up with that decision? Who are the people that gave advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information.\n\n\u201cI consulted the party leadership across the country especially, the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on. If not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew, why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from GOD and in his mercy, God will give me,\u201d he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe discussed the possibility of agreeing on one candidate within our group to represent us (Initially not even to represent the whole North) and we all agreed based on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cWe started consultations based on that, and the fourth person that joined us is also another presidential aspirant Mohammad Hayatou-deen. In order for people not to perceive that may be we are trying to fight the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we also went to consult him and seek his blessings.\n\n\u201cHe was happy about it but he didn\u2019t show any interest to join us. That was how we continued our consultations. Along the line, we discussed that we really need an elder in the country, who will help us reach our goal amicably in case we may encounter any disagreement along the line within ourselves and we all agreed that we should take the matter to former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in Minna.\n\n\u201cWe explained to him and he immediately agreed. He was very happy. And he promised to do his best to help us achieve our mission. However, we had to at a point tell ourselves the truth. The four of us met in Bauchi State government diplomatic House in Abuja on Wednesday, we looked into the issue from all angles and we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible and we cannot continue the process, everyone should embark on independent struggle, and whosoever GOD gives the ticket to, its ok.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that senator Bukola Saraki will organise a press conference and inform the public about the outcome. Without consulting us, Bukola Saraki on his own sent us message that we need to go to Minna and see Babangida after all that wasn\u2019t part of what we agreed upon in our meeting. I communicated with Governor of Bauchi Bala Mohammed whether he received same message which he did.\n\n\u201cWe went and met Bukola Saraki. But at that point, I made it categorically clear to them that for the sake of GOD, that we didn\u2019t agree on that; our agreement was that consensus candidate isn\u2019t possible, why should we go and suffer that old man again?\n\n\u201cAnd that I will not go to Minna. Why should they be in a hurry. It isn\u2019t something urgent. Reconciliation and consensus arrangement can be achieved even lately on the elections ground on the day of election. Why the hurry? Our initial plan was to expand our consultations and make the consensus candidate even at national level before we realised that it isn\u2019t possible, even in our group let alone be at national level.\n\n\u201cBut they insisted we have to go to Minna and discuss the issue with Babangida. They were so in a hurry. And to our surprise, the consensus they agreed on yielded two candidates, the two of them not even one. That\u2019s an indication something fishy is going on, and I understand that already. Go and ask the three of them. We met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cHow come Babangida and the Northern elders he invited would impose it on us after all we took ourselves to him, and we later withdrew,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyanu, described the report of the consensus as thorough and painstaking in reaching the decision.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent. One needs to commend and appreciate the elders, who worked to actualise the process.\n\n\u201cMay Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on. The process is a work-in-progress.\n\n\u201cOne person will still emerge from the on-going process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMohammed, in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Prof Udenta Udenta, said, \u201cOn Wednesday 20th April, 2022 Gen. Ibrahim Babangida GCFR, through the channel of the platform he inaugurated, announced Senator Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki as the selected Consensus Aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe Senator Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation will thus like to place on record its eternal gratitude to President Ibrahim Babangida, GCFR and the entirety of Northern Elders, who assisted him in reaching this decision.\n\n\u201cOur deep appreciation to them stems less from the fact that Senator Mohammed is among the two selected consensus aspirants and more on their Labour of thankless patriotic duty and uncommon leadership in attempting to bring order and coherence to bear in a condition of acute political uncertainty and fractured political process. We thank you our leaders from the depth of our heart.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached or lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a Consensus Presidential Aspirant. Rather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal. Senator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody, who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the northern elders are scheduled to meet today in Asokoro, Abuja, to deliberate on the consensus report and the Wednesday planned NEC meeting of the PDP,\n\nBut the Arewa Youth, in a press statement by Suleiman Abubakar, the Director, Public Affairs, stated: \u201cAs we embark on the second phase of this critical assignment, the two aspirants chosen by our elders should work together with the support of other major stakeholders and decide on which of them should emerge as the sole consensus PDP northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe criteria used by the elders, revealed that the North-East in terms of zonal assessment have been considered as Governor Bala Mohammed was not the only individual from the zone, hence factors of equity, Justice and fairness should not be ignored in any attempt as we continue on this historic efforts.\n\n\u201cTo this end, with Bala Mohammed as northern consensus candidate, the rest of Nigerians will understand that as northerners, we have done justice to ourselves as Bala is a detribalised leader, who has been tested and trusted as former minister of the federal capital territory, an achiever per excellence as an incumbent governor of Bauchi state.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of readiness demonstrated by his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, since his endorsement by our elders to lead discussion with all other aspirants in the PDP with a view to having a national consensus if possible, is encouraging and this tells us that he is the man for the job, if we truly want to succeed,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters.\nWe met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\nYes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on.\nRather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal.\nSenator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Twitter has accepted Elon Musk\u2019s offer to purchase the company for roughly $44 billion. The social media platform disclosed in a press release today that Musk purchased the company at $54.20 a share, the same price named in his initial offer on April 14, 2022.\n\nBret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s Independent Board Chair, said in the press release that the board had \u201cconducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\u2019s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nWhen Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $219 billion, made his initial offer, Twitter\u2019s board created a poison pill, a defense tactic used by a target company to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover, hinting that it would reject Musk\u2019s offer. News of today\u2019s acceptance shows that the board has changed its stance.\n\nOn April 21, Musk shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he planned to finance the purchase by securing $25.5 billion of debt and about $21 billion equity commitment.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in the statement announcing the acquisition.\n\nHe also hinted at upcoming changes he might implement at the company, adding that he wants to \u201cmake Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact Musk will ultimately have on Twitter, where he\u2019ll start making his proposed changes, or when. He\u2019s recently taken to using the platform to poll users about the creation of an edit button, for example, which Twitter had already been developing at the time. In the initial SEC filing, Musk expressed his plan to take the company private. He also shared during a recent TED interview that he wants to make the Twitter algorithm open-sourced, allowing people around the world to make suggestions and notice changes made to tweets.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s CEO, appeared to support the move, saying in the press release that \u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, Twitter users didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the platform to share their predictions, concerns, and of course, hot takes on the matter.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the new owner of Twitter deal with fake accounts, spam bots and authenticating all human beings of this platform. The hacking of democracy using these digital platforms is another huge problem as well as access by subaltern groups and not just elites pic.twitter.com/KzpY4XMd4s \u2014 Pedzisai Ruhanya (@PedzisaiRuhanya) April 25, 2022\n\n#BREAKING African billionaire, Elon Musk, buys US social media network, Twitter, in bid to help the troubled, disease-ravaged, gun-ridden banana-exporting republic which is struggling to recover from deadly ethnic violence following disputed, shambolic 2020 presidential election. \u2014 gathara (@gathara) April 25, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies hire smart people to help improve how their customers perceive and interact with their products, and Justin Irabor is one of such people. One interesting thing about him is that he has provided value through various channels over the years. If Justin Irabor doesn\u2019t ring a bell, his aliases, Mogwai and TheVunderkind, should.\n\n\u201cI have been many things. It depends on the timeframe I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he begins.\n\nJustin has consistently demonstrated his belief that being exceptional at one thing is not good enough.\n\nIn one of his Substack blog posts, he quoted science fiction author, Robert A Heinlein\u2019s infamous words, \u201cSpecialization is for insects,\u201d not really in praise of self-sufficiency, but rather in the context of mastering one\u2019s craft. Ironically, you would have to move on to the next when that is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin is driven by the philosophy of not being ruled by a scarcity mindset, and it appears that once he has \u201cslain his dragons,\u201d as he puts it, in a particular field, he\u2019s ready for a new exploit.\n\n\u201cLet things go if they are inconvenient for you, more things will come!\u201d\n\nFlipping the pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin describes his career start as \u201ca classical spreadsheet monkey,\u201d working on an eCommerce product as a content executive. Between 2015 and 2021, he was editor-in-chief at a PR company, regional marketing manager for Jumia Food, and head of content and marketing at Hotels.ng.\n\nHe also tried his hands out as the product manager and editor-in-chief for Big Cabal and Zikoko. Later, he took up the opportunity to set up the digital marketing department for Eden Life.\n\nMogwai\u2019s past roles constantly saw him draw upon his superb ability to write convincingly and analyse outcomes and predictions \u2014 skills needed by a marketer and growth specialist. While in these positions, he built confidence and slowly transitioned from the shy person he once was.\n\nIn the past seven years, in contrast to the number of times Justin has granted interviews, he prefers instead to publicise his thoughts through texts and illustrations on different platforms, some of which I was able to track: two Substack blogs \u2014 do while thinking and Craft overflow \u2014 a very active Twitter account, a GitHub repository, a website, and a LinkedIn account.\n\nFun fact: Justin sends between 50 and 80 tweets on a good day. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-blown tweet threads to images with ALT text. If he isn\u2019t talking comics, it\u2019s a show (recently animated series, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, or songs.\n\nJustin is also an artist and illustrator who makes comics to pass the time. Despite all that he does, Mogwai does not let his works alone speak for themselves; he consistently shares his journey. That I got interested in his story is proof that this strategy works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketing, for him, means convincing people and not spending a lot of money while at it.\n\nJustin\u2019s somewhat ironic background saw him having to speak to people despite how shy he was. As a young boy, he gained some sales experience and has grown to work as a digital marketer, content creator, and growth expert.\n\nSpeaking about his experience transitioning across companies and industries, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful; it\u2019s very distressful even. Half the time, you\u2019re gonna be thinking, \u2018Ah! I made a mistake. I should just stay with the thing I\u2019m comfortable in.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nHowever, despite the challenges and doubts about new ventures, he finds that he is fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\nTransitioning to software engineering\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an excerpt from Justin\u2019s LinkedIn bio \u2014 \u201cI come from a background in digital marketing and growth, and that instinct makes me a software engineer who builds products with considerations for the end-user by default.\u201d\n\nI should probably reveal that his transition from digital marketing to software engineering was why I decided to meet Justin.\n\nWe meet at his place. He sits across from me, a table between us, in a sitting room with several strategically placed framed works of art belonging to his flatmate. Donning a pair of grey joggers with a matching T-shirt, he greets me with a warm smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a conversation with Justin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nSoftware engineering called out to him when he was editor-in-chief at a startup, and every downtime had to be escalated to the technical team.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t act on this pull until 2019, when it was clear he needed to change direction. Two years earlier, he thought it was impractical for him to do it along with his job, but he did it nonetheless while still at Eden Life.\n\nA little back story here. By the time Justin had spent four years in marketing and growth, he knew it was time for a change. He was not entirely excited by where his career trajectory might take him \u2014 probably peaking at a C-level executive role and being responsible for a global company\u2019s continental growth.\n\n\u201cMoney is good, but it doesn\u2019t excite me; I am driven by a purely intellectual pursuit. This means that beyond a point, I began to feel like, \u2018Oh! d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I\u2019ve done all of these before.\u2019 Everything is the same thing but in a different context. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The only thing I could do was start to switch industries.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something that felt like when you get on a treadmill; you can\u2019t get off. Once you\u2019re a software engineer, and specifically, computer scientist \u2014 that\u2019s what I wanna be \u2014 your learning is infinite,\u201d he lets out an excited laugh with a lit-up face, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna know some things, but you ain\u2019t gonna know everything till you die.\u201d\n\nI recognise this demeanour anywhere; it could only mean that Mogwai had hit gold and found the perfect escape in software engineering.\n\nIn 2019, Lambda School, a California-based online coding school, opened its doors to students from Africa, and Justin was part of the cohort in that pilot phase. The full-stack developer education programme did not strain his finances since it was a school-now-pay-later arrangement. However, the challenging part was the commitment it required.\n\nJustin describes his daily regimen.\n\n\u201cFor 11 months at a go, every single day, I was writing code. Every single day, I was building a project. This was how I worked it. I attended classes from 8 to 10 a.m. before going to work at Eden till evening.\u201d\n\nOne of the most significant sacrifices he made was putting in extra hours at work to make up for time lost in the mornings. He\u2019d get home in the evenings and take a nap before waking up at 10 p.m. to work on meeting his learning expectation \u2014 to build products after every class.\n\nThe sacrifices paid off, and he\u2019s worked for two foreign companies in under two years.\n\n\u201cI graduated, and I got a job working for a designing agency in the UK called Series Eight. Did a few months there, and then I got a job at a fintech company in Belgrade, Serbia. I\u2019m a full-stack engineer there. So, I work on the backend APIs and customer-facing administrative data board.\u201d\n\nA year as a software engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nAlthough Justin was sure about transitioning into software engineering, he didn\u2019t escape the frustration that came with the move.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I finished Lambda School, it was difficult to get a job as a software engineer.\u201d\n\nHe speaks about a period when he did not have a job. It lasted much longer than he thought and gradually depleted his savings. It took a lot of self-restraint not to pick up a marketing role or accept an offer from a Nigerian company \u2014 which he had initially decided against for some reasons.\n\nBut, in the face of challenges, he spurred himself on by repeatedly asking, \u201cHow badly do I want it?\u201d\n\nHis current job is at TradeCore, a fintech API company, where he\u2019s the only full-stack engineer on the team. He considers his craft as something very intellectually satisfying.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m building, I\u2019m nourished by the things I learn.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the appeal he gets from computer science is how difficult it can get sometimes.\n\nHe takes his time simplifying what programming is to me, but I can\u2019t deny it will take more convincing to agree that it is not more complex than he\u2019s making it. He can probably guess that from my look but still encourages me to try it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s not as difficult as people tend to think because you only have to understand the context. Programming is the purest expression of creativity which means if you\u2019re a creative, you should want to be a programmer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Justin\u2019s new obsession is all over his public-facing platforms.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, I have interest in Web3. So, I do a bunch of Web3 projects; I work on a bunch of DAOs, and I do some dev relations for Web3 products.\u201d\n\nJustin carries himself with the air of a seasoned software engineer, and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he has been in the space for longer. He attributes this to many things he picked up while working in marketing. It is safe to say that he\u2019s proud of his growth.\n\n\u201cI manage myself. I come into meetings and ask questions like I\u2019m a senior engineer. I take responsibility. I learnt that working in the hospitality space.\u201d\n\nMaking Justin proud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nJustin takes pride in being a voracious learner choosing to expose himself \u201cto the trauma of ignorance every day.\u201d Once he discovers a problem, he finds a fix by getting books and tutorials.\n\nAnother smart move is documenting his journey to get a graph of his progress.\n\n\u201cI have something called \u2018Thinkboy\u2019, a note archive which is only for software engineering stuff. I create a folder for the month. I\u2019ve archived the one for 2021.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s committed to building apps even if they don\u2019t get deployed.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of how an average day looks for him. He wakes up at 9:05 a.m., has a stand-up meeting at 10 a.m. to share progress on the previous day\u2019s tasks, and plans for the day. He typically spends the rest of the day on peer programming, debugging, responding to emails, writing code, and making deployments.\n\nHaving recorded a few high and low points, Justin considers Angels Among Us \u2014 a project he worked on during the lockdown in 2020 \u2014 as his proudest achievement. Angels Among Us was deployed a month before he graduated from Lambda School. He describes it as an app for people with relatively secure financial statuses to help a randomly-generated list of people who have been economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn a short time, it attracted several donations and volunteers to put smiles on the faces of several families after raising around \u20a64 million (~$10,000). And, of course, it was only a matter of time before it got the attention of international press platforms like Quartz and Reuters.\n\nDespite the stress that came with it, Justin accomplished his goal of making something purely altruistic. And he plans to do more of such.\n\nAlthough he can\u2019t put a number to the projects he\u2019s built, his most recent is Catalogue, a free NFT minting tool for people with no basic NFT knowledge. He also built Astrofy, an app that generates a horoscope-based Spotify playlist. There are also close to ten other software projects, one of which was runner-up at the BuyCoin fintech Hackathon.\n\nIf things go according to Justin\u2019s plans, he will build a startup in the next three to five years. But if that does not happen, he has the vision to improve on Angels Among Us and create a verifiable database of people who need help across Africa.\n\nIf it does take off, it will create a consistent help channel for people who need it. Say, an amount dedicated to a child\u2019s schooling annually. For him, this would have a long-term impact and cause a dent in the continent\u2019s institutional poverty.\n\nIf Justin is not working, he\u2019s illustrating. In a different life, he would be a filmmaker. If Justin could speak to the whole world at once, he\u2019d say, \u201cYou should be more willing to interrogate established wisdom.\u201d\n\nFun fact: There\u2019s a story for one of Justin\u2019s aliases, Mogwai. A quick Google search tells you it means \u201cevil spirit\u201d or \u201cdevil\u201d in Cantonese. Weird, yes? But Justin says his choice of Mogwai is to remind him to always take responsibility if he wants the best results. Side note: Mogwai used to be a cute pet.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know Elon Musk, the richest man in the world \u2014 according to Forbes \u2014 founded, co-founded, or currently leads Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Tesla Inc., and PayPal?\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019m curious why he, a frequent Twitter user, would wake up one morning and say to himself, \u201cI want to acquire Twitter.\u201d\n\nI was kidding. Maybe he didn\u2019t just wake up and say all of that. \ud83d\ude06 Remember when Musk wanted to launch a social media platform where users could write whatever they wanted? Some people did not want that but asked him to purchase Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, one of the reasons he wanted to buy the platform is that he believes Twitter needs to go private to grow and become a genuine free speech platform.\n\nAlso, he stated that he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, such as lowering the price and banning advertising and adding Dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nInterestingly, it appears he began considering the idea in 2017 when he declared his love for Twitter in a tweet. A Twitterer replying asked him to buy it, and Musk enquired about the price.\n\nWell, before we go to today\u2019s gist, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nElon Musk takes over Twitter\n\nVerifying credentials through blockchain\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions. Do you have a Web-based solution for Africa? Register for TABS Web3 Hackathon here.\n\nAlso, you can register for the event here.\n\nElon Musk takes over Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Twitter-Musk drama, which began with Tesla CEO, Elon Musk purchasing a 9.2 percent stake in Twitter, has seemingly ended.\n\nWhy? Twitter announced yesterday, April 25, 2022, that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Musk for $54.20 per share in cash in an approximately $44 billion transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, Twitter will become a privately held company after the transaction is completed.\n\nRecall that Twitter initially implemented a poison pill strategy that could thwart a takeover attempt by making it too expensive.\n\nRemember this? Who will take the poison pill? It appears Twitter has literally swallowed its poison pill by negotiating with Musk.\n\nPer The New York Times, Musk met with Twitter\u2019s board of directors in the early hours of Monday, April 25, 2022, to discuss his unsolicited bid to purchase the company.\n\nBut why\u2019d Twitter accept Musk\u2019s offer even with the poison pill in place? Unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, depending on who you ask \u2014 the company was under intense pressure from its shareholders to reach an agreement with Musk.\n\nThe Twitter board reportedly met on Sunday, April 24, 2022, to discuss Musk\u2019s offer after outlining a detailed financing plan for his bid on Thursday, April 21, 2022. The financing plan is believed to have changed the board\u2019s perception of Musk\u2019s $54.20 per share offer.\n\nRecall that Musk stated in a tweet that if his bid is successful, he will defeat spambots and authenticate all real humans.\n\nWill you continue to use the app now that the bid appears to be a done deal, even as we wait for the new Twitter owner to fulfill his promises? Please leave your comment in the comments section.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nVerifying credentials through blockchain\n\nFake credentials have become a worldwide issue. Per the National Student Clearinghouse, a US NGO that provides a degree verification service, falsified academic credentials are a serious, prevalent, and ever-increasing problem.\n\nThere is also a growing concern in Africa about the proliferation of low-quality \u2014 if not entirely bogus \u2014 universities and colleges. For example, in Benin, a West African country, some unscrupulous Benin-based operators are preying on gullible Nigerians by offering them fake degrees, resulting in fake credentials.\n\nIn South Africa, the use of forged credentials is becoming more common. The number of fraudulent qualifications reported to regulatory bodies like the South African Qualifications Authority increased significantly in 2018.\n\nSo, to reduce the occurrences of fraud and fake documentation, South Africa believes that blockchain is the way forward. Consequently, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) announced that it would begin issuing blockchain-based certificates to students who graduate from the institute this year.\n\nWhat does this imply? UJ is leading the way in South African education by issuing degrees and other certifications that can be verified using blockchain technology.\n\nWhy? The authenticity of blockchain-based certificates makes certificate fraud virtually impossible, but it also allows anyone to check its authenticity by simply scanning a QR code printed on the certificate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the new blockchain-based certificates will not only protect the university\u2019s certificates from fraud but will also protect the institution\u2019s reputation and qualification integrity.\n\nWhile you\u2019re wondering how this would work, I believe you can guess what I will do next. Haha! I\u2019m not a blockchain enthusiast like Bolu. If this is your first or second time reading Techpoint Digest, Techpoint Africa\u2019s newsletter, I believe you should meet Bolu, our blockchain go-to person.\n\nBolu provided some interesting insights in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast. Please take a moment to listen to it here.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re still unsure about the blockchain concept or want to make a career out of it and don\u2019t know how to begin, I believe the Tecpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is for you.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a new week, and we are back with Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast. Top on our list \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 is the Twitter sale.\n\nYesterday, April 25, 2022, Twitter\u2019s board of directors announced that it had agreed to be acquired by an entity owned by Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, at approximately $44 billion. If you\u2019ve been following this closely, then you also know that this means the microblogging platform is going private.\n\nI\u2019m not a capital markets expert, so I can\u2019t tell you if it was a good idea to hodl or not, but it seems all shareholders are getting money to the tune of $54.20 per share. Not a bad return, considering the price hovered around $50 to $52 until trading on Twitter stock was stopped due to the impending sale. Some interesting takes there.\n\nMoving on, after Emmanuel\u2019s journey to the launch site of Google\u2019s Equiano Internet cable, it turns out it isn\u2019t landing until Friday, April 29, 2022.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs blockchain technology gains more popularity across Africa, Bekonta is raising awareness for more crypto user education in Nigeria. This is geared toward helping Nigerians understand the blockchain ecosystem so that they can position themselves to benefit from this wealth transfer era.\n\nThrough their automated platform, Nigerians can buy tokens like Ethereum, BNB, USDT, BUSD, Tron, etc, that grant them access to explore the crypto world and create wealth for themselves.\n\nThe Need for Blockchain User Education\n\nBekonta hopes that raising awareness about educating users on blockchain technology will accelerate crypto adoption as African entrepreneurs keep developing solutions and creating more use cases for cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, the Nigerian Fintech startup is working towards creating an ecosystem that ushers Nigerians into a world where crypto plays a significant role in their everyday lives.\n\nFor instance, through the Bekonta app, Nigerians can easily pay for utilities like electricity bills, TV subscriptions, even topping up their airtime, and more.\n\nA major part of the success of crypto adoption in Nigeria has been due to user education \u2013 people who understand how it works took advantage of what this new technology had to offer.\n\nThe Nigerian crypto space may not be at its peak right now as there are still a lot of people around who are unfamiliar with digital currencies but Bekonta hopes to change that soon.\n\nA survey by Luno found that 55% of Nigerians do not know crypto, while South Africa and Kenya recorded 56% and 64% respectively.\n\nA major barrier preventing people from exploring the crypto space was a lack of knowledge about the blockchain. A Coinbase survey also showed that many people have expressed a strong desire to begin learning about new and different crypto assets beyond Bitcoin, but didn\u2019t know where to begin.\n\nNow, we see celebrities, artists, and influencers launching their NFTs as these tokens provide more use cases for their communities to get into the crypto world. In as much as crypto adoption in Africa is in its infancy, the more these blockchain conversations are triggered across sectors, the more we see new use cases for crypto here in Africa.\n\nSo Bekonta encourages other Nigerian crypto companies not to only educate their users about the benefits of owning and investing in cryptocurrency, but also to share more about the use cases and real-world applications of blockchain technology, so users can see firsthand how crypto can be beneficial to their daily lives.\n\nBekonta co-founder, Seth Reuben explained, \u201cBlockchain technology is evolving at a fast pace. Hence, it is important to bridge the knowledge gap for the average Nigerian youth so they can tap into the various career and investment opportunities this sector brings.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Crypto has come to stay and we hope soon enough, everybody will get involved.\u201d\n\nHow User Education Will Improve User Safety\n\nWith the acceleration of crypto adoption, crypto scams are also on the rise. Many fake platforms are out there to swindle people\u2019s funds. So, users must stay informed about these phishing scams to protect their wallets.\n\nHere are some safety tips for crypto users to keep their accounts safe:\n\nDon\u2019t use the same password for your crypto-enabled accounts. Properly verify any link you see on the web before you click. Turn on 2-Factor authentication on your devices and accounts.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the blockchain industry provides opportunities for Africans to escape poverty, there is a need for more people to understand what blockchain entails, why it is important, and how they can make use of it to improve their lives.\n\nUser education will play a crucial role in helping mainstream crypto adoption in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey? Sign up for bekonta now and enjoy the cheapest rates when you buy BTC, USDT, BNB, ETH, TRX, and more!\n\nAbout Bekonta\n\n\n\nBekonta is an automated platform that enables you to Buy, Sell or Store your Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), and More securely. We encourage more Nigerians to learn more about the blockchain space and get involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says he does not owe allegiance to anybody outside his oath of office and therefore does not see any reason why he should not run for the office of president of Nigeria in the 2023 elections.\n\nOsibanjo made the declaration on Tuesday while consulting with the people and government of Ogun, his home state.\n\nThe vice-president\u2019s position comes amid insinuations in some quarters that his declaration to contest for the presidency is tantamount to \u2018betrayal\u2019 of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State in whose government Osinbajo served as attorney-general and commissioner for justice (1999-2007).\n\nTinubu had earlier declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 election on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), the same party as the VP, saying it has been his life-long ambition. Critics of Osinbajo say he should have buried his ambition and supported Tinubu whom they referred to as his former \u2018boss.\u2019\n\nSpeaking at a meeting involving the governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodu, traditional rulers, and other stakeholders, the VP declared: \u201cAfter all I have learnt, so if I am called upon to serve the nation, should I say no? I have decided that I will run for the office. I have sworn an oath to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is an oath to our people, our children and the future of Nigeria. I owe nobody else any allegiance outside the oath.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said he was not in the state to campaign, but to inform his people of his intention to run for the office of the president.\n\nRead also: FG reassures manufacturers of measures to cushion effect of high production costs\n\nHe explained that he has consulted widely, including with President Muhammadu Buhari before deciding to go into the contest to succeed his boss.\n\nRecounting his contributions to the present Federal Government, Osinbajo said he was actively involved in the judiciary reforms and its repositioning to work optimally and ensure that judges are adequately enumerated.\n\nHe said working with President Buhari has exposed him to governance at the highest level and placed him in a position to tackle serious issues concerning the economy, security, among others.\n\n\u201cThe vice-president position is an opportunity to serve and I have served with utmost loyalty. I put everything into my work. I am a candidate who will hit the ground running when I am elected.\n\n\u201cI have the requisite knowledge to do the job and build on what others have put in place. My presidency will bring peace, unity and development to the country.\n\nGovernor Abiodun said the state would support the presidential ambition of Osinbajo to enable him \u201ccontinue with the laudable projects of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\u201d\n\nAt the stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at the Akarigbo Palace in Sagamu, the Alake Palace in Abeokuta and the Presidential Lodge, Ibara, Abeokuta, as well as the Palace of Olu of Ilaro and paramount ruler of Yewaland, Governor Abiodun said Osinbajo in the last seven years, has contributed to the many successes recorded by the Federal Government, noting \u201che is eminently qualified to lead the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cYour steadfastness, integrity, and character are all well-known. You are serving this country and the president meritoriously for the last seven years as the vice-president. We have no doubt that you will do well as the president and we will support you\u201d, Abiodun told Osinbajo.\n\nThe paramount ruler of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, also speaking said the vice-president was competent with the required qualification to lead the nation, observing that his performance as the acting president is there for all to see.\n\nAlake of Egbaland, Adedotun Gbadebo, also attested to the competence of Osinbajo, saying \u201cthe vice-president has paid his dues and is eminently qualified to succeed as president.\n\n\u201cI want to pray that you will come back to this Palace as a president and Nigeria will gain tremendously under your watch.\u201d",

In terms of recovery, as you are aware, small businesses were impacted by COVID-19, when funding from DBN was even more required to be able to support small businesses; and that\u2019s what we saw happening in 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur cumulative disbursement of N482Billion especially to women-owned or managed businesses; is something that we are particularly delighted about from the perspective of women empowerment and poverty alleviation,\u201d the MD emphasised.\n\nWhile presenting the summary of the financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2021, to the shareholders, the Okpanachi informed that the bank\u2019s gross earnings closed at N38.18 billion, profit before tax (PBT) at N22.76 billion representing, an increase of 25 percent from the previous year; while total assets also increased by 1.4 percent from N492.3 billion in 2020 to N499.2 billion in 2021.\n\nThe MD attributed the bank\u2019s financial performance to \u201cits robust corporate governance framework, business model as well as its top-notch enterprise risk management coupled with highly committed board of directors, management and staff. This is something that I am very proud of.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe continued to focus and deliver on our mandate of providing access to finance through our PFIs to Nigeria\u2019s most critical, but underserved micro, small, and medium scale enterprises building their capacity and that of the PFIs in addition to the provision of partial credit guarantee to encourage lending to this very important sub-sector of the economy\u201d.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the bank\u2019s shareholders, development partners, PFIs, board of directors, and employees for their continued support with a promise to continue to remain focused on the bank\u2019s mandate as well as sustain efforts toward achieving sustainable financing and capacity building for the MSMEs.\n\nOn loan recovery, Okpanachi informed that the bank currently do not have non-performing loans(NPLs), and all financial institutions have been able to meet their obligation.\n\n\u201cToday, we have zero non-performing loans (NPLs), all our portfolios are performing. We are a wholesale institution, so our direct customers are the financial institutions. Financial institutions also do their credit appraisal, they take the credit risk and lend to MSMEs that they are sure will be able to repay,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the NPL, that is industry level, it is still below the 5 percent from reports we see from the central bank. So by and large, the lending to these MSMEs has not been negatively impacted in terms of NPL,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further on the bank\u2019s future plans, the CEO informed that DBN will continue to deepen relationships, and expand channels of disbursement to more financial institutions and also extend lending to start-ups.\n\n\u201cYou know we make our own lending through commercial banks, microfinance banks, mortgage banks and other financial institutions, so we are expanding that, we are bringing in more financial institutions on board to able to use them as channels to disburse funds.",

Although from his body language, one can see that Jonathan is interested. However, his backers in the APC are confused about how to launder the public image of Jonathan whom they painted incompetent and clueless in 2015.\n\n\u201cAnother tough task the party may face is how it will convince other aspirants like Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Umahi and Bello to step down. Many members are not happy with the plot and are ready to shoot it down.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Leader, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, Ekiti State, Femi Adeleye, said on Sunday that the party could not give Jonathan a waiver to contest the presidential election as a consensus candidate when there were competent and capable aspirants already.\n\nAdeleye who said the presidential aspirants were already preparing for an indirect primary, however, said the party would adopt Osinbajo in case it considered a consensus arrangement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEven at that, if all the contestants agree within themselves and decide to step down for one of them, I am very comfortable that our principal, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will be the one they will step down for. I am very comfortable with that.\n\n\u201cIf some people are rooting for Jonathan, the party must accept him first. And for him to contest, he must have spent a year in the party and our primary will hold in the one month\u2019s time. It will be very difficult for the party to say they want to give him a waiver and pick him as consensus candidate when there are competent hands already on the ground.\u201d\n\nIn a swift response, the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 known as SWAGA 2023, said that there was no possibility of a consensus presidential candidate in the upcoming primary election.\n\nThe Chairman of SWAGA 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, said, \u201cThe candidates for the presidential election await the primaries and the people will have to earn it. Don\u2019t forget that under the new electoral law, you can only have consensus when all the candidates or aspirants have agreed in writing and I don\u2019t see that happening. Those who are looking for consensus are the lazy ones who have not done any work.\n\n\u201cWe are working and hoping to have free and fair primaries which I know that by the grace of the almighty God, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will easily win. So, the issue of consensus candidacy should be forgotten completely. Nobody will impose the president on Nigeria, the party members will choose their candidates by themselves at the convention and the Nigerian people will be given the opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice in February next year.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye said the Presidential primary would not be like the national convention of March 26 because the primary is more complicated as it would involve a wider electorate.\n\nThe leader of the Grassroot Network for Asiwaju Tinubu group, Mr Abiodun Mafe, also said that Jonathan was not known to be a member of the APC hence he could not be the presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cJonathan has never been a member of the APC, so how will it be possible for anyone to say that he will be made a consensus candidate? Until he now proves to the whole world that he is a card-carrying member of the APC, it can\u2019t be. Even at that, there is a process. Constitutionally, anybody who is a member of the APC has the right to contest but as far as I am concerned Jonathan is not a part,\u201d Mafe stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The exercise was earlier called off due to some logistical bottlenecks.\n\nConsequently, nomination forms for aspirants vying for the House of Assembly would be sold at the various state secretariats of the party nationwide while forms for other positions such as the House of Representatives, Senate, governorship and Presidency would be sold at the national secretariat, Abuja.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, said the decision to close the country\u2019s land borders achieved results in terms improving food production.\n\nBuhari had ordered the closure of the country\u2019s land borders in August 2019 to crack down on smuggling.\n\nFour of the borders were reopened in 2020 including the Seme border in South West, Maigatari and Ilela borders in North West and Mfun borders in South-South.\n\nFour more were ordered reopened by the President last week including Idiroko in Ogun, Jibiya in Katsina, Kamba in Kebbi and Ikom in Cross River.\n\nSpeaking during an audience with the African Development Bank (AfDB) President, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, President Buhari suggested that the decision to close borders helped to improve food production in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are very much aware of the need for food security, and to encourage our local farmers, that was why we closed our borders for about two years to curb smuggling. We made some progress,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe AfDB president had briefed him on steps being taken by the bank to avert food crisis in Africa, in the foreseeable future.\n\nBuhari praised AfDB for planning ahead of whatever negative consequences may come from the Russia-Ukraine war in terms of food security.\n\nAdesina said that the Russia-Ukraine war would create global problems, and particularly for Africa, which imports a huge percentage of its food from the two countries.\n\n\u201cAlready, the price of wheat has gone up about 60 per cent. Maize and other grains will also be affected. There may be fertiliser crisis, as there would be about 2 million metric tons deficit. And that will affect food production by about 20%. Africa will lose $11 billion worth of food, and coming shortly after COVID-19, that would be rather serious,\u201d the AfDB President disclosed.\n\nTo prepare against the evil day, Dr Adesina said the AfDB has developed a $1.5 billion Africa Emergency Food Plan, which is now before the bank\u2019s Board for approval.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were not ready for COVID-19, but we are now planning to avert food crisis on the continent. There is plan to help farmers cultivate wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, and soybeans. It will mitigate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war.\u201d\n\nTalking specifically of Nigeria, the Nigerian-born Adesina, and a former Minister of Agriculture, said in the wet season of 2022, at least 5 million smallholder farmers would be helped to cultivate 1 million hectares of maize, 1 million hectares of rice, and 250,000 hectares of sorghum and soybeans, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn total, our support will help Nigeria to produce 9.5 million metric tons of food.\u201d\n\nStates that will benefit from the assistance include Kano, Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna, Imo, Cross River, and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nDr Adesina submitted: \u201cMr President, you have a passion for agriculture. We are behind you strongly, and we want to ensure Nigeria won\u2019t feel the impact of the food crisis.\u201d",

Eteng. E. Eteng, who read the resolutions of the aggrieved party, said, \u201cDespite our excitement, enthusiasm, and open arms following our expectations, our spirit have been dampened due to current trend of events.\n\n\u201cWe have not been considered for party positions nor benefits from the wards, local government chapters, states and National level of our party.\u201d\n\nAlso, in an interview with LEADERSHIP in Calabar, convener of the meeting/former chairman of Odukpani LGA in the State, Barr.

          "text": "Some chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State under the auspices of \u2018Legacy and Foundational Members\u2019 have berated the State governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, and the State party chairman, Alphonsus Ogar Esq., over what they described as sidelining of old party members in favour of new entrants.\n\nThe group called on the governor to carry old APC members along in the scheme of things rather than excluding them them from appointments, even when they were the ones who suffered over the years to keep the party together before Ayade defected to APC alongside his supporters.\n\nAt an extraordinary meeting convened by the group held in Calabar on Tuesday, a chieftain of the party, Barr. Eteng. E. Eteng, who read the resolutions of the aggrieved party, said, \u201cDespite our excitement, enthusiasm, and open arms following our expectations, our spirit have been dampened due to current trend of events.\n\n\u201cWe have not been considered for party positions nor benefits from the wards, local government chapters, states and National level of our party.\u201d\n\nAlso, in an interview with LEADERSHIP in Calabar, convener of the meeting/former chairman of Odukpani LGA in the State, Barr. Ekpo Nsa, lamented how old party members, who toiled to keep APC together until Governor Ayade defected to the party, have been marginalised, calling on the state governor to correct the anomaly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his words, Ekpo-Nsa said, \u201cWe have been relegated and excluded in the schemes and politics of the party. We have been treated with contempt and we feel it\u2019s time for our dear governor and party Exco to be aware of our grievance as we prepare for the forthcoming 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cOur party the APC performed poorly in the just-concluded Akpabuyo, Ogoja/Yala federal constituency by-elections. Because we lack grassroot support from our members at the grassroot and internal party inclusiveness and cohesion is not there.\n\n\u201cFrom the existing party register, those who recently defected to APC constitute about 10% of registered APC members in Cross River State.\n\n\u201cThe neglect and exclusion of legacy and foundational members from the affairs of the party would portend serious danger of failure to the party as evident in the last by-elections in the state.\n\n\u201c100% of key positions of the party from ward to national levels are occupied by only those who defected to the party with His Excellency, the state governor.\n\n\u201cWhere is the justice and equity In this situation, where those who built a house, made it attractive with painful labour and financial burden have been wantonly removed from same house?\u201d\n\nThe resolutions signed by 11 members of APC Legacy group urged the state governor, Prof. Ayade to initiate a meeting whereby dialogue can be explored to address the grievances of the group for proper positioning of the party ahead of 2023 elections.\n\nOther demands made by the group include appointments to fill existing vacancies at state Exco as well as vacancies resulting from resignation of those who intend to contest primaries and elections in the forthcoming party primaries and 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cEqual ratio and support should be given to Legacy and Foundational members to contest in the forthcoming elections with those who defected recently with the governor,\u201d the resolution maintained.\n\nAmong other issues agitated for by the group were awarding of atleast 50% of elective offices available in the state to legacy and foundational members in the 2023 general elections.",

          "title": "Met Police Officer In Trouble For Participating In Nigeria\u2019s Reality TV Show",
          "text": "A Metropolitan Police officer is currently facing a misconduct hearing after appearing on a Nigeria\u2019s reality TV show, BigBrother Naija in 2019, without gaining prior permission from her employer.\n\nPC Khafilat Kareem is currently answering allegations that her conduct amounts to a breach of the Met\u2019s Standards of Professional Behaviour after defying bosses who rejected her request to appear on the show.\n\nThe five-day hearing that started on Monday and is due to close on Friday comes two-and-a-half years after the officer went on leave to travel to Nigeria where she participated in the reality TV programme.\n\nIn a press statement the Met said that although the officer had been given permission to go on leave, permission to participate on the show was not granted.\n\nThe Met said: \u201cIn June 2019 PC Kareem left the UK and without permission took her work laptop with her. In July 2019 PC Kareem began participation on the TV show and surrendered her work laptop to the show\u2019s organisers.\n\n\u201cAfter returning to the UK, PC Kareem failed to declare a business interest in relation to publicity and promotion of the TV show. It is alleged that PC Kareem\u2019s conduct has breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour in respect of, Orders & Instructions and Discreditable Conduct.\u201d\n\nAccording to a BBC report, the officer, who has over 1.4m followers on Instagram, had texted and called Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist, one of the Met\u2019s most senior officers, and asked him to reverse the order just hours before she appeared on the show \u201cwithout authority\u201d. She lasted 77 days before being evicted from the Big Brother house.\n\nOn the first day of the hearing at the Empress Building in West London on Monday, PC Kareem also admitted to surrendering her work laptop to the show\u2019s organisers, but she denied allegations of breaching standards in respect of \u201corders and instructions\u201d and \u201cdiscreditable conduct\u201d, the BBC reported. The officer also denied an allegation that she failed to declare a business interest in relation to publicity and promotion of the TV show.\n\nSpeaking at the tribunal, Anne Studd QC reportedly said: \u201cHaving seen the UK episodes of the show, concerns were raised. But, PC Kareem said Naija (Nigerian Big Brother) was not like the UK version. She saw it as a chance to promote the Met on an international basis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLooking at the website and information provided, Ch Supt Jason Gwillim concluded it was not in the best interests of the Met or the officer and it would put her in a compromising situation. He explained the rationale and stressed she was not to take part in the show.\n\n\u201cGwillim\u2019s impression was that PC Kareem was disappointed but understood. She took the period of unpaid leave.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the tribunal, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said he had \u201cnever been faced with these circumstances before\u201d and felt it was \u201cmost unusual\u201d a PC was contacting someone of his rank on a weekend.\n\nHe said: \u201cI got the impression she was phoning hoping I would change the decision. I got the fact she was in Nigeria. I got the strong sense she was going to do it, but she did not say as much.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI was worried about her mental health, we have no ability to support or intervene in the Big Brother house. We had no idea what security was in place around the Big Brother house and something awful could happen there or she could be targeted as a serving constable.\n\n\u201cOver the years a number of people who come out of the Big Brother house are reported in the media to have suffered mental health issues. Knowing the UK version, this is something we wouldn\u2019t want a serving officer appearing on.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal later heard that PC Kareem went to see a psychologist after the show following her eviction from the Big Brother house due to the \u201cadverse\u201d media attention she had received afterwards. The tribunal is ongoing.",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has raised the alarm over alleged plot by some criminal elements to bomb worship and recreational centres as well as return the country to pre-2015 general elections during and after Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nThe Service in a press release by the Public Relations Office, Dr Peter Afunanya, titled: Public Alert on Renewed Bomb Explosions, Tuesday in Abuja, said: \u201cThe DSS hereby draws public attention to plans by criminal elements to return the country to the pre-2015 era reminiscent of IED attacks on soft and hard targets in parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThough there are already reported cases of such incidents in some areas, the Service has uncovered a ploy by suspected criminal gangs to forge an alliance among themselves with a view to launching further attacks on critical infrastructure and other frequented public places like worship and relaxation centres, especially during and after the holidays and festive celebrations.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to achieve some self- serving interests as well as cause fear among the citizenry. The Service, however, recalls its earlier warning that some groups and individuals were plotting to stoke violence in the country.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson further said: \u201cFollowing these, patrons, owners and managers of aforementioned public places are advised to be wary of this development and implement basic security measures to deter the threats. While the Service is committed to the disruption of this trend and pattern of violent attacks, it will continue to partner with other security agencies to ensure that necessary drills are emplaced in order that public peace and order are not jeopardised.\n\n\u201cTo this end, residents are enjoined to go about their lawful businesses and share, with security and law enforcement agencies, useful information on the activities of criminals.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cThe DSS Director General (DGSS), Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi, wishes all and sundry a hitch free Workers\u2019 Day and Sallah celebrations.\u201d\n\nBandits strike\n\nIn a related development, bandits Monday night stormed a community killing the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman of Aribi Ward, Kagarko local government area of Kaduna state, Mr Iliya Auta and injured one other person in his company.\n\nThe bandits also shot to death a farmer simply called Tanko in Kuchi village and injured another person, while they made away with eight motorcycles and several cattle after attacking various communities in Kagarko local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThough, Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige and Kaduna state government have yet to confirm the incident, a competent source from the community, who did not want his name mentioned, said the APC chairman was killed on his farm while another person with him was shot, and receiving treatment at a hospital in Kagarko town.\n\nAccording to the source, Iliya was not the target of the bandits who were apparently on a mission when they saw him on his farm making a call beside his car, a move they mistook that he was calling to report their presence, hence he was shot to death as a result.\n\nThe source said, \u201cthe APC Ward Chairman went to his farm and after close of work on his farm, he was about going back home but his car developed an electrical fault and he was trying to call an electrician to help come and fix it not knowing that the bandits were behind him.\n\n\u201cThe bandits thought he was calling the villagers to report their presence, that was how they shot him and he died instantly and the other person with him also sustained bullet shot and receiving treatment at Kagarko hospital now.\n\n\u201cOne other person by name Tanko was killed in another village called Kuchi and another person sustained injury and in critical condition in the hospital. The bandits also made away with eight motorcycles and several cattle but to the best of my knowledge, there was no kidnap of persons.\u201d\n\nAnother source however said unconfirmed number of persons were abducted after the attacks that took place Monday night within and around communities in Kagarko local government area.\n\nCSO on foreign support\n\nMeanwhile, a Civil Society Organisation, Integrity Advocacy for Development Initiative and Centre for Peace and Transparency and Accountability,\n\nhas called on the federal government \u201cto seek functional foreign partnership especially in the area of improved crime detection, crime arrest management technology & hardware.\u201d\n\nThe CSO also advised \u201cfor the improvement of human resource expertise of the Nigerian military, police and the paramilitary agencies.\u201d\n\nAt a state-of-the-nation press conference addressed Tuesday by the leader, Comrade Patrick Ogheneyero, the group said \u201cthe use of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme to support the military and law enforcement structures of Nigeria is another worthy consideration.\u201d\n\nThe group also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to continue to engage the governors, the Council of State, civil society groups in all communities within the 774 LGs, religious and traditional rulers, the media and other sundry critical stakeholders via Town Hall meetings as a means of achieving autonomy for local governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is noteworthy to applaud the good intentions of President Muhammadu Buhari towards the achievement of autonomous local government in Nigeria, especially, the creation of NFIU-Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit which is birthed to ensure direct funding of local governments from the federation account with the primary intention to improve the economic capacity of Local Governments to steer change in the grassroots which inadvertently would only consequent to economic development of Nigeria in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the lack of cooperation by governors for reasons of easier administration of LGs as the governors claim, but we sympathize with the intention of the President.\n\n\u201cIt is in the best interest of the Nigerian people and so we admonish him to continue engaging the governors, the Council of State, Civil Society groups in all communities within the 774 LGs, religious and traditional rulers, the media and other sundry critical stakeholders within the Nigerian space via Town Hall meetings,\u201d they further said.\n\nHe said,\u201dcommunity policing, and the dire need for citizens engagement and involvement in security of our communities cannot be overstretched.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that unemployment rate in Nigeria between 2014 to 2020 had risen to an alarming rate of 35.3%, the group appealed to the federal government \u201cto intensify effort on the Nigerian youth employment action plan 2021 to 2024, review fiscal and monetary policies in the direction that will encourage the ease of doing business which inadvertently stimulate the growth of Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMSE\u2019s).\n\n\u201cWe also call on all Nigerian governors to also replicate same in their respective states because the unemployed/unengaged youth is a ready tool for all vices and crime.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

The 12 highways represent 1,963km or 5.6% of Nigeria\u2019s 35,000km Federal Highway as follows:\n\nBenin-Asaba, Abuja-Lokoja, Kano-Katsina, Onitsha-Owerri-Aba, Sagamu-Benin and Abuja-Keffi-Akwanga Highways; the others are Kano-Maiduguri, Kano-Shuarin, Kano-Maiduguri, Potiskum-Damaturu, Lokoja-Benin, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Ilorin-Jebba, Lagos-Otta-Abeokuta and Lagos-Badagry-Seme Border.\n\nThe Value-Added Concession Request for Proposal, RFP, Evaluation Report was presented and approved on Thursday, April 21, at the Project Steering Committee, PSC, meeting chaired by the Minister of Works & Housing, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola.\n\nMembers of the PSC from the Ministries of Works & Housing, Environment, Finance, Budget & National Planning and Justice, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, and Bureau of Public Enterprises attended the meeting.\n\nSpeaking, the Head, PPP Unit, FMWH, Abimbola Asein, disclosed that the Project Delivery Team, PDT, had concluded the evaluation of the Bidders\u2019 technical and Financial proposals and proposed Preferred/Reserved Bidders had been identified.\n\nShe, however, explained that the HDMI Project Steering Committee, PSC, reserves the right to disqualify any Preferred Bidder found to have supplied inaccurate or misleading information, following due diligence or is unable to reach a mutual agreement on the Project\u2019s Technical and Financial Parameters.\n\nThe PSC reiterated the importance of due diligence on the preferred bidders and recommended the constitution of a team made up of high-ranking officials from the relevant Ministries, noting that this would help achieve value for money for Nigeria during negotiations.\n\nThe rationale behind the HDMI, a private sector engagement, is to provide alternative sources of financing for road development and management in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is consistent with the provisions of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, ICRC, Establishment Act 2005; National Policy on Public-Private Partnership, \u201cN4P\u201d, Federal Highways Act CAP. 135, 1971; and Federal Roads and Bridges Tolling Policy.\n\n\u201cThe scope of the VAC under the HDMI includes the expansion, re-alignment, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the existing road pavements and bridges; construction of interchanges and pedestrian crossings and construction and operations of tolling facilities.\n\nThere is also the installation and operations of weighbridges; installation and operation of intelligent traffic systems for remote highway monitoring; physical patrol of the highway; provision of towing services, ambulance service, and refuse management. Others include the provision of directional signage, rest areas, and highway illumination, amongst others.\n\nThe Request for Qualification, RFQ, Notice was published on March 29, 2021, through the HDMI Portal. At the close of the RFQ portal on May 31 2021, 75 firms/Consortia successfully submitted valid applications.\n\nAn Inter-Ministerial Evaluation Committee evaluated the 75 submitted bids, wherein 18 firms / Consortia were prequalified, having met all the criteria outlined in the RFQ notice.\n\nThe RFP documents were then issued out to the 18 prequalified bidders on October 29, 2021, through the HDMI portal.\n\nThe deadline was February 22, 2022, while documents from the 18 bidders were officially opened during the RFP Bid opening ceremony held on February 23, 2022.\n\nThe Project is now at the Due Diligence Stage and will be followed by Negotiation of Technical and Financial Parameters. The Negotiated Parameters will be populated in the Full Business Case, FBC, to be forwarded to ICRC for FBC Compliance Certificate.\n\nThe Compliance Certificate will be presented to the Federal Executive Council, FEC, for consideration and approval. If approved, the Concession Agreement will be vetted by the Federal Ministry of Justice within a stipulated time frame to enable Commercial Close, it stated.",

          "title": "Earnings: Unilever swings back to profitability",
          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nCHALLENGES of erratic supply of public electricity, weak logistics, insecurity and other high costs of operations attributable to poor infrastructure has continued to make the business operating environment difficult, especially the real sector of the economy.\n\nThe increase in exchange rate has forced manufacturers to borrow at a high rate, thereby increasing cost of productions, made worse by the infrastructure deficiency, which has inevitably transfer the high production cost to consumers as this had made manufacturers less competitive, shrinking their profit margins, as naira\u2019s devaluation takes its toll on imported raw materials.\n\nHowever, despite the challenges, Unilever Nigeria Plc, which has for considerable period seen losses in earnings, has, during the half year 2020 swung back to profitability. Unilever built the remarkable comeback on expanding sales by the 35.07 per cent when compared to 2020, majority of it coming from its home and personal care products. When the closing bell rang on Friday, the company\u2019s share price stood at N12.20.\n\nIn its financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2020, released by the board, the revenue raked in by Unilever Nigeria dropped to N13.3 billion from N19.2 billion in the same period of last year.\n\nThe company said it had an operating profit of N453.5 million in Q1 2020, compared with N1.3 billion in Q1 2019 and a finance income of N495.6 million, lower than N803.9 million in the first quarter of last year, with the finance costs at slightly above half a million, compared with N94.4 million in Q1\u201919. Unilever Nigeria noted that while its profit before tax stood at N948.5 million versus N2.0 billion in Q1 2019, its profit after tax closed at March 31, 2020, at N1.1 billion as a result of a tax credit of N166.0 million.\n\nIn the same period of last year, the post-tax profit of the firm was N1.5 billion. The company, through its Corporate Affairs Director, Mrs. \u2018Soromidayo George, said \u201cUnilever Nigeria remains focused on its strategy to deliver sustainable growth and will continue to monitor the business environment and remain dynamic in its response to challenges to operations and the economy, in the light of COVID- 19.\u201d\n\nAccording to the filing in NGX, the company recorded a total turnover of N27.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared with N42.7 billion recorded in the same period of 2019. Also, in the results, the firm said its cost of sales stood at N21.2 billion in the period under consideration in contrast to N31.3 billion posted in the same time of 2019, while its gross profit went down to N6.2 billion from N11.4 billion.\n\nA further analysis showed that the sales and distribution expenses fell slightly to N1.8 billion from N1.9 billion, while in the first six months of 2020, the sum of N5.2 billion was used for market and administrative costs, lower than the N5.4 billion expended in the first six months of 2019. Its finance income decreased to N849.4 million from N1.2 billion, just as its finance costs significantly dropped to N5.2 million from N357.3 million.\n\nDespite having a tax credit of N47.7 million in the period under review, Unilever Nigeria declared a loss after tax of N519.1 million versus the profit after tax of N3.5 billion in the same period of last year.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) dropped to -9 kobo from 61 kobo in H1 2019. For the Q3, Unilever Nigeria Plc has reported a loss after tax of N1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as against loss of N3 billion in 2019. Loss before tax stood at N2.032 billion for 2020 as against N4.08 billion in 2019. Cost of sales stood at N13.66 billion from N10.68 billion in 2019.\n\nHowever, revenue grew by 93.92 per cent from N8.97 billion to N13.66 billion in 2020.\n\nAccording to analysts at Cordros Capital, the firm released its Q3-20 results with a reported loss per share of N0.27, its third quarterly loss in the last four quarters, owing to higher operating expenses and FX losses.\n\n\u201cConsequently, this dragged the 9M-20 loss per share down to N0.36. On a positive note, revenue (+93.9 per cent y/y) grew for the first time in eight quarters, far ahead of our expectations (16.2 per cent variance), underpinned by a strong recovery in volumes.\n\nUnilever Nigeria reported a profit after tax of N468.49 million for the full year ended December 31, 2020, as against loss of N4.76 billion in 2019. Profit before tax stood at N800.13 million for the 2020 as against N8.97 billion in 2019. Revenue grew by 84.34 per cent from N9.13 billion to N16.84 billion in 2020.\n\nUnilever reported a loss after tax of N1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, against loss of N3 billion in 2019. Loss before tax stood at N2.032 billion for the 2020 as against N4.08 billion in 2019. Cost of sales stood at N13.66 billion from N10.68 billion in 2019.\n\nHowever, revenue grew by 93.92 per cent from N8.97 billion to N13.66 billion in 2020. For 2020FY, analysts at Cordros Capital noted that the company recorded a smaller Loss Per Share of -N0.28 (-62.3 per cent y/y) compared to the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe achieved revenue was in line with our estimate (-0.6 per cent variance), but was 9.3 per cent ahead of the consensus estimate for 2020FY. Although we expected a loss for the year, the 2020FY loss per share was 40.6 per cent ahead of our estimate, owing largely to positive surprises in gross margin and the finance income line.\n\nConversely, the loss per share was 17.3 per cent behind the consensus estimate.\u201d Unilever Nigeria Plc has recorded turnover of N19.4 billion in its unaudited interim report for the quarter ended 31st March 2021, (Q1\u201921), representing a growth of 46 per cent from N13.3 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020,\n\nQ1\u201920. In the results released to the Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG), the company recorded a gross profit of N4.5 billion for Q1\u201921, which is 31 per cent up from N3.4 billion reported for same period of 2020. Overall, Unilever recorded loss after tax of N.5 billion for the quarter under review, compared to profit after tax of N1.1 billion reported for the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nUnilever Nigeria posted N714.780 million profit after tax for the half year ended June 30, 2021, against a loss after tax of N519.112 reported in 2020. Profit before tax stood at N830.402 million in contrast to a loss of N566.804 million posted in 2020. Revenue grew by 43 per cent to N39.150 billion in 2021 to N27.337 billion in 2020, while cost of sales was N29.275 billion in 2021 against N21.181 billion in 2020.\n\nUnilever Nigeria recorded a turnover of N58.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, compared to N44.7 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2020. The company said this in a statement on its unaudited interim report for the period ended September 30, 2021. It recorded a gross profit of N15.9 billion in the period under review, up 61 per cent from the N9.9 billion reported for same period of 2020.\n\nUnilever reported a profit after tax of N1.08 billion in Q3 2021, compared with a loss after tax of N2.06 billion reported for the corresponding period in 2020. The company ended year 2021 on December 31 in the green to sustain profitability. The firm saw a profit of N3.409 billion for the year against a loss of N3.965 billion recorded in 2020.\n\nRevenue grew to N73.523 billion from N52.211 billion, a growth of 35.07 per cent from the previous year. Cost of sales stood at N50.161 billion in 2021 in contrast to N41.136 recorded a year earlier.\n\nBased on the result, the Directors recommend to the shareholders the payment of a dividend in respect of year ended December 31, 2021, of N2.873 billion, that is, 50 kobo gross per share, which is payable on Friday May 6, 2022, subject to the deduction of appropriate withholding tax.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs and Sustainable Business Director, Soromidayo George, said while the company remained focused on its strategy to deliver sustainable growth, it was pleased with its performance, riding on the pillars of operational efficiency, cost optimisation, purposeful brands and increasing market share across key categories.\n\n\u201cUnilever Nigeria will continue to monitor the business environment and respond appropriately to the challenges in the operating environment, as well as disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d she added.\n\nAmidst the prevailing operational challenges of the environment, Unilever Nigeria will continue to focus on its vision of making sustainable living commonplace by serving Nigerian consumers with the right products that improve their health and wellbeing,\u201d George said.\n\nUnilever Nigeria\u2019s Board of Directors recently approved steps required to implement the separation of the tea business in Nigeria.\n\nIt is important for the company to continue to focus on developing homegrown solutions that will address the business needs of people and organisations.",

The venue of the declaration was filled to the brim while an almost equal crowd was seen outside the venue, with many support groups clad in different distinct attires, chanting solidarity songs.\n\n\u201cWith the payment for the forms, Governor Bello\u2019s teeming supporters should rest assured that he will be on the ballot in the 2023 presidential race.

We reiterate that he is not known for betrayal. He is always very loyal to his own and his priorities have always been Nigeria, Nigeria and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThough the race officially begins now, it is on record that Governor Bello has consistently been at the forefront of the contest. He has demonstrated this again by being the first to pay for the forms.\n\n\u201cWe urge delegates and indeed all Nigerians to shun divisive narratives in the interest of the nation and choose the best of the lot.

          "text": "A New York judge on Monday held former President Donald Trump in contempt of court for not producing documents subpoenaed in the state attorney general\u2019s civil probe of his business practices, and ordered Trump to be fined $10,000 per day until he complies.\n\nTrump lost a bid to quash a subpoena from state Attorney General Letitia James, and then failed to produce all the documents by a court-ordered March 3 deadline, later extended to March 31 at his lawyers\u2019 request.\n\nJustice Arthur Engoron ruled that a contempt finding was appropriate because of what the judge called \u201crepeated failures\u201d to hand over materials and because it was not clear Trump had conducted a complete search for responsive documents.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump \u2026 I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt,\u201d the judge said, although Trump himself was not in the courtroom.\n\nTrump intends to appeal the contempt ruling, said his attorney Alina Habba. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Habba said in a statement.\n\nShould Trump fail to pay the fine, he could be jailed, according to Sarah Krissoff, a New York lawyer not involved in the case, though she said such a scenario was unlikely and the judge could opt for other remedies such as increasing the amount of the fine.\n\nJames is investigating whether the Trump Organization, the former president\u2019s New York City-based family company, misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.\n\nShe has said the more than three-year-old probe found \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that the company included misleading asset valuations in its financial statements for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes clear: No one is above the law,\u201d James said in a statement on Monday.\n\nTrump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated. James is a Democrat.\n\nThe attorney general has questioned how the Trump Organization valued the Trump brand, as well as properties including golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump\u2019s own penthouse apartment in Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower.\n\nAlso on Monday, Engoron granted a motion by James\u2019 office to compel real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield to comply with certain subpoenas. Cushman conducted appraisals for several Trump Organization properties.\n\nTrump and two of his adult children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., also were subpoenaed and ordered to provide testimony to the attorney general. An appeal is pending for the testimony.\n\nCOERCION, NOT PUNISHMENT\n\nAndrew Amer, special litigation counsel with the attorney general\u2019s office, said during the hearing that the $10,000-a-day fine was meant to coerce Trump into complying with the subpoena, not punish him.\n\nHabba told the judge that Trump did indeed comply with the subpoena, but that he did not have any documents responsive to James\u2019 request. Engoron said she would have to submit a detailed affidavit about her search of Trump\u2019s records in order to be in compliance with the subpoena.\n\nSuch an affidavit would need to show that Trump\u2019s team had conducted a diligent search for documents, said Halim Dhanidina, a former California judge now practicing as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s not going to just take someone\u2019s word for it,\u201d Dhanidina said.\n\nThe Trump Organization\u2019s property valuations are also the subject of a criminal probe in Manhattan, which last year led to the indictment of the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said this month that probe is ongoing despite the departure of its two top lawyers.",

          "text": "Moscow accused NATO of engaging in a proxy battle against Russia by arming Ukraine, saying this had created a serious and real risk of nuclear war.\n\nIn a marked escalation of Russian rhetoric, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was asked on state television about the importance of avoiding World War Three and whether the current situation was comparable to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cThe risks now are considerable,\u201d Lavrov said, according to the ministry\u2019s transcript of the interview.\n\n\u201cI would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\n\u201cNATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s remarks came as U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin was set to convene a meeting of more than 40 countries at a German air base to discuss arming Ukraine to help it fight off Russia\u2019s latest military assault in the east.\n\n\u201cThe next several weeks will be very, very critical,\u201d Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told reporters traveling with him. \u201cThey need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\u2019s really the purpose of this conference.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to coordinate aid that includes heavy weapons such as howitzer artillery, as well as killer drones and ammunition, General Milley said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he regarded Russia\u2019s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nRussia had lost its \u201clast hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,\u201d Kuleba wrote on Twitter after Lavrov\u2019s interview. \u201cThis only means Moscow senses defeat.\u201d\n\nBritain also played down the Russian threat.\n\n\u201cLavrov\u2019s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\u2019t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation,\u201d Armed Services Minister James Heappey told BBC Television.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday approved the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine. The Pentagon said the package could include ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\u2019s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nGUTERRES TO MOSCOW\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was due in Moscow on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin and Lavrov, the highest profile peace mission since the war began, although Western countries have said they have little hope of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia\u2019s two-month-old invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West call this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nWAR RAGES IN SOUTH, EAST\n\nRussia has yet to capture any of Ukraine\u2019s biggest cities. Its huge invasion force was forced to pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance last month. But it has since announced new war aims to focus mainly on the east, and sent more troops there for an assault on two provinces where it has backed a separatist revolt.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that every day \u2013 and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun \u2013 that everyone in Ukraine is concerned with peace, about when it will all be over,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere is no simple answer to that at this time.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said on Tuesday that Russia\u2019s offensive continued in the eastern Kharkiv region with Russian forces trying to advance towards a village called Zavody.\n\nWhile focusing on the east and south, Russia has also been striking targets in other parts of Ukraine with missiles and air strikes. Its defence ministry said it had destroyed six facilities powering railways used to deliver foreign weapons to Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s state rail company said one railway worker had been killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five railway stations on Monday.\n\nUkrainian forces have repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, said the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors. Five tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement. The reports could not be verified.\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\u2019s east, the British military said in an update on Tuesday.\n\nReports say the town of Kreminna has fallen, with heavy fighting in the south of the city of Izyum, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, Britain\u2019s defence ministry said on Twitter.\n\nThe governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod border province, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine had fired on two villages across the frontier and at least two people were wounded.\n\nRussian forces kept up their bombing and shelling of the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "UN Chief Embarks on Moscow Trip Amid Criticism",
          "text": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will start a difficult three-day trip to Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday amid criticism for the limited role played by the United Nations in the management of the crisis.\n\nThree months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, UN agencies are struggling to reach civilians under siege in the east of the country, where humanitarian assistance is sporadic.\n\nMeanwhile the UN Security Council, where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power, has failed to pass any resolutions condemning the war.\n\nGuterres may want to use this trip to revitalise the UN initiative in the humanitarian field, experts said, while staying away from more controversial political questions.\n\n\u201cGuterres will try to provide a new momentum for the UN to play a role for humanitarian access in the evacuation of civilians, especially from Mariupol, and in a broader context to allow better access of UN and other humanitarian agencies to the conflict zones,\u201d said Jean-Marc Rickli, head of Global and Emerging Risks at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.\n\nGuterres is due to meet in Moscow with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin. But the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to kick off the first leg of his trip at the Kremlin has caused upset in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset this trip has started off on the wrong foot,\u201d said Rickli. \u201cIn such a polarised environment where disinformation is so facilitated by social media, anything Guterres will do or say might be weaponised from one side or the other of the conflict.\u201d\n\nLast month, the UN\u2019s refugee agency UNHCR came under fire by Ukrainian officials who accused it of being unprepared to address the humanitarian crisis. Similarly, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was criticised for its alleged inaction and for visiting Russia. ICRC\u2019s President Peter Maurer was in Moscow in a bid to negotiate access to the conflict areas.\n\nlined diplomatically in the peace talks led by Turkey. Analysts said Guterres may wish to discuss the role the UN could provide in future peace talks with regard to UN infrastructure and services, especially in case of a future agreement where there could be peacekeeping forces deployed. Nevertheless, they agree it is premature to talk about peace.\n\n\u201cWe should not expect any major breakthroughs out of this meeting, because the situation is not ripe for a compromise,\u201d said Andrey Kortunov, the Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council.\n\nUN weakness\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine seem ready for serious negotiations.\n\nMoscow has redeployed its forces to Ukraine\u2019s east with the goal of the conquest and probable annexation of the Donbas region. Meanwhile, Ukraine has been emboldened by the success of its resistance movement since the Russians invaded on February 24.\n\n\u201cMr Guterres is in a difficult position, because neither country is willing to hold peace talks,\u201d said Rickli.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin might want to use his meeting with Guterres to present Russia\u2019s narrative on the invasion of Ukraine, which it has framed as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to the international community.\n\n\u201cHe is likely to repeat his standard narrative about the roots of the conflict and he will try to justify his decisions,\u201d Kortunov said.\n\n\u201cHe might also complain about what he believes to be hypocrisy and double standards of the West.\u201d\n\nPutin and Guterres have very different views of the world and practice different leadership styles, Kortunov noted. Despite differences, however, Moscow has sanctioned Guterres\u2019s election to the post, and the two men have good relations.\n\nLast week, Guterres called for a ceasefire during Orthodox Easter that would allow for the safe passage of civilians from areas of current and expected confrontation in coordination with the ICRC. In addition, he called on the parties to allow for the delivery of life-saving aid to people in the hardest-hit areas such as Mariupol, the coastal city that has been besieged for weeks. His appeals were ignored.\n\nExperts said the weakness of Guterres reflects the constraints of the structure he represents.\n\n\u201cIn this environment for the UN to play a meaningful role in peacemaking is currently almost impossible. The UN\u2019s weakness is a result of its very structure, notably the veto power of the permanent members of the UN Security Council which paralyses the organisation because of the ongoing polarisation between the West and the Russia-China axis.\u201d Rickli said. Although China has called for peace talks, it has not condemned Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nance in Ukraine, of whom more than one-third are in Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. The UN says this figure is due to increase to 15.7 million, about 40 per cent of all Ukrainians still left in the country, if the conflict continues.\n\nDespite constraints on the ground, the UN says some 2.5 million people have been provided with assistance in the past seven weeks, including many in the east.\n\nAccording to Shabia Mantoo, spokesperson at the UNHCR, about 4.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Bhanu Bhatnagar of the World Health Organization said the body has delivered 218 tonnes of emergency and medical supplies to Ukraine and roughly two-thirds of that, about 132 tonnes, have reached their intended destinations in the east and north of the country.\n\nJakob Kern, World Food Programme emergency coordinator for Ukraine, said Mariupol would probably need about two to three trucks a day of food alone. At the moment, the agency has been able to send in 10 trucks a month.",
