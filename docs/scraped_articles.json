          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja has rejected the request by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to play video evidence in the ongoing trial of former Group Managing Director (GMD) Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Andrew Yakubu.\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed, in a ruling, on Wednesday, dismissed the application on the grounds that Yakubu wasn\u2019t the maker of the exhibits and as such, he could not be cross-examined based on those documents.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Justice Mohammed had, on June 30, fixed July 14 for ruling on the EFCC\u2019s application.\n\nThe EFCC\u2019s lawyer, Farouk Abdullah, had sought an order of the court to play video documents which were tendered while taking the evidence of the sixth prosecution witness (PW6) on Oct. 17, 2018, and admitted in evidence by the court in cross-examining Yakubu, who was in the witness box as the first defence witness (DW1).\n\nHowever, Ahmed Raji, SAN, counsel to the defendant, opposed the anti-graft agency\u2019s application.\n\nRaji had argued that Yakubu wasn\u2019t a maker of the exhibits which in the eyes of law were documents.\n\nHe also argued that allowing such application would be going contrary to \u201cthe directives of the Court of Appeal as to what is to be done in the suit.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Mohammed, however, disagreed with the EFCC in his ruling.\n\nThe Judge also deferred the EFCC\u2019s fresh application to recall two prosecution witnesses (PWs) for a re-examination pending when Yakubu\u2019s cross-examination is completed.\n\nMohammed noted that Yakubu, who had been in the witness box as DW1 (first defence witness) since July 8, 2020, had already given his evidence before the court.\n\nHe held that it would be unfair to keep the defendant in the witness box for over a year and grant such prayer when the cross-examination was yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the application to recall two witnesses is deferred until the DW1 cross-examination is completed,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nHe, however, adjourned the case until July 29 for the continuation of the cross-examination of Yakubu.\n\nRecall that Yakubu was arraigned on March 16, 2017, on six counts but the trial court struck out counts five and six.",

          "text": "The Ogun State House of Assembly has told traditional rulers in the state that it will not allow the use of human beings for rituals during the installation or burial of a monarch.\n\nThe Speaker of the Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, said this on Wednesday while declaring open, a public hearing on the traditional council law of Ogun State 2021 at the Assembly Complex, Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nOluomo stated that the lawmakers are not against traditional rites for installation and burial of Obas in the state, saying, however, that the use of humans for the purpose is barbaric and no longer allowed.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying they should not do traditional rites for installation and burial of Obas, but we are not going to support the usage of human being for rituals, as the world has moved away from that barbaric practice, which is even against the right to life and human dignity as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u201d, the speaker declared.\n\nThe speaker clarified that the bill does not set out to specifically tinker with the burial rites as being speculated.\n\nRather, Oluomo explained that the legislation was initiated to correct many existing anomalies in the traditional institution, especially the conduct of installation without following due process including absence of declaration for some traditional stools, which, he said, has been creating difficulty on how to determine those entitled to the throne.\n\nThe speaker submitted that such \u201cunethical practice\u201d had made it easy for unqualified persons and strangers to lay unmerited claims to the stool, thereby creating distortions in historical records in recent times.\n\nOluomo mentioned that the Assembly would pass a bill that would put a stop to the attendance of political rallies by monarchs, thereby returning the institution to its pride of place and honour.\n\n\u201cWe have equally seen where a town or village is in existence (as orile) and the Baale is there, but in their developed area, where plots of land were sold to strangers to erect residential structure, such strangers were later allotted a traditional stool illegally, instead of promoting the existing Baale to the status of a coronet Oba. It has been the new norm of short-changing the original inhabitants of the area in the selection of monarchs to the advantage of strangers which must stop.\n\n\u201cThese are part of the things we are trying to correct and if you look at the number of petitions before the House and litigations going on in the various courts of law in the State, over 70% of such court cases are based on Obaship issues because of the lacuna and errors of application of the existing traditional council laws\u201d, the speaker stated.\n\nIn their contributions, other stakeholders including the representatives of Egba Traditional Council and Towulade of Akinale Kingdom, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye; National Secretary, Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, Comrade Yinka Folarin; Chief Imam of Gbagura, Prof. Kamaldeen Balogun; harped on the essence of peaceful co-existence among religious groups and commended the Assembly on the proposed bill with an assurance of conveying their positions through memoranda in due course.\n\nAlso, the representatives of the traditional worshipers\u2019 group, Fagbemi Ifakorede from Ota and the State Secretary of Ifa worshippers, Faniyi Awoyemi, noted that the traditional belief remained essential in the running of traditional institution, stating that monarchs were to be buried in line with the traditions and customs of their people.",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nA Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, rejected the request by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to play video evidence in the ongoing trial of Andrew Yakubu, former Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed, in a ruling, dismissed the application on the grounds that Yakubu was not the maker of the exhibits and as such, he could not be cross-examined based on those documents.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Justice Mohammed had, on June 30, fixed today for ruling on the anti-corruption agency\u2019s application.\n\nThe agency\u2019s lawyer, Farouk Abdullah, had sought an order of the court to play video documents which were tendered while taking the evidence of the sixth prosecution witness (PW6) on Oct. 17, 2018, and admitted in evidence by the court in cross-examining Yakubu, who was in the witness box as the first defence witness (DW1).\n\nThe court had marked the documents tendered as Exhibits \u201cM,\u201d \u201cN\u201d and \u201cN1.\u201d\n\nWhile Exhibits \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d were compact discs, Exhibit \u201cN1\u201d was a memory card.\n\nHowever, Counsel to the defendant, Ahmed Raji, SAN, opposed the EFCC\u2019s application.\n\nRaji had argued that Yakubu was not a maker of the exhibits which in the eyes of law were documented.\n\n\u201cThis ought to have been done through the witness who produced the document (PW6) and who is the maker and who tendered exhibits in them,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe senior lawyer also argued that allowing such application would be going contrary to \u201cthe directives of the Court of Appeal as to what is to be done in the suit.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC lawyer also disagreed with Raji.\n\nAbdullah had enjoined the court to look at the provisions of the Evidence Act as to whether a counsel in a trial has a right to make use of exhibits already before the court at any stage of proceedings in determining an issue, particularly in cross-examination.\n\nHe submitted that an exhibit already before a court could be used to either establish a fact or dispel a fact at any stage of a proceeding.\n\n\u201cIt is a right that can be enjoyed by both prosecution and defence.\n\n\u201cWe urge my lord to so hold and answer this in affirmative,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe Judge, however, disagreed with the EFCC in his ruling.\n\nJustice Mohammed also deferred the agency\u2019s fresh application to recall two prosecution witnesses (PWs) for a re-examination pending when Yakubu\u2019s cross-examination is completed.\n\nAbdullah had applied for a recall of two of the agency\u2019s PWs in the trial following the court\u2019s rejection of his request to play the video evidence.\n\nBut Raji opposed the prayer, arguing that since the EFCC had called all its witnesses and closed its case, \u201crecalling those witnesses when the defendant had already opened his defence and he is in the witness box will only interrupt the proceeding.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that allowing the prayer would not be doing justice to the defendant who had been in the witness box for over a year.\n\nHe urged the court to defer the anti-graft commission\u2019s application until his client\u2019s cross-examination is completed.\n\nRuling, the judge noted that Yakubu, who had been in the witness box as DW1 (first defence witness) since July 8, 2020, had already given his evidence before the court.\n\nMohammed held that it would be unfair to keep the defendant in the witness box for over a year and grant such prayer when the cross-examination was yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the application to recall two witnesses is defer until the DW1 cross-examination is completed,\u201d he ruled.\n\nAbdullah then applied for a short adjournment to enable him to produce some documents which would be relevant in cross-examining Yakubu.\n\nRaji described the application as \u201ca deliberate attempt to prolong the proceeding for reason known to the prosecution.\u201d\n\nHe said in order to delay processing, the EFCC lawyer had been coming up with one application or another.\n\n\u201cMy lord, I want it to be on record because if a defence counsel does this, especially senior lawyers, the same song will be \u2018oh, they don\u2019t allow criminal trials to move.\n\n\u201cMy lord, a diligent prosecution would have come with everything,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRaji, who said the application for adjournment was lacking in merit, urged the court to refuse it.\n\n\u201cIt is against the spirit of justice and Administration of Criminal Justice Act),\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge said though the court was not inclined to granting the plea considering the time the exercise had taken, he adjourned the case until July 29 for the continuation of the cross examination of Yakubu.\n\nNAN reports that the anti-graft agency had, in 2017, raided the residence of the ex-NNPC boss in Kaduna and found 9, 772, 800 dollars and 74, 000 pounds (9.7 million dollars and 74, 000 pounds) in a safe.\n\nYakubu was, however, arraigned on March 16, 2017, on six counts but the trial court struck out counts five and six.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also ordered the former GMD to defend only counts three and four which bordered on failure to make full disclosure of assets, receiving cash without going through a financial institution.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) and the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) have applauded the rejection of presidential aide, Lauretta Onochie, as national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the Senate.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the rejection is a victory for democracy and triumph of the people over attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to corrupt INEC ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe nomination of Onochie by the Presidency was trailed by controversy, which reached a climax, yesterday, as the Senate rejected the nomination.\n\nThe Senate said its action was based on abuse of Federal Character principle, which states that every part of the country must be represented.\n\nDelta State where Onochie hails from has a serving national commissioner in INEC.\n\nThe Senate also stepped down confirmation of Professor Sani Muhammad Adam as a national commissioner, until further notice over some unresolved issues.\n\nThe PDP said the rejection of Onochie has saved the country from a serious crisis and salvaged INEC and the entire Nigerian electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe party asserts that Onochie\u2019s vexatious nomination, in total affront to paragraph 14 of the 3rd schedule of the 1999 Constitution was a very dangerous machination by the Buhari-led APC Presidency against our electoral process, in the attempt to subvert the will of the people in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe APC, in spite of its shenanigans, is aware that it will have difficulties winning election at any level in a free, fair and credible election and as such it is determined to rig every process ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cOur party, therefore, commends Nigerians including civil society organisations, the media as well as other political parties, for joining forces with the PDP in fighting for the sanctity of our electoral process by resisting Onochie\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThe stiff resistance displayed by Nigerians across board, in repelling this vicious attempt to hijack and pollute the electoral commission, underscores their collective and unwavering determination to resist and kick out the APC in 2023, despite its shenanigans,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nThe CTA, in a statement by its Executive Director, Faith Nwadishi, said Onochie\u2019s rejection would augur well for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cMadam Onochie\u2019s presence in INEC would have in great measures impinged on the integrity of the Electoral Management Board and put to question the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Senate has done the needful by listening to the voice of the people even though pressured by Nigerians to be accountable to the people and represent the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cCTA calls on CSOs and Nigerians to still be vigilant and look forward to the National Assembly passing an Electoral Bill that will have electronic transmission of results by INEC and addresses all other issues raised by Nigerians. Citizen\u2019s power keeps hope alive for our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, NYCN said the rejection is a victory for democracy and confirmation of the independence of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group, through its president, Isah Abubakar, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advisers against such controversial nominations to avoid a repeat of what could be described as a coup against the Nigeria Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe admonish the leaders of the National Assembly to continue to put Nigeria\u2019s democracy first above party/individual sentiments,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigerians should congratulate themselves for remaining one despite ongoing challenges that could have torn us apart.\n\nA statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said Buhari stated this when he received the report of the National Security Summit held on May 26, 2021by the House of Representatives. The report was submitted by a team of House members led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the President urged leaders to respect the wishes of people and allow them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nHe also restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 states during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the 9th National Assembly for its cooperation with the executive, he said he tried very hard to get the 8th Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much. But time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nHe said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit.\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that would be implemented by the executive.\n\nSpeaking to State House Correspondents after the event, the speaker said the report suggested the creation of regional development commissions for all regions of the country and also proffered resolutions to military complexities.\n\n\u201cThere are several recommendations; we\u2019ve agreed to establish zonal commissions in all the zones like the North East Development Commission. We\u2019ll have the South West, South-South, South East, North West, and that goes a long way in resolving issues, regional and zonal issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Doris Obinna\n\nNigerians have told the National Assembly to throw out the controversial Nigerian Press Council (NPC) and the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Acts amendment in its entirety.\n\nThis followed the disclosure by its sponsor, Olusegun Odebunmi, yesterday, that legislative process on it has been suspended.\n\nThe federal lawmaker from Oyo State, said on a live television programme, that he initiated the suspension to allow for consultation with stakeholders in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe have suspended the process for more consultation to happen on it. They demanded for a lot of time and I said \u2018no problem, we have given you; even if you spend three, four to five weeks\u2019. So far, more consultations from critical stakeholders, and many people have been submitting their memoranda to the National Assembly even within the industry.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi said his intention is not to gag the press, saying he recognises the lapses in the practice of journalism in Nigeria, and that the amendments are aimed at fixing those problems.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to gag the press, and unless all the practitioners can say all is well with the industry, to the best of my knowledge I know all is not well, and I know the National Assembly has the power to look into the existing Act. All is not well with the NPC agency, it is an agency of government, and you\u2019re expecting something to be given back to the society, but until now nothing has been coming from the agency.\u201d\n\nReacting, National President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, told Daily Sun that the body was not interested in the suspension but its outright cancellation.\n\n\u201cWe do not support a suspension. What we want as a body is for the bill to be completely thrown away, and if a new bill is to be made, all the relevant stakeholders must be carried along from inception.\u201d\n\nFormer national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Chekwas Okorie also called for the abolition of the bills.\n\n\u201cIt should be dropped completely because whatever was the intention for proposing the bill is definitely in very bad taste and has been rejected not just by the media practitioners, but Nigerians. The National Assembly should withdraw it completely without waiting for it to be rejected.\u201d\n\nNational President, Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mustapha Isa, said the National Assembly, in the first instance, has no right to amend a bill being challenged in the Supreme Court and insisted that suspension is not enough.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is outright dropping of the bill, not suspension. If they want to do another one, let them start by first having a meeting with stakeholders, so that we would collectively decide on what should be in the bill. You don\u2019t first put such a bill together before you start discussing with stakeholders. If you mean, before you put a bill together, ensure that you meet with us and not after.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the bill is anti-people and should be dropped completely.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbodiyan, said it did not come as a surprise that the Senate suspended further deliberations on the bill.\n\n\u201cIt portends danger for our collective freedom of speech and our constitutionally guaranteed access to information. It is very relieving that the Senate has suspended further deliberations on the satanic Bill, but we want it to be dropped permanently.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, commended the legislators for the suspension but demanded it should be thrown away because it is evil.\n\n\u201cWe should be making progress and doing the things that other developed nations are doing. We cannot go back to the analogue era when the world is going digital. We are in a global community. So, I commend them because they did well.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, praised the Senate for suspending the bill but said they should move a step further to drop it completely.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from all kinds of problems so much that to silence us or beat us and not allow us to cry is worsening our situation. So, the suspension is a good thing, but they should think of dropping it entirely.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonna, said the suspension is to enable them gather more public opinion about the bill to know the next line of action. \u201cSo, what they did is in order. I commend them for that.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary,Middle Belt Forum, Dogo Isuwa, said instead of rejoicing over the suspension, the media should first identify those areas in the Bill that are not making sense and enlighten Nigerians on the negative effects of those clauses, otherwise the National Assembly could still reintroduce the bill and pass into law in future.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, welcomed the suspension.\n\n\u201cThough the Senate said the bill is intended to regulate the media, the real intention is to gag the media. Afenifere believes in the freedom of expression, especially in a way that reflects the right of people to express their mind, but not in a scandalous or libelous manner. The bill should not have come up in the first place because there are various bodies that regulate the media.\u201d\n\nFormer chairman, Lagos NUJ chairman, Dr. Quasim Akinreti, said the voice of reason has prevailed with the suspension.\n\n\u201cThe initiator of that Bill jumped the gun without consulting stakeholders. For me, what the government is doing is not in the interest of the people.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says 542,576 Nigerians have completed online voter registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed the determination of the commission to deepen democracy through the use of technology.\n\nHe also put the number of Nigerians who have completed online voters\u2019 pre-registration at 542,576.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the resident electoral commissioners, said: \u201cI would like to reassure Nigerians that the commission will continue to spare no effort in deepening the use of technology to ensure electoral transparency and credibility.\u201d\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the clamour for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, amidst efforts by the leadership of the National Assembly to delete the provision from the bill.\n\nYakubu said the voters\u2019 register remained at the heart of any credible election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that just as we had a smooth take-off of the online pre-registration, the commencement of the physical registration will similarly be hitch-free.\u201d\n\nHe said the first quarter of the physical registration would commence between June 28 and September 30, while the second quarter of the exercise will start October 4 to December 30.\n\nAlso, the third quarter of the physical registration will start from January 3, 2022, to April 1, 2022, and the fourth quarter will kick off on April 11 to June 30, 2022.\n\nGiving update of the exercise, Yakubu said two weeks since the exercise began, a total of 542,576 Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration.\n\nAccording to him, out of this figure, 456,909 are fresh registrants while 85,667 have applied for voter transfer, replacement of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and update of voter information record among others.\n\nHe added that the commission is able to provide Nigerians with information on the distribution of registrants across the states and by age, occupation, gender and disability.\n\n\u201cOut of 542,576 online registrants so far, 356,777 (or 66 per cent) are young people between the ages of 18 and 34 years.\n\n\u201cThis is followed by 134,719 middle-aged registrants who fall between 35 and 49 years. The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says people should be free to choose leaders of their choice irrespective of party, religion\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria is lucky to have remained as one indivisible entity notwithstanding the myriad of problems incuding security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThis is just as he also canvassed for the citizens right to choose a leader of their choice at elections irrespective of party affiliation or religion.\n\nThe President made this disclosure Tuesday at the State House, Abuja while receiving the report of the National Security Summit of the House of Representatives from the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nPresident Buhari declared, \u201cwe are a lucky country and should congratulate ourselves, despite challenges that could have torn us apart.\u201d\n\nHe urged leaders to respect the people, from the lowest to the highest, \u201cso that it becomes a duty to them (the people) to pay back to the leadership.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, repect for the people should come in allowing them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nDescribing the event as \u201ca remarkable occasion,\u201d President Buhari restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 States during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the Ninth National Assembly for its cooperation with the Executive, the President said he tried very hard to get the Eighth Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much, but time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the very beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by the lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit, \u201cand Mr President was very eager and enthusiastic about it, showing the importance you place on security.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that will be implemented by the Executive.\n\n\u201cThank you Mr President for what you have done so far to douse tension and for Nigeria to remain one. It\u2019s about all of us, not just the Executive, the legislature or the judiciary. And Nigeria will work, by the grace of God\u201d, the Speaker further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A High Court in Kenya has ordered Safaricom to pay a blind man KSh6 million ($56,000) for failing to hire him after he had gone through the entire recruitment process.\n\nWilson Macharia sued the network operator to seek compensation because his rights were violated, BusinessDaily reported. He told Justice James Makau that Safaricom declined to employ him as a customer care executive on grounds that it did not have specialised software to help him with his work.\n\nMacharia said he responded to an advert by Safaricom in August 2016 for a customer experience executive position, which invited qualified Kenyans irrespective of \u201crace, colour, religion, gender, tribal origin, disability or age\u201d.\n\nAlong with other persons living with disabilities, Macharia was shortlisted for the job, went through the oral interview and medical test, after which he was invited to sign the contract in July 2017. However, Safaricom said the invite was erroneous.\n\nIn its defense, the telecoms firm denied discriminating against the plaintiff and argued that it allowed Macharia to be interviewed for the job but that it lacked specialised software that would enable him to work.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company violated Macharia\u2019s rights and failed to treat him with dignity as it should have informed him earlier that the software was unavailable instead of making him go through the recruitment process only to later claim the letter was sent erroneously.\n\n\u201cI find that the Respondent\u2019s excuse to be an afterthought that was introduced late to the detriment of the Petitioner. The Respondent knew right from the beginning that the Petitioner\u2019s work called for software, yet they took him through all recruitment steps,\u201d Justice Makau ruled.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that there are over 650 million people around the world who live with disabilities; 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school and the literacy rate for adults with disabilities is as low as 3%.\n\nIn addition, millions of people with disabilities want to get jobs but can\u2019t get hired. Even in developed economies, they struggle to find employment.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "Spazio Ideale designs iconic workspaces for tech companies like Paystack, uLesson, others",
          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",
          "summary": "The acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers.\nSpazio Ideale team.\nThat\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201dBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new appointment\n\nVerifyMe\u2019s VeriFind launch\n\nMobile app downloads skyrocket\n\nFlutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer, Oluwabankole Falade. Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

          "text": "The Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has declared that contrary to the accusation that the state governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, was biased against Muslims in the appointment of commissioners in his dissolved cabinet, the governor has, indeed, been fair to the Muslim Ummah in all the activities and programmes of his administration.\n\nIt added that views contained in a recent press statement purportedly authored on behalf of the Muslim Community of Oyo State did not represent the position of the Muslim Ummah in the state.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the NSCIA in Oyo State, Alhaji Shaikh Busairi; the Grand Mufti of the Council, Alhaji Khalifah Yusuf Alagunfon and the Public Relations Officer of the Council, Alhaji Sulayman Seriki, made this position during a visit to the office of the Special Assistant to Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde on Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Imam AbdRasheed AbdulAzeez.\n\nThe trio, who spoke to journalists in Ibadan, the state capital, warned Muslim leaders to avoid hypocrisy and playing to the gallery.\n\nA statement signed by the Special Assistant (Print Media) to Governor Makinde, Moses Alao, quoted the Council as urging those criticising Makinde in the name of the Muslim community to stop being ungrateful to Allah for what he has done for the Muslim Ummah through the governor.\n\nThe statement maintained that contrary to the claim that only five of the commissioners in the recently dissolved cabinet were Muslims, eight of the 16 former commissioners were actually Muslims.\n\nWhile speaking, the Secretary-General of the Council, Shaikh Busairi said: \u201cIt is not wrong to advise the government on any issue. What is wrong is that anyone that intends well or means well should not play to the gallery when advising. That is an erroneous approach. If you actually mean well, there is nothing stopping you from making contact with the government, especially now that we have an SA on Islamic Affairs. You can channel our affairs through that office.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, we have gone into the archives to search into what actually used to transpire in government in Oyo State. We found out that the number of Muslim Commissioners in the previous government were not up to the number we had in the first two years of Governor Makinde.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut it has been the antics of the people behind that writing; they always cook up stories in the corners of their rooms and use such stories to represent the entire population of Muslims in the state. We in the NSCIA have been critical of that kind of approach. If at all we want to help the cause of Muslims and the cause of Islam, there are better ways.\n\n\u201cAnything that is going to represent the interest of the Muslims in a community, such things should be aired at a meeting of all interest groups. But that did not happen. If it did, then maybe they would have had reasonable information that would have dissuaded them from writing that open letter. So, in a nutshell, they are not representing the interest of Muslims in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the NSCIA, there was no bias in the appointments made in the state. In fact, we have been at the vanguard of telling the public that Governor Makinde has been fair to Muslims. In the last two years, he has not been found wanting in terms of doing that which was never in existence in the state before.\n\nHe said that among things, the governor has been identifying with Muslims, stating that Makinde has never been found wanting in terms of fairness to Muslims.\n\n\u201cBut we know the antics of those who signed that statement; they are just trying to cry wolf where there is none just to register that they are still in existence.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow such misrepresentation to go on; that is why we have come to the SA Islamic Affairs to register that what we are reading on the social media is not to our knowledge and that we do not subscribe to what they wrote in that press release and that they are not representing the interests of Muslims in the state. The views they expressed only represent the opinion of their clique and they know what they are gunning for. But they will never realise their diabolical ambition,\u201d Busairi added.\n\nSimilarly, the Grand Mufti of NSCIA, Oyo State, Alh. Alagunfon maintained that the governor has been fair to Muslims, urging those behind the criticism of Governor Makinde to soft-pedal, because \u201cMakinde has done very well for the Muslim Ummah and we should not be ungrateful to him.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the SA Islamic Affairs, Imam AbdulAzeez appreciated the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, for visiting his office, urging them to continue to encourage Muslims to support Governor Makinde\u2019s government and to pray for its success.\n\nAccording to AbdulAzeez, Governor Makinde\u2019s government will always be fair to Islam and other religions, adding that the governor is \u201ca lover of Islam and Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I once said, His Excellency has been a blessing to Islam and the Muslims in Oyo State. His government has undertaken several efforts that demonstrate that the governor believes in fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cWe have the celebration of Mawlud Nabiyy and declaration of Hijrah as public holiday, donation of buses to Islamic organisations including The Central Mosque of Ibadan land, Lanase Central Mosque, Sabo Central Mosque (of the Hausa community) and the maintenance of the use of Hijabs in schools in the state, among others, to show for the governor\u2019s fair disposition.\n\n\u201cMuslims should, therefore, continue to pray for the success of this administration and Oyo state at large,\u201d AbdulAzeez said.",

The Senate should be quite correct if it pegs the age of the candidates at 16 years. If you talk of gifted children, how many are they in a class? Whoever must have argued for it must be an expert in sociology and psychology.\n\n\u201cIt is not ideal for any child to go and take the UTME or school certificate exam under 16 years. Even those in the university are just there to satisfy their parents. It is not encouraging. It pains me when I see a child not up to one year and they are already taking her to school. It is wrong; the child should first be educated at home.\n\n\u201cWhen you rush a child too early, the child rushes out too early without learning. Parents should dedicate more time to their children.

People pick up educationally at different times, as such, there should be no age limit to education,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, President, NPTAN, Mr Haruna Danjuma, said writing the UTME at an early age would be of no benefit to students.\n\n\u201cIf the government says a minimum of 16 years is okay, there is nothing wrong with that.

Rivers had six, Oyo reported five more infections, Ekiti \u2013 4, Ogun \u2013 4, FCT \u2013 2, Gombe \u2013 2, and Kwara \u2013 1.\n\nAs of the time of this report, Nigeria has confirmed 168,867 cases while 164,623 have been discharged.

In public places across the country, Nigerians have jettisoned the adoption of safety measures such as washing hands and the use of face masks.

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",

Psaki said the president still supported U.S. athletes traveling to Tokyo for the competition despite the rise in coronavirus cases. President Biden is not attending the Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of the careful preparations, including the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators, that the government and international committee has undertaken, which is why, as we said, we support the Games moving forward,\u201d Psaki said.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the president\u2019s chief medical adviser, said last week that he didn\u2019t have any concerns about a trip to Tokyo by the first lady, who is 70 years old and fully vaccinated. He said the protocols to protect her health are \u201crather stringent\u201d and that \u201cthe final choice of what she\u2019d do, obviously, is up to her.\u201d\n\nShe has decided to follow her predecessors who also led U.S. delegations to the Olympics.\n\nHillary Clinton traveled to the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games and the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nLaura Bush led the delegation to the Turin Olympics in 2006. She also accompanied President George W. Bush to Beijing for the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in China.\n\nMichelle Obama led a delegation to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nJill Biden last attended the Olympics in 2010, when she and then-Vice President Joe Biden, led the U.S. delegation to the Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada.",
