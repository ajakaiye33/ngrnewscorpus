          "text": "The House of Representatives has raised the alarm over a looming natural disaster in communities in the Eti Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State over the encroachment of the lagoon.\n\nThe House, therefore, urged the Ecological Fund Office to \u201ccarry out an immediate Environmental Impact Assessment of Eti Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State with the aim of mitigating against climate change and natural hazards like ocean surge, flooding and storms that may occur in the nearest future.\u201d\n\nAlso, the House mandated its Committees on Ecological Fund and Legislative Compliance to ensure implementation of the resolution.\n\nThe resolution was passed following the unanimous adoption of a motion moved by the lawmaker representing Eti Osa Federal Constituency in Lagos State, Ibrahim Obanikoro, which was titled, \u2018Need to stop the lagoon encroachment on properties in Eti Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe House is disturbed that there are already threats to lives and properties in areas like Banana Island, Park View Estate, Osborne Foreshore Estate, Ikoyi, Victoria Island, Lekki, Ajah, amongst others, in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State due to storm water, ocean encroachment and heavy rainfalls, as several properties running into billions have been destroyed by floods causing displacement of families and even loss of lives,\u201d Obanikoro said.\n\nHe noted that Eti Osa LGA lies on the narrow coastal lowland of the south-eastern part of Lagos and situated on about 129.5 square kilometres of landmass, with sandy beaches, swamps, mangroves and creeks.\n\nThe lawmaker also noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Third Assessments Report (2001) asserted that climate change is most likely to have impacts on settlements in coastal or riverine locations, especially where rapid urbanisation is occurring alongside economies that are dependent on climate-sensitive resources.\n\nAccording to him, the development of official and residential estates along the coastal area of the Atlantic Ocean in Lagos State is a major problem that circumvents basic environmental principles, which should be adopted in planning coastal towns and cities.\n\nObanikoro said, \u201cThe House is worried that polar ice caps are already melting at an alarming rate with significant shifts being observed in the isoclines and ecosystems levels, thus leading to rapid changes in the coastal areas of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe House is also worried that the projected sea-level rise in the coastal areas of Lagos State could be more than one meter by 2100, which will result in ample loss of land to the sea, considering that Lafiaji community ocean surge which was about 420 feet is now about 100 feet; in Okun Ajah, the distance to sea was about 500 meters but it is now less than 40 meters, while Okun Alfa is down from 850 feet to 82 feet.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker further noted that the 2021 Annual Flood Outlook has predicted more flooding in Eti Osa.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This is a mission on which we cannot afford to fail.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said there must be a new and effective strategic thinking that should be at least two steps ahead of the current challenges, adding that the recent incidences at Custodial Centres are no longer internal insurrection by inmates but armed mass invasion from outside.\n\n\u201cA new strategy therefore must emerge to tackle these new challenges.Secondly is the issue of galvanizing resources \u2013human, financial and technology. The third concern is community policing\u201d, he stated.\n\nEarlier, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Dr Shuaib Belgore expressed his appreciation to the Minister and the Executive Course (SEC) 40, 2018 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) for the report and documents on Monitoring and Evaluation Framework on Internal Security which made President Buhari approve the Inter-Ministerial Committee.\n\nOther members of the Committee are drawn from the Office of the National Security Adviser ONSA, the Nigerian Navy, Army and Air Force, State Security Services SSS, Offices of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation OSGF, NIGCOMSAT, NIPSS among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

You are state agent, not LGA agent,\u201d the senior military officer replied.\n\n3:59PM\n\nBreaking: Gunmen Engage Joint Security Operatives in Gun Battle in Ihiala\n\nBy David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nGunmen suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the militant wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Tuesday afternoon engaged joint security operatives in a gun battle in Ihiala Local Government Area.\n\nThe attack came as the supplementary governorship election holding in Ihiala was under way.\n\nIt was gathered that the the gunmen were seeking to enter Ihiala through Imo State, as Mbosi and Orsumoghu where the attack happened are border towns with communities in Imo State.\n\nTHISDAY reporter who was covering the supplementary governorship election in Ihiala ran into a barricade set up by joint security operatives at Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction.\n\nThe joint security operatives comprising mobile policemen, Army, Navy and other security agencies stopped journalists, and after a brief search, turned the journalists back, disclosing that a gun battle was ongoing ahead.\n\nTwo unidentified police men and a soldier who spoke to our reporter said: \u201cYou have to go back for your own good. For three hours now, we have been exchanging fire with your IPOB brothers.\n\n\u201cOur men are in the bush now, and it will be risky for you to take this route,\u201d the security operatives advised journalists.\n\nWhen THISDAY reached the Anambra State commissioner of police, CP Echeng Eworo, he refused to confirm the development, asking that the reporter should call back later.\n\nTHISDAY also noticed a team of security men loaded in 10 Hilux vans, heading to Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction as reinforcement, as of the time of filing this report.\n\n3:17PM\n\nSupplementary Poll: Police Deny Alleged Killing by Soldiers By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Police in Anambra have denied knowledge of killing of anybody during the Anambra State Governorship Supplementary Election in Ihiala Local Government Area of the state. There were claims on social media that soldiers patrolling around the distribution/ Collation Centre at the Ihiala Local Government Headquarters reportedly shot dead a yet-to-be-identified man. When our correspondent visited the local government headquarters, those interviewed denied knowledge of the incident. When contacted on the telephone, the Zone 13 Police Headquarters Public Relations Officer , Nkeiru Nwode, said there was nothing like that before the police. She said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have such report and I don\u2019t think something like that happened.\u201d\n\n2:11PM SDP Candidate Votes, Decries Sluggish BVAS Accreditation By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Barr Obinna Uzor has voted in Umunnamehi Primary School, Ihiala ward one in the ongoing supplementary governorship election in Ihiala Local Government Area. Uzor said the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, in the area was sluggish, and that it was delaying the voting process. \u201cIt is only VIPs that when they can not be captured, they continue to wait to ensure that they eventually get captured and vote. \u201cBut the locals among us, once they cannot be captured, they just leave. We love technology, but INEC should fine-tune it. This can affect the outcome of the process,\u201d he said\n\n2:08PM Election Materials, Personnel Yet to Arrive Some Polling Centres in Ihiala\n\nThere were still unavailability of election materials at various polling units in the Anambra governorship supplementary election in Ihiala Local Government Area as at noon. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the election which was supposed to commence at 10am and end at 4pm has not started as election materials are yet to leave the local government headquarters. An Electoral Officer on duty said there were areas where electoral personnel refused to go to for security reasons. The officer, who preferred anonymity, identified the area as Lilu, Isseke, Orsumoghu, Ubuluisiuzo, Mbosi and Azia. The person said that development had escalated the situation in the area. Also, an official of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) had alleged that some corps members who were made available for the election were being replaced by non corps members. The official who refused to disclose its name, said the scheme deployed 1,000 corps to INEC for the Ihiala election but regretted that most of them were stranded and still loitering at the Secretariat.\n\n1:55PM\n\nAs Fingerprint Identification Fails, INEC Relies on Facial Verification to Accredit Voters By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka In Ihiala town, Ihiala Local Government Area, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC are depending on facial verification to accredit voters, using the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) An INEC official who spoke to journalists in Eziani Primary school, Ihiala ward one, polling unit 10 said: \u201cThe thumbprint is not functioning, but the facial verification is what we are using to issue out accreditation.\u201d The INEC technical officer in Ihiala Local Government Area however said it takes between 30 seconds to one minute to accredit one voter, and the process is progressing speedily.\n\n1:26Pm\n\nAnambra Deputy Speaker Says BVAS Working Perfectly By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Deputy Speaker of Anambra State House of Assembly, Hon Pascal Agbodike has hailed the functioning of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machine for its swiftness in accrediting voters in today\u2019s supplementary election in Ihiala Local Government Area. Agbodike who spoke to journalists after voting at Mbosi Girls Secondary School said the BVAS machine was functioning very smoothly. \u201cI have voted, and I have also observed voting in my ward, Mbosi ward 20, and I can say that the working of the BVAS is perfect for now. \u201cThings are going well and the BVAS is working from what I can attest for now. \u201cAnambra people are largely peaceful people, and you can see that everything is going on well. Whether election or not, our people are their brothers\u2019 keepers. Whatever you may have experienced is just because of politics. After the election we will all go back to being brothers as we have always been.\u201d\n\n1:08PM\n\nAnambra Supplementary Poll: Voting Under way in Ihiala\n\nBy David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nVoting has started in Ihiala Local government area, where the Supplementary election for Anambra Governorship election is taking place.\n\nA visit to Mbosi community, ward 20 showed that voting had started, with voters already casting their votes.\n\nA technical officer with the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC who spoke to our correspondent said the voting was going on well.\n\n\u201cWe started voting at about 12pm, and there is satisfactory level of turnout.\n\n\u201cThe Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machine is working perfectly today. We updated our software and today, it is not taking up to one minute to accredit one voter,\u201d she said.\n\n10:30am\n\nAll Eyes on Ihiala as INEC Concludes Anambra Governorship Election\n\n\u2022Adjusts voting timeline for supplementary poll \u2022APC alleges rigging, to contest result in Supreme Court \u2022State govt assures Ihiala people of security as billionaire sons, daughters mobilise indigenes in diaspora \u2022CLEEN Foundation seeks improvement in BVAS technology Chuks Okocha in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka With the supplementary poll in the Anambra State governorship election holding today in Ihiala Local Government Area, attention has shifted to the council area, just as interests have heightened among the various stakeholders. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has, in line with extant rules and regulations, announced a slight adjustment to the commencement and closing time for the supplementary election. INEC said polling would now commence at 10am and end at 4pm. The commission had on Sunday declared the November 6 off-time governorship election in Anambra State inconclusive owing to the suspension of voting in Ihiala Local Government Area on account of alleged irregularities. But the All Progressives Congress (APC) accused the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, and fellow party man and incumbent governor of the state, Willie Obiano, of rigging the election. However, the state government appealed to the people of Ihiala to come out en masse today to cast their votes, assuring them of adequate security. Meanwhile, CLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve on logistics and operational challenges associated with the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to deliver more transparent and credible elections. Ahead of today\u2019s voting, prominent sons and daughters of Ihiala had mobilise indigenes of the area at home and in the diaspora to vote in today\u2019s supplementary election. Last Saturday\u2019s governorship election was declared inconclusive after the exercise was cancelled in Ihiala. Though, Soludo had crossed the threshold requirement for victory after winning 18 out of the 21 local governments areas in the state. Despite the fact that Soludo was in apparent victory, the situation in Ihiala necessitated a supplementary poll to avoid disenfranchising the area\u2019s huge voting population of over 148, 000. Announcing the adjustment to the voting timeline for Ihiala, INEC said, in a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, \u201cWe urge political parties, voters, election duty officials, election observers, the media and the general public to note this slight modification. We also appeal to citizens to conduct themselves in an orderly manner to ensure that the election is brought to a peaceful conclusion.\u201d However, Chairman of APC in the state, Basil Ejidike, accused Soludo and Obiano of rigging while rejecting the results so far declared by INEC. It vowed to contest the results to the Supreme Court, if INEC went ahead to declare Soludo winner of the election. Ejidike said APC would never accept the election\u2019s outcome. He called for cancellation of the election. He stated, \u201cWe want the whole world to hear our voice that we will never accept the outcome of the Anambra gubernatorial election. The candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the sitting Governor, Willie Obiano, manipulated the whole electoral system and we will stand to resist it. \u201cWe virtually won in all the local governments, but Willie Obiano and Charles Soludo, through instrumentality, corrupt-minded INEC officers, subverted the whole process in favour of APGA. \u201cBut if INEC goes ahead to announce the results, we will definitely challenge the election process at the court of law, up to Supreme Court. Nobody can intimidate us.\u201d Ejidike also addressed a press conference in Awka. He said despite the party\u2019s protests, there were no truth in some press statements attributed to the party, and being circulated in the media. He said, \u201cThere have been too many information ascribed to us that is not true. Some people wrote whatever they liked and credited it to the party, when it didn\u2019t come from the party. One of them was the one that said APC has denounced the exercise, and called for cancellation, and the other was that we said we were heading to court to challenge the election. \u201cThere is another one that said that I collapsed, after hearing the result of my ward, where they claimed I lost. I want to make it clear that they were false information. None of them emanated from us. \u201cThe picture saying that I collapsed is false. My polling unit 002 bridgehead market, Onitsha, was won by APC. I had 95 per cent in the unit and even in my ward. If you look at the picture they are circulating, you will know that it has no resemblance of my person at all. Please, discard the information.\u201d But the state government assured the people of security through a public announcement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu. Chukwulobelu announced, \u201cThis is to inform the public, particularly, residents and voters in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Tuesday, 9th November, 2021 as the date for the 2021 Anambra Gubernatorial supplementary election for Ihiala local government area only. \u201cAnambra State Government, working with relevant security agencies, hereby assure Ndi Ihiala that adequate security arrangements have been made to protect life and property during the election. All are encouraged to come out and vote for the candidate of their choice. \u201cAs Ndi Ihiala may have observed, elections were successfully and peacefully held in the other 20 local government areas of Anambra State and INEC has duly announced the results. No incidence of violence or voter molestation was recorded in the Anambra gubernatorial election, which held on Saturday, 6th November 2021. \u201cAs a reminder, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had previously cancelled the sit-at-home order earlier announced and encouraged Ndi Anambra to come out and vote. Anambra will continue to remain the light of the nation.\u201d CLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve logistics and address operational challenges associated with the BVAS. The Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) noted that the election was visibly marred by logistics and operational challenges with regard to the distribution of election materials and late arrival of INEC officials at many of the polling units. The foundation stated that the challenges led to late opening of polling in some units, the extension of the polls from 2.30pm to 4.30pm, and subsequent disenfranchisement of some eligible voters due to unavailability of election materials and INEC officials. In a statement by Acting Executive Director, CLEEN Foundation, Ruth Olofin, the foundation recommended that INEC should conduct more voter awareness on the BVAS machine. CLEEN said, \u201cINEC result portal should be improved for more transparency and accountability through automation of the sum of votes received by political parties at the polling units; INEC should prosecute electoral offenders to serve as deterrent to others; \u201cINEC should provide enough sensitive materials, such as Braille for voters with visual impairment; the commission should train and retrain electoral officers and ad-hoc staff to enable them meet with the changing needs of the electorate in Nigeria.\u201d In related development, THISDAY gathered that prominent indigenes of Ihiala, who began mobilising to ensure large turn out of voters on Tuesday included Mr. Ernest Obiejesi, popularly known as Obijackson; chairman of Air Peace Airline, Allen Onyema; and Chairman of Seplat Oil, Dr. ABC Orjiakor, among others. Ihiala is reputed as the local government with the highest concentration of billionaires in Anambra State, after Nnewi, and it also boasts the second largest voting strength in the state, after Idemili North Local Government Area. The local government will today decide the fate of the major candidates in the governorship race, as 148,000 voters in the area go to the poll. Sources told THISDAY that the major candidates in the Anambra governorship election had shifted their attention to Ihiala, pressing to mobilise voters for themselves. It was further gathered that many voters from Ihiala, who resided in other towns, had been coming home since noon yesterday, in preparation for today\u2019s poll. \u201cSome of our brothers, who live in Lagos and Abuja, have already arrived by air, on the sponsorship of some of our billionaires,\u201d a source said. Obiano, too, was alleged to be pressing some of the notable figures in the state to work for APGA and ensure that Soludo won the election. Soludo is currently leading with about 45,000 votes, but with 148,000 votes still up for grabs, if the Ihiala people decide to favour PDP\u2019s candidate, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo or APC\u2019s Senator Andy Uba, they could comfortably make anyone of them the next governor of the state. But a source said Onyema was already working hard to ensure Soludo emerged victorious. Not unexpectedly, the governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Nze Akachukwu Nwankpo, has withdrawn from the race and thrown his weight behind Soludo. Nwankpo, after allegedly consulting with his party leadership, elected to support Soludo. The ADC candidate said, \u201cToday, by 18.46 pm, I and my wife, Bar. Obiageli Nwankpo, spoke with Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, the gubernatorial candidate of APGA and congratulated him for a hard fought election and, in fact, conceded to him the title of the next governor of Anambra State. \u201cMy dear friend and brother, I have studied the trend of this election and seen clearly that the people of Anambra State want you to lead a deep seated effort to reform and rebuild our state. Anambra State must now become a state run on the basis of the will and desire of our people. I add my voice in calling the people of Ihiala Local Government to rise up and resoundingly end this election by massively voting for Soludo. \u201cLet there be no doubt that Ihiala LGA stands where the rest of Anambra State stands.

(NAN)\n\n7:03PM\n\nAnambra Election: Counting of Votes Under way Counting of votes has started in some polling units in Awka township after Saturday governorship election in Anambra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that though voting began late in some polling units in Awka, the exercise was concluded about 3.30pm.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner. Nkwachukwu Orji said that this revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am. In line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, adding that any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. He said all Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive. According to him, \u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem. \u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission. With this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised. \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. \u201cThe Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case bases. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission. \u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d, he stated.\n\n3:43PM\n\nAnambra Guber: INEC Extends Voting by One Hour Voting continues Sunday David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the Anambra governorship election.

          "title": "How to secure funding for your early-stage startup in Africa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Lemonade Finance raises money to ease diaspora remittances",
          "text": "Despite multiple international remittance products available for Africans to move money in and out of the continent, processing international payments is still far from painless.\n\nThat\u2019s why Lemonade Finance, a Nigerian startup that wants to ease the payment process for Africans in North America and Europe, was founded.\n\nTo extend its services to more Africans in the diaspora, the startup has just raised $725,000 in pre-seed funding, with participation from Y Combinator and the venture capital firms, Microtraction, Ventures Platform and Acuity Venture Partners, among several other individual investors.\n\nFounded in October 2020 by Ridwan Olalere, who left his job as Country Head of Uber Nigeria, and Rian Cochran, former Director of Finance at Opera Software AS, Lemonade Finance was built to be \u201ca borderless money app for Africans\u201d.\n\nOne of its investors, Dayo Koleowo, Managing Partner at Microtraction, says \u201cLemonade\u2019s solution is very timely. As a multi-currency financial service provider, they make it easy for the African diaspora to send and receive money from their new country of residence, which is remarkable. We believe Rian and Ridwan have the technical and financial know-how to provide the number one cross-border neobank for Africans in the diaspora.\u201d\n\nDo we need yet another remittance solution?\n\nWhen Africans want to send or receive money to or from their family, dependents, children studying overseas, or businesses domiciled in Africa, they have few options and encounter problems.\n\nBefore Lemonade, Western Union, PayPal and MoneyGram are some of the products Africans already use to process payments. But these options are typically expensive, take weeks to process payments and restrict customers from certain locations from using their services. For example, PayPal allows Africans living in Africa to receive but not send money.\n\nWith Lemonade, users do not have to go to the bank, and within minutes, they can send and receive payment.\n\nAfricans need access to more than one currency\n\nTo allow Africans to use their money seamlessly, Lemonade Finance has provided them with access to currencies that matter to them, notably the currency of the country they are in and that of their home country.\n\nThis is a big deal for Africans in the diaspora who have businesses in Africa but want to move their money in foreign currencies. Currently, if an African wants to change their foreign currency to that of the home currency in order to, for example, pay for their parents\u2019 healthcare, they have to deal with unfavourable rates and the length of time it takes for the exchange to take place.\n\nOlalere and Cochran say that the flexible solution Lemonade provides is intentional and at the core of the team\u2019s thinking in building the app.\n\n\u201cBefore now, when Africans living in Africa moved to the diaspora, they could only create a bank account with the currency of their new country or the US dollar. While some can use their phone numbers to operate an African bank account, like with Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), others have to travel back home to renew their token,\u201d said Olalere.\n\nImage source: Lemonade Finance\n\nLemonade Finance wants to ensure that a Nigerian who resides in the UK, for instance, can open a Nigerian account and save money in naira as well as pounds without leaving the UK.\n\nLemonade Finance faces regulatory and compliance problems. The startup has to go the extra mile to prove they are worthy of licenses in European and North American countries. This is because global banks have put African countries on a restricted list, preventing individuals and payments companies from sending money to Africa.\n\nBut Lemonade Finance is dedicated to letting global banks know that lowering financial barriers into Africa is a beneficial and strategic move. They have been able to get some of their partner banks to green-light Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon and some other West African countries. Yet, even as these global banks have enabled this financial access, they charge customers making transactions to African countries a higher fee. They also place restrictions on the number of days or hours it takes for the money to reach Africa.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, what we are constantly doing is fighting for everyday Africans to be globally included financially,\u201d Olalere said.\n\nOlalere revealed that the company\u2019s biggest milestone happened earlier this year when they acquired a license in the UK, approved by the FCA, without stepping foot in the UK.\n\nThis is why this funding round, according to Olalere, is important. It will help them upgrade and get new licences like the VMI license that allows them to hold wallets. This funding round will also help them hire for roles in the regulatory and compliance department, which will ultimately increase their customer base and allow them to reduce fees for customers.\n\nCurrently, Lemonade Finance is only live in Canada, where it has gained thousands of customers already. In a few weeks, it will allow users in the UK to send and receive money from Ghana and Kenya; and in December, users in the US will be able to send and receive money from over 10 African countries at once.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uninitiated usually think of Bitcoin whenever the word blockchain is mentioned.\n\nAnd they can be excused. After all, Bitcoin popularised blockchain technology. But there\u2019s more to it; blockchain has evolved, creating opportunities that are accessible to anyone in the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s complicated, and only the few who can find their way around the blockchain space are harnessing these opportunities.\n\nYele Bademosi, Founder and former CEO of crypto and cash payments company, Bundle Africa, wants to change this with his new company, Nestcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the company is also launching its first product, a crypto media platform \u2014 Breach.\n\nNestcoin wants to expose Africans to the benefits and possibilities of Blockchain.\n\nHowever, the idea for Nestcoin was in the works for a while and can be traced to a time when Bademosi knew next to nothing about crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYele Bademosi, CEO and Co-Founder, Nestcoin\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he revealed that his first contact with cryptocurrencies was in 2014. He met someone who had gotten Bitcoin as a gift, and he wanted to know what it was.\n\nBademosi did some research but still didn\u2019t give it much thought until 2017, when his Twitter feed was agog with this money-making phenomenon \u2014 Bitcoin.\n\nAdmittedly, his interest in Bitcoin was sparked by the possibility of making a lot of money, but that changed when he started reading tweets by AngelList Founder, Naval Ravikant, who explained the core of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cNaval described it as coordination, this idea that you could, without the need for a centralised authority, organise and coordinate millions of individuals and organisations at scale.\u201d\n\nBademosi realised crypto and blockchain are beyond trading and hodling. Bademosi sees it as a technology that could positively transform several sectors of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been driven personally to try to understand or figure out how we could kind of create alternative systems for economic coordination in Africa.\u201d\n\nBademosi (Nestcoin CEO) and Taiwo Orilogbon (Nestcoin CTO) are on a mission to make crypto accessible to Africans and transition Africa to a sustainable economy through crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwo Orilogbon, CTO, Nestcoin\n\nWhat is Nestcoin?\n\nAccording to Bademosi, Nestcoin is an umbrella company with several blockchain and crypto products. He added that it could also make investments in companies with a similar cause.\n\nEssentially, the goal of every Nestcoin product is to create simple platforms where Africans can interact with all things crypto as a way of creating economic value for themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s the business model?\n\nNestcoin will have varying products with different business models, but most will have native tokens, which will serve as a means of revenue generation.\n\nBademosi explained that in the decentralised world, there isn\u2019t really a need to charge a fee for services like traditional organisations.\n\nHe said incentives can be designed \u201cthrough the tokens that allows one to still benefit from the value created.\n\n\u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t have products that take a percentage or a fee, but generally, that\u2019s how we would like to design a lot of the products that we create.\n\n\u201cIt gives as much value to users in the ecosystem and keeps our fees or any spreads as low as possible.\u201d\n\nThe same model can be found in decentralised platforms such as Uniswap, an exchange on the Ethereum blockchain helping users swap tokens using the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nAlthough Uniswap takes fees from every transaction, it also generates revenue by issuing its own tokens.\n\nIs crypto secure enough?\n\nWhile the idea of decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO) or decentralised finance (DeFi) could provide Africans unfettered access to financial opportunities, there\u2019s still the question of safety.\n\nThe first DAO suffered a $150 million hack in 2016 due to loopholes in its infrastructure. Recently, Cream Finance, a DeFi platform, lost to a hack $130 million.\n\nTo assure safety, Bademosi said Nestcoin would only expose users to platforms that conduct regular security audits.\n\nHowever, the threat to crypto products or platforms doesn\u2019t end with security concerns; regulations also play an important role in their survival. In Nigeria, for example, the Central Bank restricted banks from facilitating crypto-based transactions.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, describes crypto as \u201cmoney out of thin air,\u201d expressing his distrust in the technology.\n\n\u201cFor us, we take regulation and compliance quite seriously,\u201d Bademosi said. He pointed out that there are crypto companies, such as Coinbase and FTX, that have shown that the crypto business can be regulatory-compliant.\n\nNevertheless, he holds the notion that governments should be pro-innovation.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that over time, people realise that crypto is a positive innovation for the world.\u201d\n\nNestcoin leads the way with Breach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinny Eze, Product Manager, Breach\n\nNestcoin is starting its mission with Breach, a globally-focused media platform that\u2019ll simplify crypto and blockchain concepts.\n\nAccording to Breach Product Manager, Chinny Eze, \u201cIt\u2019s a platform that breaks crypto concepts down into digestible bite-sized pieces for anyone to understand.\u201d\n\nShe says Breach will set itself apart from other crypto media platforms, with a new level of simplicity geared towards millennials and Gen Zs.\n\nA Breach Community platform is also in the works. More than creating content for consumption, the Breach Community will be a space for creators to have direct contact with audiences, fostering a better understanding of the concepts.\n\nLeading the Breach team as Managing Editor is David Adeleke, who doubles as Nestcoin\u2019s Communications Lead.\n\nAdeleke has held roles at media companies such as TechCabal, Techpoint Africa, and Ventures Africa.\n\nInterestingly, Breach will also have its native token \u2014 Breach token. Eze says the token is currently in the product roadmap, and the community will play an important role in its use.\n\nMore Nestcoin products?\n\nWhile Breach leads the way as the first in several products, Nestcoin will roll out more products with time.\n\nSome exciting products include a gaming platform where gamers earn in cryptocurrency and an NFT platform.\n\nFinancial products could also be in the works, as Bademosi said that when it comes to crypto, he truly cares about economic opportunities.\n\nHe believes that a person\u2019s geographical location should not determine access or the quality of financial services they get, a problem he\u2019s sure crypto will solve.\n\n\u201cI really believe that making crypto accessible for everybody in Africa and frontier markets is a worthy goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What MTN, Airtel PSB licence approval could mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 8, 2021, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nSubject to meeting specific requirements over the next six months, the telecom operators would receive approval to operate PSBs. As expected, the announcements were greeted with support by Nigerians and hailed as an essential step in deepening financial inclusion in the country.\n\nSo what does this mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria? This article provides some answers but first, what are PSBs?\n\nAccording to Mondaq, payment service banks accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, MTN and Airtel would provide these services if they get the final approval. In doing so, they would be joining the likes of OPay and Paga in that space.\n\nSince 2012, an often-stated goal of the CBN has been to deepen financial inclusion in the country.\n\nThe World Bank defines financial inclusion as access to valuable and affordable financial products and services delivered responsibly and sustainably. These services include payments, savings, credit, insurance, and transactions.\n\nIt goes on to say that having a transaction account is the first step towards financial inclusion, as it provides individuals and businesses with a way to receive, send, and store money.\n\nConsequently, while the telcos would not offer a full suite of financial services, they would be able to provide users with an entry into the financial system.\n\nA significant reason for the optimism shown is the potential of telcos to fast-track the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goal. This is mainly due to their comprehensive coverage of the country, especially in rural areas that house most of the unbanked population.\n\nWith the infrastructural cost of setting up branches and security, banks are not opening branches in new locations and, in some cases, are shutting down operations. According to the International Monetary Fund, Nigerian banks closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in 2020, bringing the number of banks in Nigeria to 5,158 in 2020 from 5,392 in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, MTN and Airtel have the largest and third-largest subscribers at 67.5 million and 42 million, respectively. Even accounting for multiple SIM cards as is common in the country, those figures are significantly higher than the top three Nigerian banks by customer base. According to data from the GSM Association, there were 97.5 million unique mobile subscribers in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) puts the number of bank accounts in Nigeria at 160 million as of May 2021. At the same time, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) reports 190,854,069 active lines as of September 2021.\n\nHowever, the total BVN count as of October 31 was 50,728,469. Given that no one can have more than one BVN, it is safe to assume that the number of bank account holders in Nigeria is around the 50 million mark.\n\nWith the World Population Review putting the population of Nigerians over the age of 18 at 105,841,979, we could infer that there are about 55 million adult Nigerians without a bank account. This presents a huge opportunity for the new entrants and the millions of unbanked Nigerians.\n\nHaving successfully set up mobile money services in other parts of Africa, MTN and Airtel could replicate the success in Nigeria. This development bodes well for Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population as it would serve as a gateway into the financial services sector. While the PSBs cannot give loans, having a transaction account enables their users to access loans for their businesses and education.\n\nGranting PSB licences to the telcos is, however, just one step towards achieving financial inclusion. As we argued in a previous article, financial inclusion entails more than having a bank account.\n\nChallenges such as a lack of a unified identification system and increasing poverty rates remain. Opening an account is one thing but consistently funding that account is another. Admittedly, this is not a task for the telcos but is one they are bound to encounter.\n\nThere is no doubt that granting these telcos a PSB licence would boost the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goals. However, for it to be truly impactful, it must go beyond adding numbers to the financial system to create tangible value for existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "One month after resident doctors in public hospitals across Nigeria called off a nine-week strike over poor pay, Nigeria has joined 49 others at the ongoing COP 26 Climate summit in the UK in pledging to cut greenhouse-gas emissions across its health systems, a move that sounds hollow in a country doctors still conduct surgeries using candlelight.\n\nExperts say the healthcare industry contributes about 4-5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. These countries have committed to lower their emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is warming the world, across their health systems. 14 countries have pledged to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions before 2050. This appears like a strange company for a country whose president goes for medical check-ups abroad.\n\n\u201cResilience of health systems is incredibly important. It is also true that as part of a green recovery from COVID-19, we need to recognise the role of health systems as emitters accounting for 4-5 percent of global emissions,\u201d said Rachel Levine, US assistant secretary for health.\n\nAccording to Levine, as part of COP 26 health programmes, countries were asked to commit to publish a plan sending out how they would develop their health systems, to minimise carbon emissions and air pollution, based on a baseline assessment of the health systems greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRead Also: Soaring e-waste affects the health of millions of children, WHO warns\n\nHealth emission\n\nIn a country where public hospitals lack stable electricity and doctors\u2019 strikes are just suspended until the next one, where drugs are available based on the goodwill of donors, and where salaries of lawmakers are prioritised over funding primary healthcare centres, it is uncertain how the country can mobilise the financing required to upgrade its creaking healthcare.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has visited hospitals in the United Kingdom seven times since he was sworn into office on May 29, 2015, and has spent over 200 days in London hospitals for medical treatment.\n\nIt took a pandemic for the secretary to the Nigerian government, Boss Mustapha, to notice the pitiful state of Nigeria\u2019s public hospitals. Appointed to head the government\u2019s taskforce, Mustapha was forced to confront the reality of hospitals without power to store vaccines or paracetamol to administer to patients reacting to AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for sure, I never knew that our entire healthcare infrastructure was in the state in which it is. Until I was appointed to do this work,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Nigeria has the poorest people in the world, the lifestyle of its leaders often belies this fact as they commute to hospitals in the UK and the US to treat a cold.\n\nNigeria allocates less than 5 percent of its Federal budget to the health sector, of these over 60 percent often goes to paying salaries. With over 400, 000 cancer patients according to data from the Global burden of disease, Nigeria has less than 10 radiotherapy machines.\n\nNigeria and other African Union member states met in Abuja, in April 2001 and committed to allocating 15 percent of their government budgets to health. This commitment is called the \u2018Abuja Declaration\u2019 and African governments reference it in health sector goals and policy documents.\n\nHowever, according to an analysis of the Federal Ministry of Health and its agencies\u2019 budgets between 2001 and 2021by the nonprofit Partnership for Advocacy in Child and Family Health (PACFaH), Nigeria had neglected to follow through on its promise, oftentimes barely reaching a third of the pledged target under the Abuja Declaration.\n\nNigeria\u2019s medical doctors are fleeing the country with a desperation that borders on mania. In the past three years, estimates show that over 2,000 medical doctors have left the country. There is approximately one doctor for every 6,000 Nigerians against the WHO recommendation of 1:600 ratio.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the country\u2019s pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the health sector by 2050, which will require building new and greener facilities at the same time as expanding health care coverage to millions, sounds like a pipe dream.\n\nIn an interview with Akin Abayomi, commissioner of health in the country\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos, he said the state government was constructing new hospitals that will be eco-friendly and retooling the current primary healthcare centres in partnership with the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on this as part of our One Health Paradigm that will ensure Lagosians live in a healthy environment and eats good food and not be stressed by the environment,\u201d said Abayomi.\n\nHowever, Lagos is not always the best benchmark for the Nigerian reality. N7 out of every N10 spent in Nigeria is consumed in Lagos, even though it is only home to 10 percent of the country\u2019s 200 million people.\n\nYet, the healthcare industry is a major driver of greenhouse emissions especially in the developed world and poor countries like Nigeria will depend massively on financing from rich nations to make a dent on their emissions pledge. Beyond making pledges, there\u2019s little in the form of policy and coherent plans that could guide Nigeria to meeting this target.\n\nGordon Brown, former prime minister of the UK, said climate change could consume more lives in years to come than COVID.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a system of global burden sharing where the richest countries that are responsible for the historic emissions and have the wealth and the capacity to pay, make good on the funding that is necessary for mitigation, adaptation and that includes the adaptation of healthcare systems particularity in the poorest parts of the world,\u201d said Brown.\n\nHe warned, \u201cIf we don\u2019t reach the target that we have set of $100 billion a year in climate finance, for developing countries, then we will deprive them of the opportunity not only to build coastal defenses, renewable industries but to build the healthcare systems that are necessary for resilience.\u201d\n\nRachel Levine said greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to increase as health systems develop and demographics changes increase healthcare demand.\n\n\u201cHealth systems also contribute to air pollution which is a critical driver of premature deaths and hospital emissions,\u201d Levine said.\n\nLevine said high emission countries must do more, and reduce emissions more quickly and while health sector emissions are lower, in low and middle income income countries, these are projected to increase at rates that will make Paris Agreement targets difficult to meet.\n\nAt the COP 26 Summit, pledges have come from high-income countries including the United States, Britain and Germany, as well as several low- and middle-income countries that are already among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as the Bahamas, Fiji and the Maldives.\n\nMany of the pledges represent initial commitments that will need to be bolstered with more specific details on how the goals might be achieved.\n\nCarrying out these commitments will require countries to significantly retool their health systems, to make them more efficient using clean energy.",

          "text": "The federal government has disclosed plans to float a National housing bond for real estate developers to address housing deficit in the country.\n\nSpeaking during the housing investment forum in Abuja on Tuesday, Patience Oniha, director general of Debt Management Office, noted that despite the multi faceted approach by government at all levels to address housing deficit, access to affordable housing has remained an issue of concern.\n\nAccording to her, factors including relatively high population growth rate, procedures for land acquisition and development, inadequate funding and access to funding as well as high cost of building have continued to challenge the effort towards provision of adequate housing infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nShe said, \u201cProvision of affordable housing has been at the front burner but it has not been addressed. Governments at the Federal and state levels have over the years enacted legislations, created institutions, licensed and actually built houses. These have not translated to adequate housing.\n\n\u201cThe funding options to consider at this point include; the existing structures and funding options such as the 30-year mortgage possible, with a sovereign 30-year FGN broadband refinancing offered by Nigerian mortgage refinancing company.\n\n\u201cThe other option is the National housing bond for private sector housing developers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the DG explained that with the NHB, the Federal government can access large capital from markets at a lower rate.\n\nShe explained that the deficit in the housing sector needs to be bridged with emphasis on affordable housing.\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola, Minister of Works and Housing, commending the efforts of relevant agencies towards addressing the nation\u2019s housing deficit, said that Nigeria currently needs a plan that is workable, accessible and sustainable to finance the housing deficit.\n\nRead also: Buhari approves new structure for Federal Housing Authority\n\nAccording to him, the ministry is willing to float the bond under a public-private- partnership.\n\n\u201cWhat we need now is a plan that is workable, accessible and sustainable to finance the housing deficit in Nigeria and to build the real housing economy that creates jobs and a sustainable career path,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmed Dangiwa, managing director, Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, in his remark said that the current reality in the housing finance sector demands a radical redirection towards creating a sustainable funding source.\n\n\u201cWe have realised long ago that the kind of funding we require and desire can only be gotten through a handshake with the capital market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of challenges we faced through FMBN issuance of N100 billion mortgage backed bonds for the acquisition of federal government houses allocated to civil servants as a result of the monetization policy in 2007.\n\n\u201cLessons from that endeavour must shop and guide our steps towards a successful outing for the National housing bond,\u201d he said.\n\nZainab Ahmed , Minister of Finance, Budget and National planning, noted that Nigeria\u2019s housing challenge presents itself in two forms, including the issue of new housing supply to meet the growing population and urban migration and renewing substandard housing which do not meet established standards.\n\nRepresenting the Minister, the MD of family home fund, Femi Adewole said that the proposed bond strategy would enhance access to housing finance and particularly deepen the participation of capital market in housing finance.\n\n\u201cThis objective of deepening the capital market in housing finance, recognises the fact that in the face of competing priorities, the government alone cannot meet the financial requirements of the housing market.\n\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the ministry of finance, budget and National planning welcome the idea of national housing bond being proposed.\n\n\u201cNational housing bonds in their various forms have delivered housing finance systems in several countries,\u201d she said.",

The walk was held as part of activities to commemorate the recent International Day of the Girl Child.\n\nThe official said; \u201cIn Nigeria, according to the 2018 NDHS, an overall 20 per cent of women aged 15-49 have been circumcised, down 5 per cent from the 2013 NDHS. Across the five UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme for the elimination of FGM intervention states, FGM prevalence for women aged 15-49 is on a downward slope, although it is still unacceptably high across the states like Edo, Delta, Ekiti and Ondo.\u201d She did not indicate if the assessment is still valid for 2021.\n\nQuoting the NDHS 2013/2018 statistics, she said in Osun State, the prevalence of FGM reduced from 78 per cent to 45.9 per cent; Ebonyi: 74 per cent to 53.2 per cent; Gombe, 72 per cent to 57.9 per cent; Imo: 68 per cent to 61.7 per cent, and Oyo: 66 per cent to 31.1 per cent. Edo, Ondo, Ekiti and Delta were not included on this list.\n\nMs M\u00fcller urged Nigerian youths and the digital generation to \u201cdevelop skills to create quality contents; find, select and evaluate digital sources of information and use ICT to develop positive behavioural relationships that will contribute to the elimination of FGM in Nigeria\u201d. She added that the UNFPA is working with youth-led organisations to reach Nigerian adolescents with accurate sexual and reproductive health information through digital tools and technology.\n\nAlso present at the event was the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen. She hoped that the walk creates awareness that will reduce the rate of FGM practises. \u201cWe need to provide more education by increasing advocacy on the health danger posed on girls and women by the practice of FGM,\u201d the minister said, adding that; \u201cThe financial cost implication of treating complications on nation\u2019s economy and the degradation of women dignity is higher than investments on prevention.\u201d\n\nIn attendance also was Emmanuel Babayaro, Nigeria\u2019s football star, and 1996 Olympics Gold medalist, who urged civil society groups and non-governmental organisations to synergise, noting that collaborations would help them achieve their goals faster.\n\nThe convener of the event and President of WAVE Foundation, Lola Ibrahim, indicated measures that could help to eradicate the harmful practice in Nigeria.\n\nShe said these measures could include translation of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP) into local languages, careful choice of words during sensitisation, and social services support for FGM survivors by the government at all levels.\n\nFGM comprises any cutting that has to do with partial or total removal of the external genitalia or related injuries to the female genital organs for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons.\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation, FGM has no health benefits and it harms girls and women causing trauma, pain, bleeding, infections, vaginal fistula and death in some cases.\n\n...",

          "text": "Gombe State governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, has blamed its recent political rift with Senator Danjuma Goje, a former governor of the state on alleged insistence by the latter to control him.\n\nAnswering questions from correspondents at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Tuesday, Yahaya said the former governor who had told his ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) that he trusted the governor to do good had now turned around to demand that things be done in the old ways.\n\nThe governor said he will not tolerate such an attitude from Goje.\n\n\u201cWell, the party has its principles and that\u2019s what obtains in every party and that of Gombe cannot be different,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a party, during our convention, we agreed to use consensus and Goje himself told the party members that he trusts me; that I will do the right thing peacefully and I have been doing my best for our party.\n\n\u201cBut for him to later call me aside and say we should only do what he says, that is what I will not do and will not tolerate.\u201d\n\nThe governor blamed the recent political clashes in the state on Goje who he accused of importing thugs, but assured that the security situation in Gombe state has now normalised.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in my State is calm now and people are going about their normal activities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue we had before now was caused by a former Governor of the State, Danjuma Goje, a serving Senator, who you all know.\n\n\u201cHe tried causing mayhem, and the people resisted that but as a result of the skirmish that ensued, lives were lost and some people\u2019s properties were destroyed. That is what we as a government are kicking against.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows he was the one that brought the killer thugs known as Kalare in Gombe but as the Governor of the State, I will not tolerate Kalare and whoever is involved in Kalare activities, no matter how highly placed, we will stop him and we will end Kalare by the Grace of God.\u201d\n\nOn Goje\u2019s accusation that some officials of Gombe state government are threatening his life, which he had now reported to security agencies, the governor said: \u201cThey authorities concerned will find out the truth since he has reported so that the matter would be investigated. Let\u2019s wait for the outcome of the investigation but whoever knows the history of Gombe knows who Goje is and they know who Inuwa is. People know the difference between us.\u201d\n\nOn why they could not settle their differences, the governor affirmed that settlement can only be reached when the other party is willing to listen.\n\nHe further stated: \u201cIf someone is in his right senses and can carefully listen to the people, he will do the right thing. What he wants to do now is to continue with his old way of doing things while I and my government will not tolerate that at all and that is what led to the current problem.\n\n\u201cHe is an elder; he should be the one cautioning anyone trying to ferment trouble not instigating it because of his selfish reasons.\u201d\n\nOn whether he would blame the political crisis in Gombe on Goje, he retorted: \u201cOf course, everybody knows that,\u201d adding: \u201cI will try my best because he is insisting on having his way and I am doing same, but there is God who knows everything and the society itself can judge but God is with the one who says the truth and does the right thing.\u201d\n\nOn the speculation that the crisis is related to the 2023 election, the ho governor remarked: \u201cWell, what you need to know is that only God knows tomorrow. Both I and Goje don\u2019t know if we will see the year 2023.\n\n\u201cMy major aim is to stand firm and fulfil the pledges I made to the people in line with my oath of office as well as bring about development in our State, with peace and tranquillity prevailing because, without peace, there wouldn\u2019t be development.\u201d",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya administration in Gombe State, has provided detailed breakdown of the state\u2019s finances, providing records of it\u2019s assets and obligations, amid accusations of financial misappropriation by the opposition figures in the state.\n\nYahaya whose government has continued to embark on several developmental projects, including Gombe Ultramodern Mega Park, started his predecessor, health facilities, roads and bridges across the state, noted in a statement by Mr. Julius Ishaya Lepes, Commissioner for Information and Culture, that setting the records straight with respect to the state\u2019s finances, became necessary in order to present the facts to the people of the state and other Nigerians on the state of its finances in view of the recent proxy attacks on the current administration, \u201cone whose achievements in just a little over two years of its existence, have been giving some unpatriotic elements in the state and beyond sleepless nights.\u201d\n\nAccording to commissioner, \u201cthe stock in trade of this crop of people, hiding under the guise of media and parading themselves as champions of the people in a rather mischievous and clueless manner, using every means available to blackmail the Gombe State Government, particularly Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya whose superlative performance goes beyond their imagination.\n\n\u201cThis could only be the handiwork of those who have lost relevance in the politics and scheme of things in Gombe State and have therefore chosen to take the path of perdition. However their days of mischief are numbered, and the good people of Gombe State know who they are. Any attempt to hide under any guise will not work as their identities are well known. It is rather a pity that some faceless groups suddenly sprang up all in the name of attacking the Gombe State Government. Soon, we shall unmask the sponsors and shame them in the public.\u201d\n\nProviding a detailed report of the state\u2019s finances, Mr. Lepes said: \u201cTo set the records straight, the current administration under the leadership of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya came into being on May 29, 2019 having won the elections with an unprecedented number of votes, the highest by any elected Governor in the history of the state. Upon assumption of office, the administration was confronted with an empty treasury and a burden of over N124 billion in Loans/Bonds, Pension/Gratuity arrears and contractors\u2019 liabilities.\n\n\u201cOne aspect of the financial burden inherited by the Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya administration include in part the following facilities listed below:\n\nS/N\n\nFACILITY TYPE\n\nAMOUNT\n\nTENURE\n\nPURPOSE\n\nMONTHLY RENTAL\n\nREMARKS\n\n1\n\nBOND\n\n20BN\n\n7 YEARS\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\n260.4M\n\nEXPIRES 2023\n\n2\n\nBOND\n\n5BN\n\n7 YEARS\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\n101.M\n\nEXPIRES 2022\n\n3\n\nFGN BAIL OUT\n\n11BN\n\n20 YEARS\n\nPAYMENT OF SALARY/GRATUITY ARREARS\n\n97M\n\nEXPIRES 2035.

More worrisome is the fact that these loans were not utilized by the previous administration for the purposes they were obtained. Due to its determination and the desire to uplift the living conditions of our senior citizens, the current administration has cleared over N2.4bn gratuity arrears and is still poised to pay another tranche by December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe inherited bonds raised by the past administration cumulatively in the sum of 25bn as earlier mentioned for infrastructure were spent without completing most of the projects. This can be seen from the table below:\n\nS/N\n\nPROJECT NAME\n\nPROJECT COST\n\nSTAGE OF COMPLETION\n\nPROJECT FINANCING\n\nCOMPLETION PERIOD\n\nAMOUNT ALLOCATED FROM BOND\n\n1\n\nMEGA MOTOR PARK\n\n6,028BN\n\n37%\n\nBONDS\n\n1 AND 2\n\n52 WEEKS\n\n2,674BN\n\n2\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTRE\n\n4.282BN\n\n80%\n\nBOND 2\n\n30 WEEKS\n\n300M\n\n3\n\nSCHOOL OF NURSING DUKKU\n\n2,274BN\n\n45%\n\nBOND 1\n\n52 WEEKS\n\n1,204BN\n\n4\n\nGSUST KUMO\n\n2,219BN\n\n40%\n\nBOND 1\n\n40 WEEKS\n\n2.219BN\n\n5\n\nREGIONAL ROADS\n\n4,765BN\n\n25%\n\nBOND 1\n\n56 WEEKS\n\n2,781BN\n\n6\n\nTANKER BAY\n\n816M\n\n80%\n\nBOND 2\n\n26 WEEKS\n\n300M\n\n\u201cFrom the above, it is clear that all the projects initiated by the past administration between 2012 and 2013 were not completed at the time the administration handed over in 2019, giving credence to the fact most of the funds were either misappropriated or misapplied. This goes to show the recklessness and cluelessness of the past administration. These projects need to be completed otherwise they will be left to rot away thereby losing all the funds while the present administration contends with paying the bond holders. Already, the Mega Motor Park is costing the state about N3bn to complete. The nagging question for all to answer, therefore, is how do we complete these projects and save the state from colossal loss especially with economic downturn occasioned by the Covid 19 pandemic and its debilitating effects. A well thought out robust financial plan becomes inevitable!\n\n\u201cDespite the economic depression that has led to the devaluation of the naira and heightened inflation, the Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya government has been able to meet its obligations and is executing meaningful projects that are impacting positively on the lives of the citizenry. Prior to the MIY administration, between 2016 and 2019, the 11 LGA\u2019s had to borrow N1.3bn monthly to pay salaries. This administration had within the first three months of its coming stabilized the LGAs financially and are now able to pay their salaries and pensions as at when due on their own. The state government has also been consistent in the monthly payment of the new minimum wage salary even as this has increased the state\u2019s wage bill by over N2.85bn annually.\n\n\u201cBefore the assumption of office by Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya in 2019, Gombe metropolis and its environs were without portable water supply mainly due to the neglect of the water works and unpaid liabilities of over N5bn. The MIY administration swiftly responded by settling the outstanding liabilities. This has guaranteed the restoration of adequate supply of water to Gombe metropolis and its environs with the pumping of about 50m litres of water daily.\n\n\u201cThe writer cited a 12BN facility obtained by this administration but blatantly refused to acknowledge the present government\u2019s giant stride in the provision of critical infrastructure especially the completion of the abandoned regional and township roads, due to lack of funding by the last administration, such as the 25km Billiri- Gujba road, the 15KM Sabon layi-Ayaba road, the 15km Ladongar \u2013 Fubawure road, the 17km Kumo \u2013 Kalshingi road, the 10km Kutare \u2013 Mona road, the 10km Kundulum \u2013 mallam inna \u2013 Kurba road and the 16km Marraraban Jarkwami \u2013 Daniya roads as well as the Industrial Cluster road networks. These projects have since been completed and are being enjoyed by the people. Other road projects being completed by the present administration under the same funding arrangement include Dukku \u2013 Kalam \u2013 Dokoro, Dukku \u2013 Jamari, Bambam \u2013 Tula \u2013 Yiri, Kwanar Rugaji \u2013 Kuka Bakwai \u2013 Galgaldu and Bajoga township roads among others. The MIY administration also initiated and completed the 15.2km Jabba \u2013 Garin Wada, the 21km Degri \u2013 Talasse and 16km Malala \u2013 Dukkuyel regional roads with the same funding. These are aside the township road projects in Gombe metropolis.\n\n\u201cAs it is a standard practice, funding of counterpart projects are done through bank facilities. The state has been transparently executing such projects for the benefit of the people. Over 340 classroom blocks have either been constructed or renovated and equipped with modern teaching and learning materials. The $2m NSHIP counterpart payment that facilitated the total overhaul of our 114 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) across 114 wards in the state was also part of this facility. So also the NEWMAP/WB erosion control project for N2.9bn which is completed and has greatly assisted in reducing the menace of erosion and flooding in the state capital especially in the Gombe State University to Mallam Inna area.\n\n\u201cThe Contractor Finance Facility (CFF), even though not a direct loan but a guarantee to the contractors was secured to ensure the provision of ultra-modern solar powered street lights on all our roads \u2013 both double and single lanes \u2013 totaling over 114km of roads, fund the biometric and attendance equipment contract for which hundreds of millions of naira has already been saved and the guaranteed balance will be assessed by competent contractors to complement the N2bn FGN health facility designed to help states upgrade their health facilities due to the Covid 19 pandemic. At present, a new N1.8bn General hospital is under construction in Kumo, while 3 other hospitals are being renovated and upgraded. These include Bajoga hospital (650m), Kaltungo (1.2bn) and kuri (118m).\n\n\u201cThe desire of the Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya administration to bequeath a better and more economically viable State brought about the idea to raise the N35bn Sukuk bond. A painstaking review and evaluation of our state of finances was undertaken. This revealed a funding gap that needed to be hedged in order to enable government deliver on its mandate. Again, the time value of money and low rates of interest played major roles in taking the decision. This is aside the need to ensure the completion of abandoned projects of the past administration. At present the debt-to-revenue ratio of the state is one of the lowest in the country at about 22% far less than the 73% of the federal Government. Recall that this ratio, due to the reckless misapplication of facilities by the last administration had over shot the 20% maximum limit and made it impossible for the present administration to adequately finance its projects. The review of the ratio to 40% now provided the window for the state to access funding. The proposed bond proceeds will be utilized to fund Phase 1 of the Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park, the Gombe Capital Special Development Zone, which will include a new state secretariat complex, a new state assembly complex and a new judiciary complex \u2013 a replica of the 3 arms zone in Abuja. Part of the proceeds will also be used for the expansion of the Gombe Regional Water Project for which the FGN is also making a 30% contribution in the over N7bn project. The bond is designed in a way that it will not to have any negative effect on the state throughout its term.\n\n\u201cThe desire of the present administration to provide social and affordable housing for the states\u2019 civil servants especially the low income earners as well as staff quarters in all health and educational institutions informed the need to key into the Federal Governments\u2019 Family homes fund initiative. This seeks to bridge the housing deficit in the country. Gombe like all other states of the federation seeks to access N5bn at very low concessional terms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the Federal Government in its bid to assist the sub nationals contend with the effect of repayments of the existing FGN facilities has extended a N18.7bn FGN intervention facility with a 30-year tenure and a 2-year moratorium. Recall that such interventions were earlier enjoyed by the past administration but were misappropriated as there is nothing to show for the huge sum of moneys they got including the huge Paris club refunds of about N24bn! The FGN\u2019s window of opportunity for a transparent and accountable government such as that of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya will greatly assist Gombe state to invest in more critical infrastructure that will stimulate growth and bring about economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cBorrowing is generally an accepted norm the world over in order to fund deficits, provide critical infrastructure and hedge against depreciation. The only downside is when it is misapplied or diverted from the original intent. That therefore should be the worry and concern of every indigene of Gombe. All facilities obtained must be tied to projects, budgeted for and utilized for the purpose they are meant for. Till date, no recurrent borrowings have been made by the present administration. Furthermore, the MIY administration has always followed due process and met all regulatory requirements in all its dealings with financial institution and will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cWith the strides achieved by the current administration, the state has attained national recognition from different credible rating agencies. These include; the best state in the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria; the Number 10 on the Transparency and Accountability index and Number 7 on Fiscal Responsibility index among others. The present administration has also succeeded in creating a clear roadmap and has placed Gombe State on the trajectory of sustainable development through the 10 year plan (DEVAGOM).\n\n\u201cThe MIY administration takes seriously its covenant with the good people of Gombe and will not in any way betray the trust bestowed in it by the people but will only strive to exceed their expectations.\u201d",

          "text": "Non-governmental Organisation NGO, Yiaga Africa as voters in Ihiala Local Government Area, of Anambra State go for supplementary election on Tuesday, November 9 to elect their governor due to declaration of the inclusive governorship election in that part of the Stated by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, an election observer, Yiaga Africa, expressed concern over the framework for adopting new electoral technologies by INEC as a result of technical hiccups that affected the functioning of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, in the election on November 6.\n\nThis was stated by the Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, during a press briefing, while delivering the \u2018Preliminary Statement on the 2021 Anambra Gubernatorial Election\u2019 along with Board Member, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwagwu, and Director of Programme, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu.He said:\n\n\u201cIn its situational midday statement released on Saturday, November 6Yiaga Africa raised concerns on late deployment if polling officials and election materials, delayed opening of polls, non-functioning of BVAS and non-opening of polling units concentrated in Ihiala and Ogbaru Local Government Areas, LGAs.\n\n\u201cBy replacing Smart Card Readers with the BVAS, INEC intended to enhance the integrity of the electoral process by introducing additional checks to ensure only eligible voters could cast ballots on Election Day. The BVAS was used throughout the accreditation of voters in 95% of polling units. He said:\n\n\u201cIn its situational midday statement released on Saturday, November 6Yiaga Africa raised concerns on late deployment if polling officials and election materials, delayed opening of polls, non-functioning of BVAS and non-opening of polling units concentrated in Ihiala and Ogbaru Local Government Areas, LGAs.\n\n\u201cIn 45% of the polling units, the system malfunctioned at some point during the accreditation. The BVAS was replaced in 1% of the polling units and fixed in 39% of the polling units. In 5% of polling units, the BVAS malfunctioned but was not fixed or replaced. In 3% of polling units, the presiding officers resorted to manual accreditation of voters in contravention of INEC guidelines and regulations.\n\n\u201cYiaga called on INEC to tale necessary steps to ensure registered voters are not disenfranchised from voting to determine the next governor of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cLogistics heavily delayed the opening of polling units, despite innovations made in recent times to establish Super Registration Area Centres, RACs, close to the polling units to alleviate logistical problems.\n\n\u201cBVAS malfunctioned and slowed down the process. Yiaga Africa notes that the commission did not adhere to this procedure in the polling units where the BVAS did not accredit the voters.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa expresses concern with INEC\u2019s framework for adopting new electoral technologies, as the BVAS, though a valuable tool for electoral integrity, fell short of expectations.\u201d\n\nHowever, he Itodo affirmed that, \u201cWe support the BVAS device for electronic accreditation and transmission or upload of results we support that innovation.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are fundamental principles that govern the deployment of electoral technology. These devices are meant to improve the efficiency and transparency of the process.\n\n\u201cOur position is you can surrender your democracy to machines, and if you not going to do that there has to be a hybrid, biovocated approach provide manual and electronic means of conducting election processes. The BVAS should be supported and we support it.\n\n\u201cThere is a principle of transparency, when these devices were first introduced Yiaga Africa deployed observers to observe the Isoko North bye-election on September 11, 2021,there were two challenges we highlighted; the first was on the capacity gaps that we observed on the part of the operators and in this case the polling officials. The second were the tech-glitches, and in our pre-election statement we urged INEC to address those challenges.\n\n\u201cINEC cannot be deploying technologies that disenfranchises voters and it questions its commitment to participatory democracy, and as an institution it should prioritize these issues; the issue of fingerprint authentification was an issue with the Smart Card Reader, you introduce a new device we expect that these gaps will be addressed but they have not been addressed, but as stakeholders we would continue to hold INEC to higher standards because that is the responsibility that Yiaga Africa and other Civil Society Organisations have and it is in the best interest of our country.\n\n\u201cBut technologies or machines have vulnerabilities, we know that these machines are vulnerable but INEC needs to be more open with stakeholders to discuss these principles of integrity, transparency, accountability, efficiency, and these for us will be discussions that Yiaga Africa will lead over the next couple of weeks around the common the principles that should govern deployment of electoral technologies-issues on cost, infrastructure, digital security, public awareness in the use of technology.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on public access to election results, Yiaga Africa acknwoledged value of adopting new technologies to enhance the credibility of the electoral process, including the introduction of the INEC Results Viewing Portal IREV to improve the transparency of the results declared at the polling units.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa commends INEC for deploying the portal for the election and further recommends that INEC reviews the portal to make the interface user-friendly and provide electoral results data in a usable format to facilitate citizens\u2019 monitoring of the announcement of election results\u201d, he pointed.\n\nAccording to him, Yiaga Africa observers reported incidents of intimidation, harassment or violence towards women voters, polling officials, security, party agents or observers at seven per cent of polling units observed. Yiaga Africa also notes that in 26% of polling units observed, there were no female polling officials. Female presiding officers were sighted in only 38% of polling units.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa implores INEC and security agencies to ensure safety for women voters and for INEC to ensure gender parity in its deployment of officials in electoral processes\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Director of Programme, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, while reading recommendations contained in the statement, said on the Ihiala Local Government going for supplementary election on November 9, Yiaga Africa calls for transparency, and as a result INEC should publish total number of Permanent Voter Cards, PVC, collected in Ihiala LGA and also inform the public of number of uncollected PVCs.\n\nSanction its staff accused of electoral malpractice and conspiracy with political actors; INEC should terminate the contractual agreement with the National Union of Road Transport Workers for breach of contract, and legally tackle erring commercial drivers who failed to deliver electoral materials.\n\n\u201cTo enhance the transparency of the supplementary election, INEC should publish the total number of Permanent Voter Cards PVC collected in Ihiala LGA and inform the public on the status of uncollected PVCs.\n\n\u201cINEC should undertake an audit of the BVAS and ensure all the technological glitches with the device are resolved ahead of the supplementary elections to pre",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon.

          "title": "Nigeria Plans \u2018Operation Feed Yourself\u2019 To Tackle Malnutrition",
          "text": "The Federal Government is considering an \u2018Operation Feed Yourself\u2019 initiative to encourage the establishment of urban farms and small home gardens across the country.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo explained that the initiative, to be undertaken in collaboration with states under the auspices of the National Economic Council and the National Council on Nutrition, was part of efforts to address malnutrition and related challenges.\n\nThe plan for this initiative is one of three major plans arising from the UN-backed Food Systems Dialogues, to advance the fight against malnutrition, the Vice President stated at a high-level meeting on nutrition on Monday.\n\nOther plans, he added, were providing support to farmers across the country, especially by providing useful weather and soil pattern information that would improve farming yields, as well as encouraging state governments to ensure prompt release of budget for nutrition and related activities.\n\n\u201cThere are practical steps that can be taken by the states and Federal Government in the next 12 months,\u201d Professor Osinbajo told the meeting. \u201cI think that some of the suggestions are important, especially those that have come from the UN Food System Dialogue.\u201d\n\nBoost Food Security\n\nHe listed the different stages as the establishment of agribusiness investment hubs or farm settlements, the establishment of urban farms and homestead gardens by individuals and schools, the adoption of weather information to support farming, leveraging the support of the UN agencies and other partners for nutrition activities, and the call on MDAs and states to release funding for nutrition activities.\n\n\u201cStates and the FGN will promote what the convener has described as \u2018Operation Feed Yourself\u2019. This is more of the establishment of urban farms and homestead gardens,\u201d the Vice President stated. \u201cThis is simply something that we think should be a mass appeal to citizens in the states, and the encouragement we can give them so that individuals and schools develop their own farms or homestead gardens.\n\n\u201cThis obviously not only helps individuals and families, but the excess can be sold to others and generally improve food security. The establishment of agribusiness investment hubs or farm settlements or farm estates or any variety of those kinds of integrated farming arrangements will improve food and nutrition security.\n\n\u201cWhat we are recommending is the sort of model that Oyo State has or any of the variety that states have. That sort is obviously recommended because of the way that it is structured and the obviously good result that they have been getting.\u201d\n\nNutrition Budget\n\nSpeaking specifically about the funding of nutrition and related activities by MDAs and states, Professor Osinbajo said a point of importance had been made, even at the National Economic Council meetings.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the action points as defined in the food transformation pathways which we already have issued and we are hoping that these budget releases will be specifically directed at the action points defined in the transformation pathways because these are ways by which we have identified that we can gain maximum traction in food security,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWe urge the states to budget adequately for nutrition. Each MDA and state should adopt the national priority list, make budgetary provisions for those who haven\u2019t concluded their 2022 annual budgets. I think there is still time to make adequate budgetary provision for nutrition in the 2022 budgets.\u201d\n\nProfessor Osinbajo urged the state governments to adopt partnerships that can be effective in scaling up nutrition and related activities.\n\nHe said \u201cit is also clear that we can leverage on the support of the UN agencies and other partners like the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World Bank, as well as our development partners, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Aliko Dangote Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe Aliko Dangote Foundation was able to show what they have been doing, especially with de-risking facilities that could be used by farmers in the various localities all over the country.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was attended by the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Mrs Amina Mohammed, state governors, and representatives of development partners, among others.\n\nMrs Mohammed, who acknowledged the leadership of Nigeria to the UN agenda 2030 and the Africa Union agenda 2063, believes the solution to many of the challenges associated with malnutrition lie in Nigeria\u2019s recent commitment through the Food Systems Summit process.\n\n\u201cI will like to pay tribute to the leadership of the Vice President, Professor Osinbajo, and to the efforts of the Mrs Olusola Idowu, as the national convener of the virtual engagement by His Excellency at the pre-summit and clear, focused, ambitious national pathways that were published ahead of the Food Systems Summit in September,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt the summit itself, His Excellency, the President made decisive and inspiring commitments, and all these efforts of the emerging pathways, Nigeria has demonstrated a holistic approach to the food systems transformation which really underpins that transformation that it is about climate, it is about nutrition and about an inclusive economy.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, said despite dwindling financial resources, the states would continue to push on the frontier of improvement in nutritional issues.",

But, counsel for the second defendant, Babatunde Busari told the court that the copy of the proof of evidence on the case supplied to him by the prosecution wasn\u2019t legible and that a video clip which formed part of the proof of evidence wasn\u2019t audible.\n\nThe case was adjourned to Thursday, November 11 to enable the prosecution amend the court processes.\n\nFriends and associates of the deceased were also in court to observe the proceedings. One of them, Donald Oleah told journalists that they hoped justice will be served in the matter and vowed to follow the case through, no matter how long it takes.\n\nMiss Ojukwu and Mr Quadri are alleged to have conspired amongst themselves to murder the Super TV boss on June 15, 2021, at 19, Adewale Oshin Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, by stabbing him repeatedly with a knife in his neck and chest.\n\nThey were arraigned on eight counts bordering on murder, forgery and stealing.\n\nOne of Chidinma\u2019s relatives, Chioma Egbuchu, was also arraigned for being in possession of the late Mr Ataga\u2019s stolen iPhone 7, which was said to have been recovered from her.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the offences are punishable under Sections 222, 233, 280, 329, 365, 370, and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.",

          "text": "UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo has said the risk of Ethiopia \u201cdescending into widening civil war is only too real\u201d, adding that the political repercussions of \u201cintensifying violence in the wider region would be immense, compounding the many crises besetting the Horn of Africa\u201d.\n\nAddressing the Security Council on Monday, the UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs said, despite much speculation on how the Ethiopian crisis will unfold in the coming weeks, \u201cin a country of over 110 million people, over 90 different ethnic groups and 80 languages, no one can predict what continued fighting and insecurity will bring\u201d.\n\nShe said more than seven million people needed humanitarian assistance in northern Ethiopia alone, with an estimated 400,000 people in Tigray living in famine-like conditions.\n\nShe said, while some emergency supplies have been moved, it has been four months since the last big shipment of medicines and health supplies into Tigray which is home to about six million people.\n\nThe UN official said the report of the Joint Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights or OHCHR-Ethiopian Human Rights Commission investigation into the conflict in Tigray released last week shed light on the horrific suffering civilians have endured.\n\nThe report concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties to the conflict \u2013 including the Ethiopian National Defence Force, Eritrean Defence Force, Amhara Special Forces and allied militia on one side and Tigrayan forces on the other \u2013 committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. It also stated that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been also committed.\n\nDiCarlo said there must be an immediate cessation of hostilities, as called for by the UN secretary-general, African Union Commission chair, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) executive secretary, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, and the UN Security Council.\n\nShe said, \u201cEthiopia, a founding member of the United Nations, needs our support. We urge Ethiopians to come together to build a shared, prosperous future before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s conflict with the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) began a year ago and has accelerated in recent days, with a nationwide state of emergency declared last week and residents of the capital told to be ready to take up arms to defend residential areas.\n\nThousands have been killed and more than two million have fled their homes since last November, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against the TPLF, which had long run Tigray and was a main player in Ethiopia\u2019s national politics.\n\nTensions began to simmer when Abiy came to power in 2018 and sought to reduce its influence.\n\nSince the beginning of August, the conflict has spread from Tigray to the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara. Together with rebels of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), the TPLF has threatened to advance towards the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.\n\nTens of thousands of people have rallied in Addis Ababa in solidarity with the Abiy-led government.\n\nThe pleas for peace come as a new round of deadly attacks and forced conscription began against ethnic Tigrayans in an area of the country now controlled by Amhara regional authorities in collaboration with soldiers from neighbouring Eritrea, people fleeing over the border to Sudan told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the African Union High Representative for the Horn of Africa, Olusegun Obasanjo, said the crisis situation in northern Ethiopia had continued to drastically deteriorate in recent weeks, leading to a serious escalation of the situation.\n\nObasanjo, who is currently in Ethiopia, said he has been engaging with all stakeholders, including the prime minister and president of Ethiopia, in an effort to de-escalate the situation.\n\nObasanjo said the time is now for collective action in finding lasting solutions to avoid further escalation which may have a direct effect on the strategic security of the Horn of Africa region as a whole.\n\nHe urged the Council to consider strongly urging and encouraging the Federal Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray rebels to engage in political dialogue without any conditions.\n\nOn Monday, the US State Department said Washington believes there is a small window to work with the African Union to further efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict.\n\nUS Special Envoy Jeffrey Feltman visited Addis Ababa on Monday as part of diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.",

          "text": "Four astronauts strapped inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down safely in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida after a six-month scientific mission on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe Dragon vehicle, dubbed Endeavour, parachuted into the sea as planned just after 10:30pm local time on Monday (03:30GMT on Tuesday), following a fiery re-entry and descent that NASA streamed live.\n\nLive thermal video imaging captured a glimpse of the capsule streaking like a meteor through the night sky over the Gulf minutes before splashdown.\n\nThere was applause from the flight control centre as the four main parachutes inflated above the capsule, slowing its speed to about 24 kilometres per hour (15 miles per hour) before dropping gently into the calm sea.\n\n\u201cEndeavour, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home to planet Earth,\u201d flight control told the crew as a safe splashdown was confirmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be back,\u201d one of the astronauts radioed in reply.\n\nSince arriving at the ISS on April 24, the crew of two Americans, a Frenchman and one Japanese astronaut, conducted hundreds of experiments and helped upgrade the station\u2019s solar panels.\n\nTheir activities have included documenting the planet\u2019s surface to record human-caused changes and natural events, growing Hatch chilli peppers and studying worms to better understand human health changes in space.\n\nThe crew began their eight-hour return voyage to Earth in the Endeavour with a 90-minute loop around the ISS to take photographs, the first such mission since a Russian Soyuz spaceship performed a similar manoeuvre in 2018.\n\nThe Dragon, which flew mostly autonomously, has a small circular window at the top of its forward hatch through which the astronauts can point their cameras.\n\n\u201cProud to have represented France once again in space! Next stop, the Moon?\u201d tweeted Thomas Pesquet from the European Space Agency.\n\nThe capsule re-entered the atmosphere at more than 27,000km/h (about 17,000mph), during which crew communications were lost for several minutes.\n\nThe intense friction generated as the capsule plunges through the atmosphere also sends temperatures surrounding the outside of the vehicle soaring to 3,500F (1,927C), and a heat shield protects the capsule from incinerating on re-entry.\n\nRecovery vessels were shown headed towards the water-proof Crew Dragon as it bobbed upright in the water. The astronauts and their capsule were expected to be hoisted out of the sea within about an hour, NASA said.\n\nThe crew\u2019s departure was delayed by a day because of strong winds.\n\nBad weather and what NASA called a \u201cminor medical issue\u201d have also pushed back the launch of the next set of astronauts \u2013 the Crew-3 mission \u2013 which is now set to launch on Wednesday.\n\nUntil then, there will be only three astronauts on the ISS \u2013 two Russians and one American.",

          "text": "Warsaw accuses Minsk of trying to trigger a major confrontation along the frontier as months-long border crisis escalates.\n\nPoland says it has repelled an attempt by hundreds of migrants and refugees to enter the country from its eastern neighbour, Belarus, and said thousands of others were on the way.\n\nWarsaw said it had deployed additional soldiers, border guards and police in response to the situation along its eastern border, while video clips shared on social media purportedly showed people walking towards the frontier and some trying to breach a barbed-wire border fence using spades and other items.\n\nThe developments appeared to signal an escalation of a crisis that has been rumbling for months.\n\nThe European Union has accused Minsk of encouraging migrants from the Middle East and Africa to cross into the bloc via member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia from Belarus as a form of hybrid warfare in revenge for Western sanctions on longtime President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s government.\n\nLukashenko, who launched a crackdown on dissent in Belarus after winning a sixth term in a disputed presidential election held in August last year, has repeatedly denied those accusations.\n\nPoland said it had withstood the first attempts on Monday by those gathered along its border to force their way across the frontier.\n\nA video distributed by Polish authorities showed one man cutting part of a barbed-wire fence, another attacking the fence with a spade, while a Polish soldier sprayed an unidentified substance from a can.\n\n\u201cInterior ministry forces and soldiers managed to stop the first mass attempt to breach the border,\u201d Poland\u2019s defence ministry tweeted.\n\n\u201cMigrants have set up a camp in the Kuznica region. They are constantly guarded by Belarusian services.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier video, shared by the Belarusian blogging service NEXTA, people carrying rucksacks and wearing winter clothing were seen walking on the side of a highway. Other videos showed large groups sitting by the road and being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki.\n\nPolish government spokesman Piotr Muller told reporters that 3,000-4,000 migrants were near the Polish border.\n\n\u201cWe expect that there may be an escalation of this type of action on the Polish border in the near future, which will be of an armed nature,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Belarusian state border committee confirmed on Monday that many migrants and refugees were moving towards the Polish border. It also said Warsaw, which has stationed more than 12,000 troops in the region, was taking an \u201cinhumane attitude\u201d.\n\nLithuania, meanwhile, said it was moving additional troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible surge in attempted crossings from the latter, while Latvia described the situation as \u201calarming\u201d.\n\nThe EU vowed action in the face of what it said was a \u201chybrid threat\u201d.\n\nIn a statement later on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on member states to impose new sanctions against Belarus.\n\nThe use \u201cof migrants for political purposes is unacceptable\u201d, she said in a statement. Brussels would also look at how to sanction \u201cthird-country airlines\u201d that brought migrants to Belarus, she added.\n\nA statement from the US State Department called on the government in Belarus to \u201cimmediately halt its campaign of orchestrating and coercing irregular migrant flows across its borders into Europe\u201d.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Dominic Kane, reporting from the German city of Frankfurt an der Oder, on the country\u2019s border with Poland, said the developments at the Polish-Belarus border were of significance for the EU on two fronts.\n\n\u201cIt represents the two border issues with which the EU has to wrestle \u2013 the first one, its inner borders within member states, and the second one its outer borders, between member states and non-EU countries,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cThe EU wants to keep its borders within its member states wide open, but some of its borders, particularly with Belarus, very much more firmly under control,\u201d he added.\n\nExiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, meanwhile, urged a strong response from the EU and United Nations.\n\n\u201cBelarus\u2019 regime escalates the border crisis \u2013 migrants are pushed to EU border by armed men,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe migrant smuggling, violence & ill-treatment must stop.\u201d\n\nThe EU, the United States and United Kingdom all imposed sanctions on Belarus after Lukashenko unleashed a violent crackdown on mass protests following last year\u2019s presidential vote. All of Belarus\u2019s top opposition leaders are now either in prison or have fled the country.\n\nBut the 67-year-old, who has accused Western governments of having instigated the protests against him in the hope of fomenting a revolution, has so far withstood the penalties with the backing of ally and creditor Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended Minsk\u2019s handling of the border crisis, saying Belarus was taking all necessary measures to act legally.\n\nBut human rights groups have criticised both Poland and Belarus for their treatment of migrants and refugees, who face freezing weather conditions and a lack of food and medical attention.\n\nWarsaw has said at least seven people have died in the region since August, when the border crisis erupted. There have also been reports of more deaths on the Belarusian side of the frontier.",

          "text": "At least 26 schoolchildren have been killed when their classrooms made out of straw and wood were engulfed in a blaze in southern Niger a local governor told the AFP news agency.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have 26 dead and 13 injured, four of them seriously,\u201d said Chaibou Aboubacar, mayor of Maradi city, adding that the children were aged between five and six, according to AFP which reported the news of the blaze on Monday.\n\nNiger, one of the poorest countries in the world, has tried to fix shortages of school buildings by constructing thousands of straw and wood sheds to serve as classrooms, with children sometimes sitting on the ground.\n\nFires in the highly flammable classrooms are common but rarely result in casualties.\n\nHowever, 20 schoolchildren were burned to death in a school fire in a working-class district of Niamey in April.\n\nIssoufou Arzika, the secretary-general of the Niger Teachers\u2019 Union, told AFP that Monday\u2019s fire had \u201cdecimated\u201d the school in Maradi.\n\nArzika said his union had alerted officials to the danger of the straw and wood classrooms after the Niamey fire.\n\n\u201cIt is better to hold classes under trees than in straw huts, which have become flammable graves for pupils,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Mohamed Bazoum recently promised to replace the wooden structures.\n\nThe school fire comes days after at least 18 people died in a collapsed gold mine in Dan-Issa district in the north of the country.",
