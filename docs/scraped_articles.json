          "title": "Suspected cholera outbreak ravages Hausa communities in Ogun, Lagos",
          "text": "As cholera runs wild across the north, the infection seems to be spreading fast to other parts of the country, particularly the South West. LARA ADEJORO writes on the suspected cholera cases and deaths ravaging Hausa communities in Lagos and Ogun states\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, over 65,145 suspected cholera cases including 2,141 deaths have been reported from 23 states and FCT in 2021.\n\nThe spread of cholera infection across the country unfortunately is also happening at a time the nation is battling other public health challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and sporadic outbreaks of Lassa fever.\n\nWhile the surge in cholera cases has been predominant in the northern part of the country, PUNCH HealthWise findings revealed that a traveller from the north might have transmitted the disease to members of the Hausa community in the Magboro area of Ogun State. Scores of persons in the Magboro community are reported to have died after presenting with an ailment whose symptoms include stooling, vomiting and dehydration.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise findings also revealed an outbreak of gastroenteritis among the Hausa residents of the Mile 12 areas of Lagos.\n\nWhat is the diagnosis?\n\nThe Ogun state government said on Sunday that it was an outbreak of gastroenteritis.\n\nOur correspondent, however, confirmed from the Baale of the community, Modiu Adewole Ademuyiwa, Alalade Magboro of Akeran land, and residents of the area that it was an outbreak of cholera.\n\nIn a statement signed by Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, the Ogun State Government said the reported case of the outbreak is predominant among okada riders and scavengers in the Magboro area.\n\nAccording to the statement, the index case reported was of a patient that returned from a trip outside the state.\n\nThe statement also noted that the common public toilet used by people of the community has been linked to the transmission.\n\nHowever, a professor of public health, Tanimola Akande said cholera is one of the various types of gastroenteritis.\n\n\u201cIt is specifically caused by bacteria called vibrio cholerae. It presents with more severe vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n\u201cGastroenteritis presents as diarrhoea, vomiting abdominal cramps, nausea and sometimes with a fever. It is common in all seasons but epidemics occur in some seasons particularly in the wet season,\u201d he added.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise had reported that Lagos and Ogun communities are at risk of cholera, typhoid and other infections as open defecation and uncleanliness thrive.\n\nFrom the north to the west\n\nHowever, the outbreak of gastroenteritis is not limited to only the Magboro area of Ogun state.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise findings revealed that gastroenteritis cases in numbers are also now being reported at health facilities in the Mile 12 area of Lagos state.\n\nA visit to the Sawmill area where most of the Hausa residents stay confirmed this development.\n\nOur correspondent who visited the area also finds that the residents could be more at risk of the infection because of the unhygienic environment with many of them living in makeshift zinc and wooden structure without access to potable water.\n\nThe area is also overwhelmed by the waste products of its ever-growing population.\n\nHowever, the ever-busy area was deserted when our correspondent visited on Thursday. PUNCH HealthWise findings revealed that the fear-stricken Hausa settlers have been forced to flee the community in large numbers over the fear of the suspected cholera outbreak ravaging the area.\n\nIt was learnt that hundreds of people who are majorly the Hausa settlers travelled to their states.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Chairman of Hausa Community in the area, Musa Oseni said the state government officials had visited the area and advised the residents to report to the Magboro Primary Health Centre if they suspect any case.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that the people that died had cholera because they were stooling, vomiting, and were dehydrated before they eventually died.\n\n\u201cOne of them died last Friday and his family member that used to stay here has travelled to the village.\n\n\u201cI have heard that six people have died since Friday and Saturday and since then, no one has died, no one has been stooling,\u201d Oseni said.\n\nOur correspondent observed that the public toilet used by the Hausa community was under lock and key.\n\n\u201cThey said the medication is free. But many people have travelled back to their state. out of fear. More than a hundred people have travelled,\u201d Oseni added.\n\nAlso, another Hausa man at the Cele Bus-stop of the community, who identified himself as Muhammed said he heard about the outbreak but he was unbothered.\n\n\u201cAnything that wants to happen will happen, even if you are anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cI know people died but I am not going anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ladepo Duro-Ladipo, who is a resident in the area, said the sawmill area where the Hausa settlers stay is a spot of several activities.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of activities here but it\u2019s now turning to a ghost town. Ordinarily, if you come here you will see a huge crowd here and a lot of activities going on.\n\n\u201cBut one thing about this area is the poor hygiene. In fact, you will see that the gutters and the surrounding are dirty.\n\n\u201cThe dirty environment is of great concern for us as residents but they are not conscious of their health condition.\n\n\u201cEverybody is worried because everybody is vulnerable,\u201d Duro-Ladipo said.\n\nHowever, speaking with PUNCH HealthWise at the Magboro Community Primary Health Care Centre, a female official identified as Mrs. Idowu, said there has not been any confirmed case of cholera yet.\n\nShe, however, noted that cholera cases are being investigated, disclosing that officials from the World Health organisation have visited.\n\n\u201cAll the people that were affected did not come here for treatment except one Hausa man who came but he had been to another health facility before coming here.\n\n\u201cWhen he came, he was only weak and we treated him,\u201d she said.\n\nOffering to appease cholera\n\nMeanwhile, the baale in the community, Ademuyiwa, said it was the first time the community would record the infection.\n\nHe added that sacrifices have been made to curb the spread of the infection.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s one of them that travelled for the Eid-el-Kabir that brought the infection here.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to one of them, then it may transmit to others because they sit together and eat together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bale disclosed that about eight deaths were recorded so far between last Thursday and Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe officials from the Ministry of Health from Owode LGA and the Health Director from Abeokuta have been here with some medications and since Sunday, there has been no case of the infection.\n\n\u201cIt also killed three Yoruba women because some the abokis live with one of them.\n\n\u201cOnly two of the Hausa people were buried around Owode but they carried some back to their northern states.\n\n\u201cWe have created awareness among the people and urged them to embrace good hygiene practice. We also told them what to do if they suspect any case,\u201d he said.\n\nGastroenteritis hospitalisation rising in Lagos\n\nResidents at the Mile 12 area of Lagos said most people suffering from gastroenteritis were being treated at private hospitals and clinics and their exact number could not be ascertained.\n\nOur correspondent who visited some hospitals and clinics in the area gathered that no fewer than 22 people from the northern part of the country have been treated for the health condition since last Sunday.\n\nAt the Elim Convalescent Clinic, two persons were still receiving treatment when our correspondent visited on Thursday.\n\nThe medical doctor at the hospital, who identified himself as Dr. Balogun, said about 10 people have been admitted to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been coming since Sunday and we\u2019ve been treating them and we\u2019ve not recorded any casualty so far.\n\n\u201cWe can only say that we\u2019re treating gastroenteritis, they\u2019ve been stooling and vomiting.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t confirm if it\u2019s cholera. We\u2019ve discharged some and two are still here,\u201d Dr. Balogun said.\n\nHe added that officials from the state Ministry of Health, including the Local Surveillance Officer, have visited the hospital.\n\nAt the Al-Sadiq Memorial Medical Services, there were three patients receiving treatment when our correspondent visited. They were all members of the Hausa community.\n\nThe three of them were all looking pale, dehydrated, and weak.\n\nBut the MD of the hospital, Dr. Al-Sadiq Ozovehe said they are responding to treatment and would get better soon.\n\n\u201cSome of them are from Isheri or Ogun state but we\u2019ve treated not less than 10 of them but no casualty recorded,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the patients who identified himself as Aminu Musa said he doesn\u2019t know how he got the disease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just weak, my chest too is paining me. I was stooling and vomiting but I\u2019m feeling better,\u201d he said while coughing.\n\nAt the Healal Specialist Hospital, an unspecified number of people have been admitted and treated, according to PUNCH HealthWise findings.\n\nOne of the attending doctors who did not want his name mentioned said medics at the facility had been attending to patients with gastroenteritis since Sunday.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no cause for alarm, everything is under control and the government officials have visited the hospital but I can\u2019t give you details because I\u2019m not the only one attending to them,\u201d he said.\n\nCleanliness is better than sacrifice\n\nProf. Akande, who is also a former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria noted that gastroenteritis is caused by microbes (germs), viruses, and bacteria.\n\n\u201cIt is mainly through the feaco-oral route of transmission. It is spread through contaminated water and food. It can also spread through contaminated surfaces (fomites) particularly children who pick things and lick them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert added that gastroenteritis is largely preventable through proper hygiene.\n\n\u201cThis includes prevention of contamination of water sources and food and the prevention of houseflies from touching food. Frequent handwashing can equally prevent gastroenteritis.\n\n\u201cAlso, proper waste disposal is important for prevention.\u201d\n\nAccording to Akande, regular health education using various media on causes and prevention of gastroenteritis will increase awareness and help people to take proper action.\n\n\u201cPrevention of water and food contamination will curtail gastroenteritis. The government needs to ensure the provision of potable water and ensure environmental sanitation,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to get the opinion of the Lagos State Government was however not successful.\n\nOur correspondent called and messaged the Director, Public Affairs Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo, on Thursday evening, for comment. He did not respond.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Fully vaccinated people were 11 times less likely to die of COVID-19 and 10 times less likely to be hospitalised compared to the unvaccinated since highly contagious Delta became the most common variant, US health authorities said on Friday.\n\nThe data came from one of three new papers published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all of which underscored COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 ongoing effectiveness against severe outcomes.\n\nFor reasons that are not yet well understood, data from one of the studies suggest Moderna\u2019s vaccine has offered a slightly higher level of protection in the Delta period.\n\nIt comes a day after President Joe Biden announced an aggressive new immunization plan that includes requiring companies employing more than 100 people to either vaccinate their workers or test them weekly.\n\n\u201cAs we have shown in study after study, vaccination works,\u201d said CDC director Rochelle Walenksy during a press briefing on Friday.\n\nThe first study examined hundreds of thousands of cases in 13 US jurisdictions from April 4 \u2013 June 19, the period before Delta was dominant, and compared them to June 20 \u2013 July 17.\n\nBetween these periods, a vaccinated person\u2019s risk of COVID-19 infection rose slightly: from being 11 times less likely to be infected compared to an unvaccinated person, to five times less likely.\n\nProtection against hospitalisation and death remained more stable, but fell more among people aged 65 and above than for younger age groups.\n\nThe CDC and the Food and Drug Administration are assessing the need for booster shots, and it is likely the elderly will be among the first to receive them when the Biden administration starts to roll them out later this month.\n\nOne of the studies, which assessed vaccine effectiveness from June \u2013 August at more than 400 hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care clinics, stratified efficacy by brand.\n\nEfficacy against hospitalsation was highest for Moderna at 95 per cent; then Pfizer at 80 percent; and finally Johnson & Johnson at 60 per cent.\n\nOverall efficacy against hospitalisation was 86 per cent for all age groups but this fell to 76 per cent for those over 75.\n\nThe two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, have always performed slightly better than the J&J adenovirus vector vaccine \u2013 possibly because the latter is administered as one dose.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear why Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to have a slight edge on Pfizer in the Delta period.\n\nIt could be linked to its higher dosing level of 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms, or possibly the greater interval between the first and second shots (four versus three weeks), which might be associated with a heightened immune response.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Tordue Salem, Abuja\n\nA pressure group under the auspices of Bello Ambassadors Network, BAN, has commended the efforts of Governor Yahaya Bello in getting the Federal Government to list the area among oil-producing states of the federation.\n\nThe group gave the commendation Wednesday in Abuja, at a press conference by Mr Anthony Edogbo, it\u2019s National Coordinator, as it also called on the Kogi helmsman to run for the Presidency of the country.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cOnce more, the people of Kogi State have had one more reason to walk the streets with their shoulders high, as the state governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has established one more rhythm for the state and the whole north-central for seeing through the acknowledgement and revelation of the Kogi State as an oil-producing state \u2013 the first to accomplish the status throughout the entire existence of the country.\n\n\u201cBy now, it\u2019s valid to give kudos to every group or individual beckoning on the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello to declare his interest for the 2023 presidency. They have smartly assessed the governor and it appears their convictions and resolutions are justifiable. Bello\u2019s towering name in Nigerian politics provides the reason to ask him for more, for a bigger role.\n\n\u201cIn a letter dated August 24th, the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission wrote Kogi State, informing her regarding her new status in oil revenue. At the point when the report spread, many questioned it on the grounds that it was a case that has waited for more than 30 years of the establishment of Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe political doings of Governor Bello has given Kogites such countless things to gloat. Past being positioned as the most secure state in North Central Nigeria, Kogi has turned into an oil-producing state \u2013 this is a certain hint of the quick advancement the state has been situated to observe\u201d.\n\nThey stated that \u201cDespite the fact that a great deal of Nigerians have definitely known governor Bello for his canny moves, so many others are still left in the wonder of how judicious a youngster could be and his quick rising name in the nation\u2019s legislative issues.\n\n\u201cBello\u2019s astuteness and apportioning of advancement have become pointers to the new Nigeria going to be conceived. It shows a nation where youthful pioneers take astonishing actions to make something happen to benefit individuals\u201d.\n\nThey said \u201cWhile Bello\u2019s political foes keep on keeping tap and consistently stay at work to gouge his picture, many edified Nigerians, have kept on discovering love in the governor, as any desire for a superior nation are revived each day, through the developments of the governor.\n\n\u201cWe can at this point, not talk about Yahaya Bello as a political amateur, he has taken the central stage and has discovered a spot among the main chiefs, despite the fact that he came in just yesterday.\n\n\u201cBello drives the governors and has been the apparatus in the possession of the presidency for fixing certain national critical issues like the food barricade some time back.\n\n\u201cPresumably, Kogi won\u2019t ever continue as before again. Presumably, Nigerians yearn to have governor Yahaya Bello\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

They further emphasised that such statements could \u2018ignite disharmonious and acrmonious relationship within the polity\u201d.\n\nThe statement in full reads:\n\na. The Local Government Councils in the State are playing their legal roles and have been partnering with the State Government in delivering good governance to our people at the grassroots. Therefore under no guise can anyone allege that Abia State Local Government Councils will \u2018become a laughing stock\u2019.\n\nb. In the Local Government system in Abia State, we have never experienced any form of \u2018cabalism\u2019. All the Members of ALGON have been treated equally irrespective of the areas of the State they come from. Therefore, it is false for our chairman to talk about \u2018cabal\u2019 within the LG system in Abia State.\n\nc. On the issue of purchasing vehicles\u2026, we have never doubted the modus operandi for the procurement of the said vehicles. We have not seen any underhandedness in the process leading to the purchase. We have complete confidence in the process leading to their procurement and subsequent delivery.\n\nd. On the management of the Local Government resources, we refute the allegations of meddlesomenes by any external body.\n\nFrom the above, it is, indeed, very clear that the press release earlier made by our chairman was unilaterally made without the recourse, approval and authority from the sixteen (16) Local Government Chairmen.\n\nTherefore, having viewed with great concern these unwholesome activities of Hon Michael Ibe Nwoke, as highlighted above, which have fallen short of standard of the mandates of his office, we do hereby resolve as folows:\n\nWe pass a vote of no confidence on him as the ALGON Chairman We hereby unanimously vote for his removal from office as Abia State ALGON Chairman with immediate effect We will meet and elect a new Abia State ALGON chairman that will have the support of all members of the association for collective and smooth running of activities of Abia State ALGON That Hon Michael Ibe Nwoke is mandated to hand over all documents relating to the office of the Abia State ALGON Chairman to the Secretariat of the Association That, henceforth, nobody in the state should have any dealing with him in the name of Abia ALGON, as such actions will be viewed as a nullity.\n\nWe want to through this medium doubtlessly emphasise our unflinching support to the Kinetic Government and administration of the State and to further confirm our satisfaction in the decisions and policies of this administration which, in our humble view, are crafted and executed in utmost good faith and for the welfare of the generality of the people of the State.\n\nFinally, we condemn in totality the said press release by our (now removed) chairman as the issues raised are provocatively distasteful and can ignite disharmonious and acrimonious relationship within the polity. As leaders and stakeholders in the state, our actions and utterances should be one that should engender peace and love in the State and not anarchy and chaos.\n\nOn his part, the removed Abia State ALGON Chairman, Hon Michael Nwoke has pledged his support to the administration of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu saying, \u201cThere is no controversy; there is no issue. One of the mandates of all of us, the 17 Local Government Chairmen, is to support Okezie Ikpeazu\u2019s administration and that is what we are doing. So, there is no controversy; there is no issue.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki and Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha\n\nPeople living in the five states of the South-East are groaning over the frequent sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which they said, has continued to cripple socio-economic activities in the region.\n\nDespite the suspension of the Monday weekly order called by IPOB to push for the release of its leader Nnamdi Kanu, who had been in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS), South East residents have continued to comply with the weekly sit-at-home order.\n\nIPOB has since after the initial exercise on August 9, said that the order would be observed only on the days its leader is to appear in court.\n\nHowever, the fear of attacks has forced residents of cities, towns and villages in the region to stay at home in the last four Mondays. During the period, banks, markets, shopping malls, eateries and shops remained locked. Schools, mechanic workshops, recreational centres and churches were also under lock and key.\n\nThe whole thing took a new dimension as the pro-Biafra group declared a total lockdown on September 9, in protest of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Imo State.\n\nPeople said the issues of killings, beheading and burning of commercial buses linked to the enforcers of the sit-at-home order were enough reasons for them to stay at home to avoid being attacked.\n\nEvery sector has continued to bear the brunt of the frequent sit-at-home in the South East. The chambers of commerce, business owners and traders are still computing their losses, though they put the cost of every Monday sit-at-home at about N8billion.\n\nFirst Vice President of Nnewi Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NCCIMA), Chief Moses Ezukwo, said the development has robbed the zone over N50 billion so far; adding that the loss in the private sector amounted to over 60 per cent.\n\nOf this amount, unverified statistics said the transport sector loses at least N3billion any day there is lockdown in the region. An average of one million people move around, in and out of South East each day, at N3, 000 per traveller.\n\nA trader in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State lamented that the economy of the region was already collapsing.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are losing customers and businesses are declining. Monday is the first working day of the week. People set goals and hopefully look forward to achieving them. But currently, our hopes are being dashed every Monday. It is terrible. Something needs to be done urgently too.\u201d\n\nTransport companies have continued to suffer deadly blows. The major transport companies in Nigeria are largely owned by Igbo businessmen and women.\n\nAccording to them, they decided to close business every Monday because enforcers of the sit-at-home order allegedly targeted their vehicles, vandalised, and burnt them while also killing some of their passengers.\n\nFor instance, a truck laden with motor spare parts heading to Kogi State but parked at the Eluagu Obukpa area of Nsukka in Enugu State, was set ablaze by persons suspected to be enforcing the sit-at-home order in the early hours of Monday, September 6.\n\nA transport company manager in Owerri who wished not to be named, lamented: \u201cWe lost millions on that day the sit-at-home was first declared and moving into the fifth week, even though they have suspended it but our people are still very much afraid.\n\n\u201cGo around the transport companies and hear from them. Maybe many will not talk because of fear of attack. You talk today and tomorrow they will attack you. There is a need to stop this; our businesses are dying in Igboland.\u201d\n\nPresident General of Anambra State Market Amalgamated Association (ASMATA), Chief Ikechukwu Ekwegbalu alleged that hoodlums have hijacked the exercise.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Anambra State all the major markets opened for business but we did not see any trader or customer in the market. The entire markets were deserted due to fear of attack or robbery. We want to appeal to traders and customers to be coming to the markets because IPOB has suspended the sit-at-home order.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Wants to be remembered for stabilising nation\u2019s security, economy\n\n*Reiterates commitment to completing Second Niger Bridge, other projects\n\n*Promises credible elections in 2023\n\n*Ohaneze demands equity, justice, fairness for all citizens, says Ndigbo are most federating people in Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nIn his first working visit to Imo State since winning a second term, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said it was absurd to him that any Igbo man would be considering exiting Nigeria as the region dominates the economy of the country.\n\nThe president also assured that at the end of his eight-year tenure in May 2023, most economic and security challenges faced by the country would have been addressed.\n\nThe president made the assertions in Owerri at a town hall meeting with South-east leaders, which was the first time Imo would host a president on working visit since 2009.\n\n\u201cIt is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria. The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos are in charge of Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also said he wanted to be remembered as the president who stabilised the Nigerian security and economic situations, and delivered prosperity and triumph over corruption.\n\nThe president reiterated his commitment to credible and fair elections in 2023, and promised to complete the Second Niger Bridge as well as other on-going federal projects in the South-east geo-political zone.\n\nPresident-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor, in his remarks, assured Buhari of the continued support of Ndigbo. But Obiozor demanded that Nigerians must be governed by the principle of equity, irrespective.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cIf there is no security, there is nothing anyone can do no matter how much you try or the initiative you have. Security is number one priority and, then, the economy. When people feel secure they will mind their own business.\u201d\n\nThe president said, though, fighting corruption in the country had become very sophisticated and difficult, he would continue to strive to leave a lasting legacy of integrity and accountability in the governance.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cNobody can accuse me of having companies or mansions anywhere in the country and I thank God that I try to keep myself as clean as possible, so that I cannot be taken hostage. I will do my best to ensure that Nigerians that try hard, succeed in their efforts.\u201d\n\nHe urged leaders of the region to sincerely educate their citizens on the need to hold their elected representatives accountable.\n\nBuhari saluted and sent his admiration to the Igbo for their resourcefulness and enterprising spirit. He said, \u201cThe fundamental thing about the Igbo people is that there is no town you will visit in Nigeria without seeing the Igbos being in-charge of either infrastructure or pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe president noted that no country could make meaningful progress without the development of infrastructure. He regretted the contributions of successive governments at the federal level to the decay of critical infrastructure in the country.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that when you get infrastructure right, Nigerians will mind their own businesses,\u201d he said, adding that as a group, Igbos stand to benefit more from the on-going development of infrastructure in the country because \u201cthey are more enterprising\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks at the town hall meeting, Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State said Ndigbo believed in a united Nigeria predicated on \u201cjustice, equity and fairness.\u201d Uzodinma thanked Buhari for addressing the interests of Igbos through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the on-going construction of the Second Niger Bridge, among other projects.\n\nThe governor said the people of the region would remain grateful to the president for approving the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State, adding that as time unfolds, the economic benefits of the base would manifest.\n\nHe also commended the president for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos \u2013 Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu \u2013 into key international organisations as Director-General of the World Trade Organisation and Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organisation, respectively.\n\nObiozor assured the president of the support of Ndigbo.\n\nThe Ohaneze president-general said, \u201cNdigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria. Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean and no matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\n\n\u201cMr. President, it is in this context that we see a new dawn in your distinguished presence in Igbo land and believe that on your return to Abuja the significance and substance of this visit will form new foundation of a platform for meaningful dialogue on critical issues of concern to the Igbo nation.\u201d\n\nObiozor said the president\u2019s visit was a reassurance that there was still reason for optimism for Nigeria and Nigerian unity.\n\nHe expressed belief that the visit would mark the beginning of a new chapter of dialogue, cooperation and understanding between Ndigbo and the Buhari administration.\n\nHe stated, \u201cMr. President, after all Nigeria as gone through in its nearly 60 years of chequered history of crises and continuity and the spectacular patriotic role of Ndigbo to ensure its unity and survival, the consistent perception that the Igbos are separatists and secessionists agitators is a historical fallacy.\n\n\u201cIndeed, if the truth must be told, Ndigbo are the most federating unit among all Nigerian citizens. Generally speaking, anywhere in Nigeria you don\u2019t find the Igbos, run away something is wrong there.\n\n\u201cIgbos are market people and travel adventurers. Consequently, what defines the Igbo character is propensity for friendliness and harmonious peaceful coexistence and spirit of universalism of mankind. This is who we are. Our Igbo adage says \u2018Ojemba Enwe Iro\u2019, literally translated \u2013 a traveller makes no enemies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ohaneze leader, another misconception is that Igbos cannot speak with one voice.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. President, in spite of all the threats of secessionism or separatism facing the country, there is no doubt that no secessionist element can succeed in Nigeria provided there is good governance based on equity, justice and fairness to all the citizens.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, the most urgent and imperative need of Ndigbo today is security. The security of Ndigbo in Nigeria and beyond has become a compelling primary responsibility of serious concern for Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, our South-east zone has recently become a theatre of conflict, negating the peace-loving nature of our people. In this context Ohanaeze Ndigbo calls for the establishment of a zonal and state police apparatus to support and complement the existing federal security architecture.\u201d\n\nObiozor reiterated later on the Arise News Channel that Buhari\u2019s visit to the Igbo heartland gave the Igbo optimism for the future of Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Buhari commissioned four projects executed by the Uzodinma government, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road, and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\nAddressing Imo residents at the inauguration of Egbeada bypass, named after Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, the president said he was impressed with the level of work done by the state government.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that I will support Imo State within the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHowever, it was observed that the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over the president\u2019s visit was obeyed.\n\nIn strict compliance with the IPOB directive, residents of Owerri, the state capital, and, indeed, most of the states in the South-east complied fully with the order. Banks, offices, shops and markets were shut and the streets were deserted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Declares 20k per share interim dividend\n\nDarasimi Adebisi\n\nAfrica\u2019s leading financial institution, the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc has announced its audited half year financial results for the half year ended June 30, 2021, showing impressive growth across all major income lines and performance indicators.\n\nThe pan African financial institution delivered a 33.4 per cent appreciation in its profit before tax which rose to N76.2 billion as at June 2021, up from the N57.1 billion recorded in the same period of 2020. This translated to an annualised Return on Average Equity (RoAE) of 17.5 per cent as against 14.4 per cent a year earlier. This feat was recorded despite the challenging business and economic environment that emerged from the slow pace of activities following the global lockdown occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe results submitted to the Nigerian Exchange Limited, showed that the group\u2019s profit after tax stood at N60.6 billion, representing a significant rise by 36.3 per cent, compared with the N44.4 billion recorded in the half year of 2020.\n\nSimilarly, gross earnings grew to N316 billion, which was a five per cent increase, from the N300.6 billion recorded as at June 2020.\n\nAccording to the results, at June 30, 2021, the group\u2019s total assets crossed the N8 trillion mark as it increased to N8.3 trillion, up from N7.7 trillion at the end of the 2020 financial year. Its customer deposit also crossed the N6 trillion mark, growing by 7.4 per cent to N6.1 trillion in the period under review, compared with N5.7 trillion as at December 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the group\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Funds remained robust at N752.5 billion, up from N724.1 billion in December 2020, reflecting its strong capacity for internal capital generation.\n\nIn line with the bank\u2019s culture of paying both interim and final cash dividend, the Board of Directors of UBA declared an interim dividend of 20 kobo per share for every ordinary share of 50 kobo each, held by its shareholders.\n\nCommenting on the results, UBA\u2019s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kennedy Uzoka, expressed delight over the bank\u2019s performance in the first half of the year.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis has been a strong first half for us, as global economic recovery exceeded expectations, creating a positive rub-off on consumer and corporate confidence, savings and investment activities.\n\n\u201cWe saw this positively impact our business, as we continued to leverage our key strategic levers \u2013 People, Process and Technology, and our Customer first philosophy, to revolutionise customer experience at UBA.\u201d\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s investment in the Rest of Africa (excluding Nigeria) continues to yield good results for the group.\n\nUzoka added: \u201cThe benefits of pan-African business diversification accruing to the Group is once again evident, with gross earnings and interest income growth of 5.1 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively, despite the low yield environment in our largest market, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are making remarkable progress on our strategy that is progressively positioning UBA as the bank of choice on the continent, driven by our emphasis on tech-led innovation and best customer experience.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the GMD pointed out that the bank recognises the far-reaching effects of the pandemic on businesses globally, and remains focused on its promise to always provide our customers with the best banking experiences possible.\n\n\u201cOur first half 2021 (H1 2021) performance reflects our progressive efforts in building on the strong momentum that we started the year with. As a purpose-driven organisation, we remain resolute in our drive for sustained growth in customer acquisition, transaction volumes and balance sheet, as we consolidate our \u2018Africa\u2019s Global Bank\u2019 market position in the years ahead, uplifting livelihoods across the continent,\u201d Uzoka explained.\n\nUBA\u2019s Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO), Ugo Nwaghodoh, on his part, noted that the bank\u2019s goal was to achieve marked improvement in earnings quality whilst maintaining positive operating leverage as well as top-notch asset quality.\n\n\u201cThe Group recorded RoAE of 17.5 per cent (from 15.1% in 2020H1) and a Net-Interest-Margin of 5.8 per cent (from 5.4% in H12020) as we played the volatile yield environment diligently for best return on our interest earning assets.\n\n\u201cCapital position remained strong, with a capital adequacy and liquidity ratios of 23.9 per cent (22.4% in 2020H1) and 58.3 per cent (58.2% in 2020H1) respectively. This is robust enough to support our growth ambitions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GCFO pointed out that even while the operating environment remains largely uncertain and volatile, despite marked improvement from Covid-19 induced macroeconomic stress, UBA will continue to build resilience through its geographically diversified business model to support headline earnings growth for the Group.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our 18 per cent and 15 per cent respective RoAE and deposit growth guidance for FY 2021, as we continue to invest in growth opportunities across our geographies of operation, whilst managing capital and balance sheet prudently,\u201d Nwaghodoh stated.\n\nUBA offers banking services to more than twenty five million customers, across over 1,000 business offices and customer touch points, in 20 African countries.\n\nWith presence in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France, UBA is connecting people and businesses across Africa through retail; commercial and corporate banking; innovative cross-border payments and remittances; trade finance and ancillary banking services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Adamawa, Kogi mull value added tax laws\n\n*Port Harcourt ruling path to true federalism, says Afenifere\n\nSegun James and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nLagos State House of Assembly has passed the state\u2019s Value Added Tax (VAT) bill into law. The Assembly also passed the bill banning open grazing of cattle in the state.\n\nIf Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu signs the passed VAT bill into law, as required by the Nigerian constitution, Lagos would become the second state, after Rivers, to have a VAT law that empowers it to collect the tax.\n\nTHISDAY learnt yesterday that Adamawa and Kogi states were in the process of drafting bills to authorise them to also start collecting the consumption tax.\n\nThere is presently an on-going legal battle between the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and Rivers State on the matter. This follows FIRS\u2019s appeal of a Federal High Court judgement in favour of Rivers State in a case the state had instituted to challenge the federal revenue agency\u2019s power to collect VAT.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday threw its weight behind the VAT ruling by a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt. Afenifere called the landmark judgement a decision in the direction of true federalism.\n\nSimilarly, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Onueze C. J. Okocha, SAN, commended Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike for challenging impunity with respect to the collection of VAT.\n\nHowever, in Lagos, following the passage of the anti-open grazing bill, Miyetti Allah, the association of herdsmen in Nigeria, vowed that the price of cattle in the state would quadruple if the bill was signed into law.\n\nFollowing the passage of the VAT and open grazing ban bills, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Dr. Mudashiru Obasa, directed Acting Clerk of the Assembly, Mr. Olalekan Onafeko, to transmit clean copies of the bills to Sanwo-Olu for assent. Obasa commended his colleagues for their desire for peace and progress of the state.\n\n\u201cI thank you all for this historic exercise,\u201d Obasa said.\n\nThe Assembly held separate public hearings on the bills on Wednesday, with stakeholders overwhelmingly supporting the draft laws.\n\nThe VAT bill titled, \u201cLagos State Value Added Tax Law: A Bill for a Law to Impose and Charge Value Added Tax On Certain Goods And Services, Provide for the Administration of the Tax and for Related Matters,\u201d empowers the state to charge VAT at the rate of six per cent on the value of goods and services in the state. It also states, \u201cThe value of taxable goods and services shall be determined in the following ways: where the supply is for money consideration, its value shall be deemed to be an amount which with the addition of the tax chargeable is equal to the consideration.\u201d\n\nThe bill further states that revenue accruing from VAT would be shared on a ratio of 75 per cent to 25 per cent between the state government and the Local Government Council Areas.\n\nThe proposed law empowers the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LSIRS) to administer and implement the law and account for money collected in accordance with the law.\n\nPort Harcourt Ruling Path to True Federalism, Says Afenifere\n\nAfenifere declared support for the VAT ruling by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, advising the federal government to stop actions and policies impeding the practice of true federalism in Nigeria.\n\nThe group, in a statement issued yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, commended the Rivers State government for initiating the legal process on VAT. Ajayi said the rulings by Justice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, on August 9 and September 7 had earned the judiciary in the country an epaulet as an institution not only capable of ensuring justice but also actually working on deepening federalism.\n\nPam had while delivering judgment on August 9 in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General of Rivers State (plaintiff), against the FIRS (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant), said allowing the federal government, through the FIRS, to continue to collect VAT would be negating the spirit of the federal system of government that the country was supposed to be running.\n\nThe judge reiterated that position in the ruling of September 7.\n\nAfenifere lauded the judge, saying the manner of distribution of VAT revenue, before the judgement, was patently unfair, unjust and did not favour the hardworking while rewarding the indolent.\n\nAccording to Ajayi, \u201cFor instance, Lagos State, which generates as much as 55 per cent of this revenue, receives less than 10 per cent, while most states where less than five per cent is generated get the same amount that Lagos State gets. It is quite distasteful.\n\n\u201cThe sum collected by the FIRS is shared among the three tiers of government, with the federal government taking 15 per cent, states 50 per cent, and local governments 35 per cent.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing, it would be seen that the federal government is taking undeserved larger chunk because when 50 per cent is shared among the 36 states, what each state gets is a paltry sum. Same for 774 local government councils that share 36 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe called on the state governments to use the opportunity provided by the judgment to explore other areas that the constitution empowers them to assert themselves as federalists.\n\nAjayi said states should step up actions that would liberate the them from the stranglehold of the federal government that had turned Nigeria into a unitary state \u2013 in contradistinction to the federal spirit prescribed by the constitution.\n\nHe stated in advice to the states, \u201cThey should be rest assured of Afenifere support as they give vent to power devolution and entrenchment of true federalism in Nigeria. Areas in which the states need to assert themselves include agriculture, health, education, electricity, physical planning, title registration, registration and production of vehicle number plates, and casino licensing etc., as Lagos State Government did in the past.\n\n\u201cTo us in Afenifere, the attempt by the federal government to establish so called Farm Estates in all the 109 senatorial districts is another way of imposing the rejected cattle colony and RUGA on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is also another way of defying the federal spirit of the constitution, as lands are vested in the state governors. If the governors granted the lands being asked for, cattle colonies would be established in these estates as revealed in the view expressed by Prince Paul Ikonne, the Executive Secretary of the National Agriculture Land Development Agency (NALDA).\n\n\u201cStates should reject this attempt, particularly, since the farm estates NALDA is using as an excuse to grab lands for the federal government \u2018are familiar territory for many states, especially, in the South-west, that inherited farm estates from the defunct Regional Government of late Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\u201d\n\nOn the fear of possible multiple taxation that collection of VAT by states may occasion, Ajayi called for a roundtable discussion on the thorny aspect.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba organisation, nevertheless, called on the FIRS to resist the temptation to keep appealing the judgement that empowered states to collect local taxes, stating that such a step is another assault on the federal system that the country should be running.\n\nVAT: Okocha Lauds Rivers Govt for Challenging Impunity\n\nFormer President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Onueze C. J. Okocha, SAN, commended the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, for challenging \u2018constitutional impunity\u2019 with respect to the collection of VAT. Okocha stressed that the effort of the Rivers State ggovernment to seek and secure the right interpretation of the constitutional provision had motivated other sub-nationals to explore their rights as enshrined in the constitution.\n\nOkocha, who spoke on a television programme in Port Harcourt, reiterated that the Federal High Court\u2019s declarative ruling reaffirmed that Rivers State was empowered to collect VAT within its jurisdiction. He said the Rivers State Government VAT law, No. 4 of 2021 that was recently assented by Wike was in sync with the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nOkocha stated, \u201cRivers State Government went to court against Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and won the case. FIRS later filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal, but returned to the Federal High Court to demand a stay of execution, but the court refused the application and dismissed it.\u201d\n\nOkocha said, though the case was at the Court of Appeal and at the instance of FIRS, it could be a long winding legal battle that would get to the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe law now is that Rivers State Government is entitled to collect Value Added Tax(VAT) in Rivers State. Any other state can make its laws on Valued Added Tax, (VAT). You know that a law of another state cannot be applicable to another state. I heard that the Delta State Government is passing a similar law, too.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Insists black market is for illicit transactions\n\n*Commences multi-faceted approach to tackling dollarisation of economy\n\n*Excited about e-Naira\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will, beginning from today, raise significantly the volume of its dollar supply to authorised banks to boost foreign exchange supply in the system, reiterating that only those involved in illicit transactions patronised black market operators and paid outrageous rates.\n\nSenior central bank officials, who spoke with THISDAY, yesterday, explained that the growing illiquidity in the black market, where the US dollar traded N535 would continue as the apex bank sought to drive Nigerians to official sources, where the rate was about N411 to the dollar.\n\nThe officials insisted that the black market rate could not be a reference rate as it implemented a multi-pronged approach to stop the dollarisation of the economy for domestic transactions.\n\nThe apex bank, THISDAY learnt, had recently met with government MDAs, ministries, agencies and department to stop collecting payment in foreign currencies, targeting particularly, airlines and the Nigerian Port Authority.\n\nThe officials also made clear that those, who collect rent in dollars would be prosecuted, reiterating that if anyone needed dollars for foreign transactions, they should simply go to their banks.\n\nThe CBN officials, who expressed optimism about that measures put in place so far to check speculators, said the the apex bank has the capacity to meet all legitimate transactions channeled through the banks and maintained that the black market represented less than one per cent of foreign exchange transactions and should never be used to determine the country\u2019s dollar exchange rate.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for anyone, who needs dollars to go to the black market as long as the person needs dollars for legitimate purposes. Anyone patronising the black market to buy dollars at such rates must be engaged in illegal business, because he can get the same dollars from the banks, the CBN, investors and exporters\u2019 window at much lesser rates.\n\n\u201cSo, what is the reason they\u2019re going to the black market? Let those going to black market illegally desist from doing so. Their banks will sell them dollars through any of the approved channels. If anyone is refused, he/she should come out openly to report the bank. We will deal with the bank,\u201d the central bank officials explained in reaction to THISDAY\u2019s enquiry.\n\nThe senior officials also said the central bank had banned all government agencies from carrying out transactions in dollars.\n\n\u201cFor instance, agencies like the Nigeria Ports Authority and others that request some customers to pay dollars have been asked to stop such forthwith. Also, agencies such as the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) or airline operators involved in charters and international airlines tickets must all be done in naira, as long as they are in Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to the officials, \u201cTraders, who go to the black market will lose their capital as their replacement cost can never be matched in the black market, because their import will always be too expensive so they had better look inward and begin local production. Manufacturers too should reduce their overdependence on imported raw materials in their production as we build an economy, where most raw materials would be sourced locally.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the CBN, yesterday, reassured Nigerians that its upcoming digital currency, commonly referred to as e-Naira, would not disrupt the existing structure of the banking system but would rather enhance financial stability.\n\nThe apex bank also anticipated that the introduction of the e-Naira would improve the flow of remittances into Nigeria as it would bring about cheaper means of international fund transfer.\n\nDeputy Governor, Operations Directorate, CBN, Mr. Folashodun Adebisi Shonubi, said this at the Chartered Institute of Bankers\u2019 of Nigeria (CIBN) Advocacy Dialogue Series Four, where stakeholders converged virtually to discuss, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC): Insights for the 21st Century Banker.\u201d\n\nShonubi, who was represented by the Director, Payment Systems, CBN, Mr. Musa Jimoh,said, \u201cThis CDBC is a cheaper alternative to cash, as well as for electronic form of payment. It does have implications for both, however.\n\n\u201cThe intention is not to eliminate the use of other forms of payment, but simply to introduce a complement to the current options, areas of payments options that we have in the country and all over the world.\n\n\u201cThis will enable effective competition and the natural evolution of payment option, policies and all that, thereby ensuring the safety and stability of the payment system in the long run.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, we believe the CBDC will not disrupt the existing banking and payment landscape. No, banks and other fintechs will not be disrupted, rather, it will provide them with another platform to innovate around the new money with the opportunity to leverage the enabling infrastructure and platforms to develop value added services such as programmable smart contracts microcredits savings payments, etc.\u201d\n\nOn the impact the CBDC would have on the banking sector and the economy, he said, \u201cThis will further strengthen the banking system, especially, central banks globally, who have identified the need to ensure that banks are integral in the operation of CBDC.\n\n\u201cThe risk of disintermediation, I believe, will be assuaged even as banks take their rightful place in the dynamics of operation of CBDC. I am of the opinion that CBDC will strengthen the stability of the banking system even as the person becomes more diversified\u201d\n\nIn addition, the CBN deputy governor, said the CBDC would generally improve efficiency and promote opportunities for jurisdictions without instant payment options to benefit from faster payment system.\n\nHe also said it would bring about improved foreign exchange supply and enhance liquidity through improved international remittances.\n\n\u201cThe CBDC is expected to enhance efficiency in international remittances and address the challenge the current high cost of remittances. As remittance flow improves, the deposit base of the banks in receiving countries will also improve as one of the key benefits of the CBDC,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, however, the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Lamido Yuguda, commended the CBN over the proposed e-Naira andnoted that it would help deepen financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEarly this year, we had discussions surrounding the crypto-currency and central bank at that time said it was really going to embark on this journey to have a Nigerian digital currency.\n\n\u201cAnd today, we are actually talking about it, not only talking about it, we actually have a project that is about to be launched, kudos to our colleagues in Central Bank of Nigeria for this.\n\n\u201cWe do not think digital currency as a form of payment will affect the investment processes in the capital market, but we think that when you combine the emergence of a digital currency in Nigeria, plus the fact that we have a vibrant fintech community, I think one good thing that could come out of all this is financial inclusion,\u201d the SEC boss added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

By this act, the Bill has now become a Law,\u201d Omotoso said.\n\nThe Lagos State House of Assembly had on Thursday unanimous passed the bill.\n\nConsumers pay VAT when they purchase goods or obtain services. All goods and services (produced within or imported into the country) are taxable except those specifically exempted by the VAT Act.\n\nThe VAT rate was raised in Nigeria from five percent to 7.5 percent in 2020.\n\nVAT collection by the Federal Inland Revenue System (FIRS) on behalf of the Nigerian government has been a subject of controversy.\n\nThe FIRS, which administers the tax, transfers the generated revenue to the three levels of government via the federation accounts allocation committee (FAAC).\n\nRecently, a court in Port Harcourt restrained FIRS from the collection of VAT and empowered the Rivers state government to take charge.\n\nAfter the ruling, the Lagos state government began to domesticate a law to guide the collection of its VAT and warned FIRS to obey the Rivers ruling.\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Thursday signed into law the bill on Value-Added Tax (VAT) collection in the state.\n\nWike signed the bill which was recently passed by the state House of Assembly at the Government House, Port Harcourt.",

          "text": "Few weeks ago the Chief Imam of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Sheikh Nuru Khalid, had lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari for his failure to tackle ubiquitous banditry and galloping insecurity across the federation. In a viral video seen online the Imam swore that Allah (God) would deal with the President if he did not return Nigeria \"united and without bandits\" as he met it. The cleric while addressing worshippers during his Friday sermon said Buhari must ensure that he ended the menace before leaving power in 2023.\n\nSpeaking in his native Hausa language Sheikh Khalid asked the worshippers to go \"tell the President that there is a country we pay allegiance to, and there is a part of the country we do not know, which is governed by bandits.....the President should either return the country as one nation where bandits are not killing people anyhow \u2014 just the way he took over, or Allah (God) will deal with him\".\n\nImam Nuru made a point. Nigeria has lately become a nation governed by bandits and terrorists! Kidnapping on industrial scale is now the new money-spinning business in town! Abductors are on the rampage kidnapping for ransom. The entire country has turned crimson as professional killers, herdsmen and terrorists sow sorrow, tears and blood.\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\nEven the hitherto impregnable NDA (the Nigeria Defense Academy) in Kaduna was not spared recently as bandits ransacked there killing officers and taking others prisoners. They left with heavy ammunition stolen from the armoury! They met little or no resistance as the operation lasted. They even had the temerity to demand for ransom before releasing the abducted official in their custody.\n\nThe Chief Imam of the Apo Mosque was not alone in lamenting the failure of leadership at the centre. About the same period he spoke truth to power the founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, otherwise known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, had hurled insults on those he called 'Fulani vagabonds' said to be making life impossible for local people. The intrepid voluminous Bishop was speaking at the first service of his church ending of August at the Faith Tabernacle, Canaanland Ota, Ogun state.\n\nBishop Oyedepo described President Buhari\u2019s administration as an 'error' Nigerians made in 2015 which must not repeat itself come 2023. \"For the blood of many that they have wasted, their generations will pay for it\" the man of God declared invoking the imminent wrath of God visiting the evil men and women in the land.\n\nAnd he continued: \"If nothing happens, God has not sent me but judgment will be ravaging the land from now. Many will sleep and never wake up. Many will be struck with blindness in 24 hours. Many will be crippled in 3 days. My God is turning the table against the wicked\".\n\nThough we have not seen or heard of any of our oppressors going blind, getting crippled or slept without waking up in the morning the judgement of God is always patient. It could happen at any time or at any place.\n\nIt appears lately that majority of Nigerians are agreed that President Buhari's administration is a disaster for Nigeria. Not one waiting to happen but a disaster that has already happened. Perhaps, except Femi Adesina, Shehu Garba, Lai Mohammed and a host of other die-hard Buharists and Buharideens, the conclusion is already reached without ethnic or religious connotation or colouration that Buhari has almost destroyed Nigeria beyond recognition and redemption.\n\nFor the past six years Buhari has become a harbinger of destruction inhibiting everything that aids development of the Nigerian people. Is it in the area of security or division across ethnic or religious lines? Or power generation and distribution? Or welfare of the people and their collective pursuit of happiness? Or the value of the national currency, the Naira? Or the value of our lives, since reduced to the level of those of cows?\n\nGiven the generalised degeneration of the governance system voices of opposition are now mounting, some emanating from unfamiliar quarters up north denouncing the lethargy in governance and the poverty, lies and deception. Unfortunately, we have liars and garbages in government in Abuja professionally defending the indefensible.\n\nPresident Buhari (or the cabal doing the job for him) have positioned professional propagandists who paint black white. What cynics and critics are seeing they claim not to see. But they are meeting their match in the vociferous vibrant opposition, conventional and non-conventional.\n\nBefore our very eyes what is unfolding was unimaginable prior to the emergence of the retired General onto the national stage as President. He had campaigned for 'change' and restoration of national security and dignity. Alas, what has changed are legion: pauperisation of our people, unemployment, organized looting, corruption, insecurity and creeping tyranny.\n\nPresident Buhari has literally become an executive bull in a China shop! Care must be taken, therefore, to ease the bull out of the glass-filled shop. Before the deranged bull does further damage to the system men of goodwill, people of good conscience, patriots, elder statesmen capable of removing the beast from the anomalous position it has taken inside the building must unite their efforts to save the shop and the building.\n\nThe religious leaders across the country are united in their conclusion that Nigeria under Buharism is sick and dying! A sick country in the hands of a sick man! For Nigeria to survive and make progress then Buharism must 'die'!\n\nSOC Okenwa\n\n[email protected]",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",
          "summary": "But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years.\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\nAccording to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria.\nSeveral microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral.",

A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets. The carrier earlier this year abandoned its operation in Syria, citing regulatory demands that made operating there untenable; last month the carrier stated that it was still evaluating options in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe sale of its Afghanistan unit is crucial to MTN as it plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa. The proceeds will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nUnlike MTN, the other telecom companies operating in Afghanistan, which also includes state-owned Afghan Wireless and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates, have reassured customers and investors that services will keep running following the collapse of the US-backed government last month while trying to secure the safety of their employees in the country.\n\nMTN currently serves over six million customers in Afghanistan, its planned exit could serve as an opportunity for other Afghanistan telecom players to expand their market share, while MTN does the same in Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Nigerian stocks are underperforming when compared with peer African markets as investors worry over a slowdown in badly-needed reforms to reset a fragile economy.\n\nSince February this year, the NSE ASI has underperformed relative to the NSE20 in Nairobi, Kenya, and the All Share Index in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nIts -2.5 percent decline since the beginning of the year compares with gains of 9.9 percent in Nairobi and 12 percent in Johannesburg.\n\nAnalysts say neither the narrative for the economy nor demand factors are supportive. Although the economy grew by 5.01 percent in the second quarter of 2021, the growth was solely down to low-base effects following a 6.1 percent contraction in the same period last year. This means average incomes are still under pressure and poverty is deepening.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s slowing inflation leaves investors little to cheer\n\n\u201cPre-COVID, there were some reforming signals in Nigeria, but these have disappeared and the Federal Government is reluctant to add to the pain felt by the low-income majority,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said.\n\nSubsidy removal, whether for electricity or petrol, falls into this category of reform.\n\nDaily turnover on the NSE has averaged $8.6 million year-to-date (ytd) (at the I&E/NAFEX rate), unchanged from the same period of 2020.\n\nIt has not exceeded $10 million since the first week of May.\n\nIn Nairobi, the ytd figure is as low as $4.9 million. Growth prospects, which are a core driver for investors, are dull.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) currently sees 2.5 percent for Nigeria in 2021. This compares with 7.6 percent for Kenya and 4 percent for South Africa.\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) have become less visible players. They accounted for 21 percent of all transactions on the Lagos exchange in January-July 2021, a sharp fall on the 39 percent posted in the year-earlier period.\n\nThe pipeline of delayed external payments that developed last year is surely a factor.\n\n\u201cWe do hear anecdotal evidence that some FPIs have made at least a partial exit yet these tend to be investors in debt securities rather than equities,\u201d FBNQuest analysts said.\n\nRegulators forget sometimes that FPIs have a large choice of emerging/frontier markets from which to choose. Their favourite in Africa remains Cairo.\n\nFurther afield, they are heavily invested in markets characterised by a combination of economic reforms, entrepreneurial culture and new listings. Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh tick many of the required boxes.\n\nDomestic institutions were responsible for 46 percent of all transactions in the first seven months of this year.\n\nA sub-group of this category, the PFAs, have added to their holdings from a low base to a total of N860 billion at end-July. (As a point of reference, the market cap of the exchange is roughly N20trn.)\n\nThe 33 percent balance of transactions stem from domestic retail, for which no convincing analysis is available.",

          "text": "Nigeria may never achieve its herd immunity goal of fully vaccinating up to 70 percent of its population against the coronavirus pandemic, as access to vaccines remains stifled and hesitancy towards uptake draws the country farther from its vaccination target, health analysts say.\n\nAt best, they think Nigerians might have to live with the virus as an endemic disease such as malaria or see it fade away just how the Spanish flu of 1918 disappeared after killing an estimated 500,000 Nigerians.\n\nThe absence of a local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa\u2019s largest economy and its beggared posture of relying heavily on reluctant donors have had analysts conclude that the vaccination execution plan is very unrealistic.\n\nNigeria without doubt falls in the group of 42 African countries that the World Health Organisation (WHO) worries will miss the urgent global goal of vaccinating the most vulnerable 10 percent of their populations against COVID-19 by the end of September.\n\nJust over 9.7 million vaccine doses have been received through donations and procurement, as 1.1 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine supplied to the Federal Government on Wednesday by the African Union added to the stock available.\n\nThis leaves Nigeria\u2019s vaccination rate as one of the lowest in Africa with approximately 2.4 percent of the population covered, data from the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) show.\n\nRoughly 4 million doses have been administered when peers such as South Africa have done 15.3 million, Egypt 9.3 million, and Morocco 33.3 million.\n\nThe country needs additional 285.6 million vaccine doses to reach herd immunity level, according to BusinessDay\u2019s calculations, and must stop infections on its track to hit 200, 000 confirmed cases and rising deaths.\n\nIt seems Nigeria is sitting on a keg of gunpowder that might only take a very dangerous strain of the coronavirus to trigger a full-blown public health crisis.\n\nAnalysts dread that such an instance, if not prevented, could easily overwhelm the already fragile healthcare architecture, force a lockdown measure and push the ailing economy back on its knees.\n\nRead also: Open grazing: Lagos proposes 21 years jail term for erring herders\n\nFemi Olugbile, former commissioner for health, Lagos State, tells BusinessDay that the shortage of vaccines and the high rate of vaccine hesitancy among the population means the pandemic will linger longer than expected.\n\nHe suggests that the government can demonstrate its determination to fix the shortage by allotting more funds to increase the purchase of vaccines and push for the release of patents on vaccines to African countries with the technology to replicate the vaccines and ramp up supplies on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere would probably never be herd immunity. I think we shouldn\u2019t be wringing our hands, feeling impotent, and talking about how it would destroy our economy. I actually think we should brace ourselves and work on the low hanging fruits: reducing vaccine hesitancy and disinformation and use all the political leverage we can muster to collaborate with the South Africans and Kenyans to get a temporary waiver of the patents\u2019 rights so that we can produce locally in Africa. Nigeria also might produce under the same arrangement or any other one,\u201d Olugbile says.\n\nIf the Federal Government can take responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s situation and halt being the subject of help, the country could move closer to its goals.\n\nHow risky is the shortage?\n\nWithout adequate vaccinations, infections will continue to grow and more cost will go out of government and private coffers into managing the disease.\n\nBusinesses might be unable to keep operations running normally, although the apparent low rates of infection seen in Nigeria when compared with some countries in Europe give a bit of assurance that the country might never really face a dire situation.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head, retail investment at Chapel Hill Denham, predicts that the adoption of mandatory vaccination will increase among companies to curb infections and keep the work environment safe, but the country won\u2019t reach a lockdown decision.\n\n\u201cI think that based on the peculiarity of our situation, we don\u2019t expect to see a significant spread of the virus. And we don\u2019t expect to see implications in terms of businesses shutting down which would impact the economy. There has been a lot of caution around prevention and a lot of companies will make vaccination mandatory,\u201d he states.",

Embarking on industrial action at this time when Nigerians need you most is not the best action to take, no matter the grievances.\n\n\u201cThis Administration has a good track record of paying all debts owed to government workers, pensioners and contractors and we have even revisited debts left by past administrations, once due verification is done. Debts genuinely owed Health workers will be settled.\n\n\u201cI learnt that some of the 12-point demand in the ongoing strike was already addressed. Though the Review of a new Hazard Allowance has not been fully negotiated because of the sharp and deep division within the ranks of the striking doctors.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari said the outstanding issue of an Establishment circular issued by the Head of Service, removing House officers, NYSC Doctors from scheme of service had an addendum circular from National Salaries and Wages Commission to clarify that they will continue to earn the wages attached to them on their present wage structure.\n\nNigerian Association of Resident Doctors, had declared indefinite strike action since Monday, August 2, 2021.\n\nThe National President of NARD, Dr. Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, while announcing the strike on July 31, cited the inability of the Federal Government to implement the agreements it entered with the union 113 days after it suspended the previous strike as a reason for the industrial action.\n\nOther reasons for the strike according to the NARD boss include the poor working environment in public hospitals, irregular payment of doctors salaries and hazard allowances of N5000 which was reviewed last in 1991.\n\nHe said there was no backing down on the strike unless the Government met all the demands of the union.

          "text": "Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu has said the comprehensive approach to resolving current Nigeria\u2019s challenges is through confronting adult illiteracy and paying attention to out of school children.\n\nDisclosing this at the 2021 International Literacy Day, ILD, held in Abuja on Tuesday, Adamu said the Nigerian government is determined to confront the adult literacy programmes with the same zeal it is handling out of school children.\n\nHe said developing, sustaining and enhancing literacy skills is a lifelong and community-wide endeavour, requiring a strong commitment from the society as a whole.\n\nThe Minister said Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 calls on countries to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u2019. Specifically, SDG Target 4.6 requires that by 2030, member states should ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, it is estimated that over 6.9 million children are out of school.\n\nThis is in addition to the estimated 38% of non literate adult Population. Investing in Education of the parents will have ripple effect on the reduction of out of school Children.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that non-literate parents are more likely to breed out of school children, thereby compounding the phenomenon facing our nation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile flagging off the national activities to commemorate the 2021\n\nInternational Literacy Day, Adamu urged all stakeholders, including the journalists, to make a difference by complementing government\u2019s efforts in the fight against illiteracy in our various schedules, homes, families and immediate communities.\n\nAdamu commended Director General of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation,UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay and her staff for their continued support in coordinating wide-ranging technical and financial assistance of the UN system, donor countries and the private sector, in country-level implementation of initiatives and programmes aimed at reducing the scourge of illiteracy worldwide.\n\nAlso, speaking the UNESCO Representative, Mammadou Lamine Sow said the COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst disturbance to education and training systems in a century, with the longest school closures affecting more than 1.6 billion learners at its peak time.\n\nHe quoted the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) by November 2020, which said the average child had lost 54 percent of a year\u2019s contact time, which could be interpreted as the loss of over a year\u2019s learning if the time of forgetting what was previously acquired is counted.\n\nHe said \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the fragility of many youth and adult literacy programmes, systems and policies as represented by the abrupt suspension of numerous programmes. Consequently, we need to reflect on what action can be taken to achieve SDG 4, target 6 by \u201censuring that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy\u201d by 2030.\u201d\n\nSow said the current shift to digital teaching and learning has further widened the inequalities to the detriment of the non-formal education sub-sector.\n\nThis shift, according to him, has also highlighted the persistent digital divide in terms of connectivity, infrastructure, and the ability to engage with technology.",

This honour does not come to us as a surprise.\n\n\u201cHis highly remarkable ability to identify talents has led him to assemble what we can refer to as cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of this unprecedented, laudable initiative across the length and breadth of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the eventful birth of the National Research and Development Foundation, NRDF, will indeed be Bogoro\u2019s gift to the nation.\n\nHe said the TETFund Executive Secretary has most uniquely remained a focus on advocating for increased research funding and development and most especially, increased funding for agricultural research.\n\nThe award was received on behalf of the Executive Secretary of TETFund by Dr Mustapha Popoola, his Technical Assistant on Research and Development, while Bogoro was joined virtually to deliver his acceptance remarks.\n\nResponding, the TETFund boss thanked the leaders of the Institute for the award, stating that the induction was coming from a profession that he is proud of.\n\nHe pledged to continue to play a supportive role for the institute especially at this time that the agricultural sector is underperforming because of a number of things that have not been done right.\n\nBogoro said his advocacy for the institutionalisation of research and development in the animal science subsector was to create the opportunity to inject value addition in the agric sector.\n\nAccording to him, the absence of such value addition has been responsible for the poor performance of the agric sector.\n\n\u201cIt pains me that some years back, the agric sector in Nigeria was contributing 41% of the GDP of the nation. It went down to 35 recently. That is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cAnd the livestock subsector is the worst for it. It has continued to be the most laggard of the two subsectors and I believe that we have all a responsibility to reverse this status because in more advanced economies, in the Agric sector, the livestock subsector contributes more in terms of fiscal value,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in a keynote address, the President of African Development Bank, AfDB, Akinwunmi Adesina, represented by Emmanuel Adesina, said the AfDB recognises the livestock subsector as important in the postcovid-19 recovery effort.\n\nAdesina said that is why in 2021 and 2022, the African Development Bank plans to spend $700 million to support livestock development projects across African countries.",

As it awaits the governor\u2019s assent, more states have indicated to follow in the part.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State government has applied to be joined as a co-respondent to the suit filed by the FIRS at the appeal court.\n\nThe Attorney General of the State and Commissioner of Justice, Moyesore Onigbanjo, represented the state government at Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nHe informed the court that the interest of the state was at stake, stressing that if they were not joined, it would amount to a breach of a fair hearing.\n\nOnigbanjo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), urged the court to take the application for the joinder first before the application for the stay of execution filed by the FIRS.\n\nBut counsel to the federal agency, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), urged the court to hear the main application first, as it was of utmost priority.\n\nThe appellate court, in its ruling, held that the motion of joinder by the Lagos State government be heard and gave the applicants two days to file their written addresses.\n\nSimilarly, the respondents have been given two days to file their response, while the applicants were given a day to reply on the point of law.",

Let me speak directly to the striking doctors; embarking on industrial action at this time when Nigerians need you most is not the best action to take, no matter the grievances,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the outstanding issue of an establishment circular issued by the Head of Service, removing house officers, NYSC doctors from the scheme of service had an addendum circular from the National Salaries and Wages Commission to clarify that they would continue to earn the wages attached to them on their present wage structure.\n\nHe requested that the agreement reached in the meetings held on August 20 and 21 and captured in the MOU which he saw be religiously implemented.\n\n\u2018More Challenges Ahead\u2019\n\nTo further improve the health sector, President Buhari said budgetary allocations had been increased and a Health Sector Reform Committee led by the Vice President had been commissioned to identify and address weaknesses in the health system and align with global best practices that raise public confidence.\n\nAccording to him, the government is also supporting initiatives to expand health insurance coverage and bring more resources to health financing.\n\n\u201cWe have many more challenges ahead and much more to do, for our large population. In this respect, it is important to remind you that, as senior medical personnel and representatives of one of the most respected professional groups in the world, your responsibility for the health and wellbeing of Nigerians is clear,\u201d the President told the NMA leaders.\n\n\u201cIt does not end only with the welfare of your members but continues with a sense of responsibility for the entire country and its socio-political health and national stability. The global economy has been seriously affected by the pandemic, and despite recent pleasing news of more than five per cent economic growth of Nigeria in the last quarter, we are still having fiscal challenges to deal with, like most other countries.\n\n\u201cThe source of revenue that Nigeria has depended on for so long experienced global decline, our population is rising fast and the tension arising from both is fuelling agitation among our youth. Organisations like the NMA could play a very useful moderating role in society.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari commended the positive role of the NMA as the apex professional medical association in Nigeria, especially with regard to the ongoing industrial action.\n\nIn his remarks, NMA President, Professor Innocent Ujah, thanked the President for the appointment of members into strategic positions in government, assent to the Medical Residency Act, and immunisation coverage.\n\nHe said the association was concerned with the strike by doctors and had been doing its best to alleviate the suffering of patients across the country while appealing for an urgent resolution.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, who was also present at the meeting, said the NMA had been playing a critical role in the development of the health sector, particularly in tackling pandemics, participating in policy formulation, and population health.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has said rival forces from the war-hit Tigray region had been beaten in neighbouring Afar region and had withdrawn, but the Tigrayan forces said they had simply redeployed troops to next-door Amhara region for an offensive there.\n\n\u201cThe TPLF force has left Afar,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Dina Mufti told reporters at a news conference in the capital, Addis Ababa, referring to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for three decades but was the northern region\u2019s ruling party when fighting broke out in November 2020.\n\n\u201cAccording to a military information, they were defeated and they left,\u201d he said.\n\nTigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda, speaking to Reuters news agency by satellite phone from an undisclosed location, said the Ethiopian authorities had only now realised Tigrayan forces had withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe were not defeated. There was no fighting in Afar so we made troop movements from there to the highlands in adjoining Amhara region,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to verify either claim.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s spokeswoman told a news conference in Addis Ababa that the Tigrayan forces had been \u201crouted\u201d in the Afar region by the military and the region\u2019s militia forces, which she said had closely collaborated and inflicted heavy losses on the Tigrayan forces.\n\n\u201cThe Afar militia has been working in close collaboration with the national defence forces and the TPLF have sustained a lot of losses over the past weeks,\u201d Billene Seyoum said.\n\nGetachew disputed the claim in a series of Twitter posts.\n\n\u201c#Abiy & Co are trying to have their supporters believe that they are making advances in battlefields in #Amhara and #Afar: they are not,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthousands are being mopped down by our forces\u201d daily.\n\n\u201cThe fighting in Amhara region is proceeding in a manner that will make sure #Abiy cannot lie his way out,\u201d he said.\n\nNorthern Ethiopia has been racked by violence since last November when Abiy, the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize winner, sent troops into Tigray, saying the move was in response to attacks on army camps by the TPLF.\n\nThe TPLF, which dominated national politics until Abiy came to power in 2018, said federal forces and its allies launched a \u201ccoordinated attack\u201d against it.\n\nThe 10-month war has killed thousands of people and forced more than two million to flee their homes. There have been myriad reports of massacres and atrocities, including rape and extrajudicial killings, and hundreds of thousands of people suffering famine.\n\nIn July, after the TPLF recaptured the regional capital of Mekelle and seized back most of Tigray, its forces advanced into Afar and Amhara regions, marking an expansion of the conflict into previously untouched areas.\n\nSince then, the government estimates that about 450,000 people have fled fighting in those two regions.\n\nAbiy rejected early appeals from high-level AU envoys for talks with Tigrayan leaders, sticking to his line that the conflict is a limited \u201claw and order\u201d operation.\n\nOn Thursday, Billene said Ethiopia was considering offers by neighbouring countries to help facilitate a solution to the conflict.\n\n\u201cThese efforts are seen positively by the Ethiopian government and as an extension of goodwill, and they are being reviewed.\u201d",
