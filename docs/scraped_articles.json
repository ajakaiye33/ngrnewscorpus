          "title": "How I endured hardship in London before getting breakthrough in business \u2013 Kevin Olu",
          "text": "Hon. Kevin Olu\n\nDelta State entrepreneur and politician, Hon. Kevin Olu, has revealed how he endured hardship abroad before getting his first major breakthrough in business and life.\n\nAccording to Kevin Olu, who comes from the Fregene\u2019s family in Fregene quarter at Ogwanja in Koko Warri North Local Government Area, he does fall into the category of Nigerians who went abroad to do jobs that bring shame and dishonour to themselves, families and indeed the country.\n\nREAD ALSOTwo years in office: We\u2019ve secured over 400 jobs for Ebonyi people in Federal parastatals \u2014 Ebonyi Reps member\n\nSpeaking with journalists during a recent interview, Hon Kevin Olu, the CEO of two reputable companies, Orit-winors Nig Ltd and First Triple Billionaire said: \u201cTo rise from the obscurity of life to the stardom is not so easy, but it is possible to attain success from nowhere if only the person could be serious and be hardworking.\n\nRecounting how he first travelled abroad, Hon Kevin Olu said, \u201d in 2000, after i finished my diploma, i got a visa to Greece, from there i traveller to Italy, where i spent three months, trying to look fot greener pastures. From there, i went to Amsterdam and from there, i travelled to London..\n\n\u201cWhen i got to London, that was where I got a small job. There they called that job peke. I started working in the toilet, arranging perfume, telling people to freshen up for the ladies, inside the toilet. Then, there was a lot of money in that job. They will be dashing you coins, throwing coins at you as a beggar. When you finished working that day, you will now go to your boss, and give him all the money. And after a week, they will now send you salary down to you..\n\n\u201d I did that job fot about seven months in London. After that, i now.met a Pakistani, who taught me more about business. He asked me what I was doing, i told him. I also told him i had a diploma in business management. He asked me to start working with him and as i started working with him, that was how all my breakthrough came. He taught me how to do proper business .\n\n\u201cFrom there, I went into Western Union.I established a Western Union shop. It was my own shop. I also had Money Gram. I make bold to say that was where i got my major breakthrough, by having a lot of physical cash. That was how i came back into Nigeria. I went into politics snd started running my own business\u201d, added Hon Kevin Olu.\n\nHe recalled how he also.slept inside a London bus for survival. In the exact words of Kevin Olu, \u201d when I was doing that job called peke, i remember, I always went from Willis because my brother used to stay in Willis but after sometime, there was no way, no house to stay. So i started sleeping on Bus 51 because Bus 51 straight from Willis, went straight to West End and West End is like tje centre of.London where you can get all kinds of jobs, where you can do all kinds of work. I slept in that bus for over two months because the bus is a twenty four hours job.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy staying on the bus as the drivers will at times, after getting to the last bus stop around 4am, stop the vehicle and go round to shout that, \u2018 hello, hello, hello, this is your last stop\u2019. It will.force me to get down from the bus and quickly brush your mouth somewhere and quickly jump into another bus or if no bus was available, you will go to a friend\u2019s place and start gisting until the time of work starts around seven\u201d, added Hon Kevin Olu.\n\n\u201cThis is my story. I thank God today that I could get to where I am now because I made my way abroad to make it in life. I worked and struggled my way to the success I attained today,\u201d said Hon Kevin Olu, who holds a Diploma in Business Administration and Bsc. in Public Administration from Edo State University Ekpoma, Edo State.",

We can work together as we have done in this long-haul response to COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NCDC boss urged people to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if they had not, noting that it was safe, effective and would reduce the occurrences of severe diseases and deaths.\n\nHe said that the National Primary Health Care Development Agency has continued to lead on the rollout of vaccines.\n\n\u201dJust last week, we had the national flag-off of the mass vaccination campaign and are ensuring they are safe and effective vaccines.\n\n\u201cThere are now strategic vaccination sites around the FCT,\u201d he added.\n\nThe director-general further said that the national COVID-19 emergency operations centre continued to meet weekly to coordinate on the response to the ongoing pandemic.\n\n\u201cWith regards to genomic surveillance, we have continued to consider the critical need to address the importation of variants and our sequencing efforts are still underway,\u201d he said.\n\nAdetifa also said that laboratories were still available for COVID-19 testing, while urging Nigerians to get tested if they feel COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n\u201cDo not assume symptoms may be malaria or a typical cold. We are working to strengthen COVID-19 risk communications using innovative and targeted means by listening to the public and responding effectively.\n\n\u201cThe team is currently collaborating on the development of a COVID-19 response sustainability plan and an intra action review to strategise on ways to reinvigorate the response,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Fatima Yusuf, Deputy Director, Federal Ministry of Health said that the Port Health, Public Health Services, (PHS) had continued to heighten surveillance at lands, airports and seaports.\n\n\u201cPHS screens all passengers coming into the country at the various points of entry and so far, it has screened 87,841 people in September, 74,660 in October and 8,701 in November.\n\n\u201cPHS also provides traffic data on inbound passengers from all over the world and it has continued rapid diagnostic testing at the Seme and Idiroko borders.\n\n\u201d15 positive cases were detected out of 1,679 screened with 0.9 per cent positivity rate,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe deputy director said that the positive cases recorded at the ground crossings have dropped significantly and none had been detected in the past two months.\n\nShe noted that PHS officers were still positioned at the seaports where passengers and crew of ships were screened before berthing.\n\n\u201dSo far, 138 COVID-19 positive cases have been detected in the country\u2019s seaports and offshore platforms.\n\n\u201cThe positive cases detected among oil rig workers has also dropped significantly.

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, lHURIWA, has said it is shocked that up till now, the Armed Forces have deliberately refused to crush terrorists, who are being tagged \u2018bandits\u2019 in the North West region of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe regret to observe that these terrorists who are mostly ethnic Fulani same ethnicity with all the heads of the internal security institutions are still operating freely in Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara and Katsina and have killed scores of citizens only in the last few days,\u201d HURIWA said in a statement signed by its coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and made available to DAILY POST on Monday.\n\nThe group wondered why the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, has failed to carry out his primary responsibility of protection of lives and properties of citizens.\n\nFurthermore, HURIWA cited the Global Terrorism Index (2019) which ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017.\n\nThe group noted that asides insurgency (such as Boko Haram and Islamic State in Western African Province, ISWAP), banditry, kidnapping and secessionist violence are pushing Nigeria towards the brink of collapse.\n\nThe group underlined the fact that many citizens are calling for the resignation of Buhari for \u201cfailing\u201d to secure the country.\n\n\u201cFor the past six years, the insecurity across Nigeria has worsened beyond the Boko Haram insurgency. Virtually all parts of Nigeria are currently battling one form or another of violent crimes, evidence that the president has failed to keep his promise on security.\u201d\n\nAccording to HURIWA, many of the populace no longer believe the President, while many others rather feel the opposite about his positive self-assessment.\n\nThe analysis showed that insecurity affects economic growth by drying-out investments, increases unemployment and dwindles government revenue, amongst others. Despite these effects, government capital expenditure on internal security did not grow astronomically to match the hydra-headed problem.\n\nA prominent Islamic scholar, Sheik Murtala Sokoto, described those still praising Buhari as liars and hypocrites.\n\nEven within President Buhari\u2019s own party, many people who worked for his victory now complain openly that the mission that brought them to power might have been willfully abandoned.\n\nDAILY POST can report that terrorists, who are referred to as bandits, have continued to operate freely in the North West Nigeria despite the shutting down of telecommunications In some areas in the region by the Federal Government.\n\nJust yesterday, there were cases of abduction of commuters travelling the Abuja-Kaduna highway by gunmen suspected to be bandits.",

Details and other arrangements will be announced shortly,\u201d she said.\n\nBaba Suwe became popular for his comic roles in several Nollywood films and television productions between late \u201880s and mid-\u201890s.\n\nThe actor and film producer became famous for his TV series, Erin Keeke, which had Yoruba as the language of communication.\n\nThe series made waves on NTA Channel 7 in the \u201890s and featured popular film stars, like Opebe, Madam Saaje, Suwe, Emukay, and others, until it stopped airing in 1996.\n\nThe veteran actor went on to make an impact on the home video scene by appearing in several movies and later producing over 10 under his Erin Keeke imprint and late Babs Omidina Production.\n\nHis fame continued to grow after he featured in Olaiya Igwe\u2019s movie, titled: Iru Esin, in 1997.\n\nHe also worked with various major movie producers and marketers, like Bayowa Films and Corporate Pictures.\n\nSome of his memorable works include Baba Laarinlodu, Baba Jaiye Jaiye, Ojabo Ko Fo, and Elebolo.\n\nHe fell ill in 2018 and his health deteriorated until 2019 when several Nigerians, including Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, donated funds for his medical treatment abroad.\n\nPresident of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), Emeka Rollas, yesterday mourned Baba Suwe.\n\nIn a short statement sent to The Nation, Rollas wrote: \u201cWe received the news of his demise with shock. But we are consoled that he lived a worthy life and left his footprint on the entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cHis contribution to Nollywood cannot be quantified. He will forever be remembered for his professionalism and his art which many have excelled in and many more are following his footsteps doing well.

If you fall terribly sick or run into any problem, that you need moral support, that is when you will know you amount to nothing to them.\n\n\u201cEfele, you cease to exist. That energy for your party gone; they won\u2019t look for you. Definition of our love is different from what we portray in our movies. Fake lives always win on social media, no matter how honest you are. We can restore true love if we stop.\u201d\n\nBorn on August 22, 1958 and raised in Inabere Street on Lagos Island, Baba Suwe is an indigene of Ikorodu area of Lagos.\n\nHe began acting in 1971 but came into the limelight after he featured in a movie titled: \u2018Omolasan,\u2019 a film produced by Obalende.\n\nHe henceforth rose to prominence in Yoruba comedy films.",

We are, therefore, asking all school principals to collect N18,000 per candidate for registration.

It is the doing, the efforts of the various ministries of education, schools and candidates. They may have used our chief examiner\u2019s report to improve preparation for the examination.\n\n\u201cLet us not be doubting Thomases and incurable pessimists. Our results are verifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nFor candidates in the Southeast whose examinations were disrupted by the sit-at-home order of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Areghan said they were registered free of charge for the WASSCE for private candidates to take the papers they missed.\n\nHe added that the result was being released 45 days after the seven-week examination ended on October 8, despite serious challenges the council faced in conducting and grading the examination.\n\n\u201cThe examination ended October 8, 2021 and \u202645 days after the conduct of the last paper, we are releasing the result! This is a record time, taking into consideration the fact that we lost a week to insecurity, during the marking exercise in the Southeast, occasioned by the heightened tension before and during the Anambra governorship election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HNO also said the timetable for the 2022 examination would return to the normal May-June belt.\n\nHe added that the National Identity Number (NIN) would be a prerequisite for registration, urging candidates to ensure they enrol before then.\n\n\u201cAnother component of the registration requirements will be the National Identification Numbers (NINs) of candidates. Schools will be expected to supply the NIN of every candidate as part of the registration requirements. This is in line with the directive of the Minister of Education.\n\n\u201cWe advise all schools to comply accordingly.

          "text": "From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt\n\nProperty worth billions of naira have been lost, as fire outbreaks occurred at three different locations in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in less than 72 hours.\n\nAt the weekend, residential houses in Isiokpo Street, D/Line, in Port Harcourt City Local Government Area and Zenith Bank Plc, located in Rumuokoro, Obio/Akpor LGA, were razed by fire.\n\nOn Monday, the third fire incident occurred at the Bonny/Bille Jetty and burnt several boats and destroyed goods and property.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the three fire incidents were caused by the unadulterated fuel and kerosene popularly called \u201ckpo-fire\u201d.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed number of casualty was reported in the Bonny/Bille incident. Some eye witness say about 10 persons had lost their lives to the fire prompting a violent reaction by the mob on sighting the Fire Service.\n\nThe Federal Fire Service said its officials escaped mob action at the Bonny/Bille jetty, when they responded to contain the escalation. Commander of the Federal Fire Service in Rivers State, Abdullahi Audu Alfa, disclosed this to journalists. He condemned the act, saying efforts must be made to sensitize residents on how to respond to emergencies. Meanwhile, the fire outbreak at the Bonny/Bille jetty is yet to be put out at the time of filing the report, several hours after it started from a market boat with passengers onboard. Eyewitnesses disclosed that the boat carried food items and illegally refined petroleum products.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers State Commissioner for Special Duties, Emeka Onowu, who spoke at the D/Line, where the first fire incident occurred, has expressed concerns about the incidents and frowned at the activities of illegal oil dealers.\n\nOnowu urged Rivers residents to assist the state government with relevant information to checkmate the activities of illegal oil dealers, saying that government could do everything for the citizenry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem we are having is that, I think the citizens do not having confidence in security agencies again. If not, most of them are scared that if they lay complains of such nature, tomorrow, somebody would sabotage them and reveal the source to them (dealers). They are scared to speak out.\n\n\u201cLook at this environment, look at the people living in this environment. You won\u2019t tell me that people living in this environment do not know that something of this nature was going on here.\n\n\u201cPlease, I want to plead with Rivers State people, government cannot do everything for you. It is not possible. No government can do that. Help us in you own little way. Give us information. The Ministry of Special Duties is there; the Ministry of Energy is there. Even if you don\u2019t want people to know, write quietly and send to us.\n\n\u201cLet me make this clear to the public, so that you will know; no state government regulates the production of petroleum. Nobody. It is only exclusive list of the president.\n\n\u201cIf somebody can conceive this idea and can do something like this and refined, why can\u2019t Federal Government encourage these boys than importing fuel. Nobody justifies the activities of these boys. Look at what they have caused, destroying property worth billions of naira. And you are putting government in tight corner.\n\n\u201cWe are not the one that kept the fuel in your compound. We (government) are not the one that kept illegal bunkering in your community. If you had raised the alarm to us, we have taken the decision before this time.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the Ministry was setting up a committee to investigate the causes of the fire incident, noting that the fire outbreaks in Rumuokoro and D/Line were similar.\n\n\u201cWe (government) want to know where this product is coming from. If we can find out where this particular product is coming from, then, we can pick up from there. So, we are going to set up a committee and work in synergy with the Ministry of Ernegy. Again, I beg the masses, do not be scared to speak.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Isaac Anumihe and Joseph Inokotong, Abuja\n\nParents and school proprietors in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, are in a panic mode, over rising wave of abductions and attacks by bandits, especially around the southern and northeastern fringes of the FCT.\n\nThe parents cited the recent attack on the staff quarters of the University of Abuja in Giri, Gwagwalada Area Council by gunmen and the abduction of a vice principal around Kwali Area Council.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nDaily Sun gathered from some school proprietors that daily bus shuttle services have been suspended till further notice, pending when security would improve.\n\nA school proprietor told our correspondent they were advised by top security agents that bandits were plotting to launch coordinated attacks and possibly ambush school buses conveying school children.\n\nThe proprietor said her colleagues were making plans to halt the services in the new year when students resume from the Christmas break.\n\nShe further revealed the presence of large private and government security agents around many schools in Abuja, as part of moves to prevent any possible attack by bandits who are believed to be operating already around many parts of Abuja.\n\nShe said schools under the control of the FCT Administration, would shutdown long ahead of the Christmas break, to allow government work out a policy that would be made known by January.\n\nSome of the parents said the FCT Administration, headed by Muhammad Bello, appeared overwhelmed by the many challenges facing the territory.\n\nDr. Kehinde Akinbode, proprietor of Kareem International School, Kuje, while reacting to the alert that bandits and terrorists were beginning to target schools in the FCT, confirmed that parents were apprehensive, but said he has assured them that adequate measures were already in place to forestall any unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\u201cI will not disclose to you what we have done because it is top secret and a security issue. Be rest assured that our school is safe. We have done everything humanly possible to prevent any security breach here,\u201d said Dr. Akinbode.\n\nAt the New Hope International School, Kuje, a female administrative manager, who said she had no permission to speak on the issue, disclosed that the school management has been holding series of meeting with stakeholders since the University of Abuja kidnap saga.\n\nShe disclosed that work on the perimeter fencing of the school which was suspended due to lack of funds has commenced and would soon be completed. Besides, she pointed out that the location of the school would make it difficult, if not impossible, for any intruder to gain access to the premises, noting that closure of the school due to insecurity is not being considered. She admitted as genuine, fears being harboured in some quarters that bandits and terrorists are beginning to target schools in the FCT.\n\nMajor private schools on the fringes of Nasarawa, such as Mararaba and Nyanya, are apprehensive and have beefed up security. Investigations by Daily Sun revealed that parents have started withdrawing their children and wards from boarding houses, while day students have stopped using school buses.\n\nMany parents, according to investigations, now take their children to school in their own vehicles or engage the services of drivers who take their children or wards to and from schools.\n\n\u201cNasarawa State is a neighbouring state and what happens there can spill over to FCT. So, it is better to be on the side of caution,\u201d Mrs Peace Ntaji, whose children attend one of the prestigious schools in Nyanya, revealed.\n\nShe said dormitories are soft targets for bandits and that it makes no sense for her children to remain there.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s Grace, I have a car that has not been put to use for some time. I will fix it for the children,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother parent, Mr. Williams Agiriga, told Daily Sun that he has withdrawn his wards from the school bus because, according to him, apart from the boarding houses, the school buses are also soft targets.\n\n\u201cWe will devise a way of taking them to school and bringing them back. We are in perilous times. One has to be extra careful with what one does. Exposing the children to unnecessary danger is not the best,\u201d he noted.\n\nFor the second time, this year, Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, has raised the alarm over activities of a group known as Darusalam, a dreaded version of Boko Haram in the state. Eight months after raising the alarm, there have been increased cases of kidnappings and disappearances of persons.\n\nHowever, the FCT Administration has revealed that it would continue to pay adequate attention to school security.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

Nigeria is in a state of disarray. But a good political party and a good government can solve this problem of insecurity.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that traveling by road is now dangerous, traveling by train is also dangerous. And those who have the money travel by air. But the common man cannot travel by air. Anywhere you go today, you are not safe.\n\n\u201cThe industrial development in Nigeria is not going well because government policy is not consistent over the years.\n\n\u201cIf government policy is consistent, Nigeria wouldn\u2019t have been where it is. Every policy needs to be consistent for a period of five years running. But changing policy soon after implementation by successive government is not good for industrial development of the country.

          "title": "2023: Osinbajo Dares Tinubu as Support Group Opens Campaign Office in Abuja",
          "text": "*Tinubu movement keeps mum\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA political slugfest seems to be in the offing between Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as an Osinbajo support group made public and formal their principal\u2019s intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 with the launch of a campaign office at the weekend in Abuja.\n\nCuriously, after months of equivocation and outright repudiation, Osinbajo appears finally ready to emerge from the shadows of doubt and throw his hat in the ring for the country\u2019s top job.\n\nA major pointer to this suggestion is the opening of a campaign office by a motley coalition of his supporters.\n\nThough some of the vice president\u2019s supporters denied the office launched was Osinbajo\u2019s campaign office, they said it was merely the office of a coalition aiming to draft him into the 2023 presidential race.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, also denied the opening of a campaign office by his principal, in a chat with a national daily (not THISDAY), describing the report as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nThe campaign office, located at No. 15b, Buchanan Crescent, off Aminu Kano, by Emab Plaza, Wuse 11, Abuja, was inaugurated on Saturday in Abuja. It was decorated with Osinbajo\u2019s banner, bearing the inscription, \u201cFace of Hope.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary of the group, Mr. Emmanuel Pippa, in a statement yesterday, reiterated that the office belonged to the support group.\n\nPippa said in the statement, \u201cOur attention has just been brought to online publications, which allege that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has opened a campaign office in Abuja ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the said office belongs to our coalition of support groups, which strongly believes in Professor Osinbajo as the leader Nigeria needs in 2023, and is determined to get him to declare an interest in running for the office of President as early as possible.\u201d\n\nThe group said to actualise the objective of bringing the vice president into the presidential contest, they recently acquired an administrative office in the heart of Wuse 2 area of Abuja.\n\nThey added that though Osinbajo was yet to be acquainted with their activities, they intended to operate through a new organ, The Progressive Project (TPP), to coordinate the youth, women, and other groups across the federation.\n\nThe group declared: \u201cOurs is, therefore, not a campaign office but a venue for coordination, handling of increasing volume of correspondence, and meetings in readiness for the time, when Vice President Yemi Osinbajo accedes to our request for him to run and consolidate gains made under President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe group stressed that party chieftains would lead the real campaign in the fullness of time. It also stated that being a heartbeat away from the number one job, there were countless members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and even non-partisan citizens across the federation, who were pushing for Osinbajo to succeed Buhari in the interest of the country.\n\nThe group said it was convinced that Osinbajo\u2019s level of familiarity with the vision, achievements and challenges being handled by Buhari was second to none and that such insight would enable a new APC administration hit the ground running in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tinubu Support Group refused to give an opinion on the development. Acting Director, Media and Publicity of the group, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, when contacted for his reaction, declined comment on the latest development coming from the Osibanjo camp.\n\nThough the vice president has not officially announced his intention to contest the 2023 presidency against his political godfather and former governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, the opening of the campaign office at the weekend in Abuja was a strong indication that he might have decided to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2015 elections, recall that Tinubu wanted to be Buhari\u2019s running mate and had done everything possible to get the ticket, including stalling the nomination process, after he was initially appointed by the party leadership to head a selection committee.\n\nBut Tinubu\u2019s ambition of becoming Buhari\u2019s deputy hit brick wall because the mood of the nation at the time was believed to be averse to a Muslim/Muslim ticket, a situation that eventually paved the way for the nomination of Osinbajo by Tinubu, in the presence of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E.A Adeboye.\n\nIt is, therefore, believed that for yielding the position of the number two citizen to him in 2015, despite wanting it for himself, it is only morally and politically imperative that Osinbajo would seek and secure Tinubu\u2019s blessing if he truly intends to run in 2023. But some Tinubu supporters believe he should not even seek the office of President since he knows Tinubu is nursing similar ambition.\n\nUnfortunately, those who believe Osinbajo should seek Tinubu\u2019s endorsement have another thing coming, because Tinubu is not about to make that sacrifice a second time. Since he too now wants the big prize for himself and has not relented in his push for the presidency in 2023, even though largely by support groups.\n\nHowever, prior to the inauguration of the campaign office, the Osinbajo group had in July lobbied some highly-placed members of APC to join forces towards mobilising support for Osinbajo.\n\nThe group, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, titled, \u201cAPC and The Future of Nigeria: Why We Must Get It Right and Consider the Osinbajo Option in 2023,\u201d and jointly signed by its National Coordinator, Mr. Ahmed Mohammed, and National Secretary, Dr. Eberechukwu Dibia, said there was need for early preparations towards ensuring that Osinbajo and some elements within the current administration emerged to deepen APC and Buhari\u2019s legacies after 2023.\n\nThe letter, which was addressed to the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, and other top party leaders, indicated that several APC governors, principal officers in the Senate, and House of Representatives, members of the APC National Caretaker Committee, former and serving federal legislators, other stakeholders, as well as the political aides of Osinbajo were being lobbied to partake in the mobilisation process.\n\nIt said, \u201cWith history in mind, we, members of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), hereby solemnly join our voices with that of many others in appealing that you throw your weight behind our call for consideration of an Osinbajo successor administration after that of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), would have run a full course in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2013 without any iota of doubt \u2013 that giving a worthy element within the system such as Vice President Osinbajo the chance to lead would not only enrich the system; it would certainly be the best assurance of stability and progress for extant developmental objectives.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed conviction that the task of inspiring party members \u201ctowards a shared consciousness of insightful search for Buhari\u2019s successor come 2023 should not be left to chance or last minute \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 contests,\u201d stressing that Osinbajo should be collectively adopted as the right successor.\n\nThe group took it a step further, when it inaugurated the campaign office. Though the support group has denied Osinbajo has a hand in it, analysts wonder where the group is getting the funding to bankroll its activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Well, we are actually working on two plans \u2013 we are also working on the Nigeria Agenda 2050, which is a longer term plan for the country. What we have as objectives of the NDP are to ensure that the diversification of the economy is concentrated, more inclusive and sustainable. I hear people say we have not achieved diversification, but that is not true. The Nigerian economy is truly diversified. People say we are dependent on the oil and gas sector, but how much is the oil and gas sector\u2019s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)? It is probably about eight per cent. The whole of the 92 per cent is the non-oil sector. So the economy is truly diversified. But we would need to deepen that diversification; we need to support micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) to grow, so that our GDP growth would be more sustainable.\n\nAnother major objective of the plan is to create jobs, reduce poverty and also deepen the development of the agriculture sector and enhance food security. How are we going to do this? It is by concentrating more on developing agri-business. Our agriculture over the years had been largely subsistence until 2015, when the president took over power and decided to select some parts of the agriculture value chain to concentrate on. In the ERGP, we selected three crops that we said we were going to achieve self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency is very important, because a population of 200 million people should be able to feed itself.\n\nWhen we were doing the plan, we asked Mr. President for his guidance and he just said, we must grow what we eat and consume what we produce. And every time we sat down, what we needed to do to achieve that just kept expanding.\n\nOf course, agriculture and food security are obviously key priorities for Nigeria\u2019s government today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and whichever government comes must concentrate on agriculture and food security and then the improvement of the welfare of its citizens, which is the third key objective of the new NDP. These are basic things that any government that comes into power must do. We set out this plan in a manner that produced a fully developed NDP. We were accused that the ERGP was a federal government plan and so we wanted to change that. We did this by putting together a very broad spectrum of multiple stakeholders; so it involves the federal, state and local governments. The steering committee is chaired by myself and Atedo Peterside from the private sector and there is a strong private sector representation in the steering committee, the central working groups and the 26 technical working groups that we have.\n\nIn each of the technical working groups, we have representatives of six states, we have the local government representative, youth representative, women, people with special needs and different spheres of businesses. And this plan was built by both top-down and bottom-up approach. The concentrations were wide and what we want is for every Nigerian to actually own this plan. There are some countries, if you enter a taxi and start talking about the country, they would tell you the priorities of that country. That is what we want. We want every Nigerian to feel that they have a responsibility to contribute towards the development of this country. What is different about this plan compared to other plans? We took the pain to cost the plan and even though you have said the N348 trillion is large, we made the costing to be very pessimistic.\n\nFor example, when we were costing the revenue for oil and gas, we used $40 per barrel across the five years and the reason being that crude oil pricing is not something that you have control over. It is completely out of our control and it has this impact on the government, because even though our economy is diversified, crude oil is still the largest earner of forex. There is a strong focus on the plan to diversify the economy to support exports so that we can also have alternative sources of forex from oil and gas. Of course, the most likely sectors are agriculture and solid minerals, which involves the mining sector. We see a great potential in the mining sector and also greater potential in the agriculture value chain. When we were doing the plan, one of the issues we found out was human capital.\n\nIn every sector of the economy, there is the consideration of the kind of skill set you need to develop in the various sectors to be able to realise the objectives that we set. So capacity and skills are cross-cutting issues. Other cross-cutting issues for us are innovation and technology. That is because for us to make a quantum leap, and increase production, whether in the oil and gas sector, agriculture, mining, education or health, you have to use ICT. Then, based on the directive of the president, there is a serious attention on education and health. Why? That is because Nigeria still has one of the poorest human capital development indexes and we need to continuously look at how to improve the health and education sectors. We took the pain together with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies and the states to cost the plan, which is something that has never been done before.\n\nSo the N348 trillion was actually a line by line costing of programmes and projects in each of the five years that we put together. The plan is in three volumes. There is the policy itself, which is the plan; there is the costing and there is a third volume, which contains reforms that must be undertaken as well as legislations that may either be amended or made, to make sure we are able to achieve the targets. We also had representatives from the three major political parties as part of the process, because we wanted the plan to be beyond the ruling party. We had the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The truth is that the PDP didn\u2019t show up for one day, but we made sure we invited them to every meeting.\n\nBut for this plan to really be effective, is there a plan to sensitise members of the public and how are you going about that?\n\nThere is a communication plan that is just like an outline, but needs to be developed. Why it has not been developed in full is that we realised that we need more consultations on that aspect of the plan itself. The communication plan would be able to educate everyone on specific responsibilities. That is, everyone would know the responsibilities of government in the plan, that of the states, businesses and citizens. Citizens have the responsibility to pay taxes, to hold the government accountable and to obey the laws. So there is a communication plan that would identify every stakeholder and their responsibilities in the value chain and also the method that would be used in communicating the plan to the various groups and stakeholders.\n\nYou said the economy is diversified, but why is Nigeria still heavily dependent on oil revenue to the extent that once there is a shock in the oil sector, the impact on our economy is always immediate?\n\nThe economy is fully diversified, but we need to deepen that diversification; we also need to enhance our alternative exports to oil and gas. Right now, the oil and gas sector still earns like 90 per cent of the forex for our economy and that exposes us to different kinds of fragilities and any hiccup in the sector affects. Forex has effects on so many things, including production, because of inputs that need to be brought into the country by the manufacturers.\n\nAre there milestones that have been set in this new NDP to measure achievements and successes in different sectors?\n\nThere is a robust monitoring and evaluation framework that has been set. There is a national steering committee that would be headed by the Vice President, with some ministers. The secretariat would be the planning arm of the ministry. The costing also included clear key performance indicators that needed to be tracked and measured on an ongoing basis. There is a Project Implementation Unit, that has been set up, whose sole responsibility is the tracking of performance of the plan on a daily basis. The unit will be tracking not just the federal government component, but also the states and private sector performances.\n\nFederal government\u2019s revenue projections have always missed targets. For 2022, 34.9 per cent of projected revenue is to come from oil-related sources while 65.1 per cent is expected from non-oil sources. Is there any reason for optimism that the country might have a break from the past?\n\nThe 2021 budget has 55 per cent revenue contribution from the non-oil sector and 45 per cent from the oil sector. From 2019, we were able to turn the tide such that the greater contribution to our revenue is from the non-oil sector. The actual performance of the non-oil sector as at the end of August 2021 was 116 per cent. So it is not true that we have never reached the target; we have actually gone above the target in terms of non-oil revenue. It is the oil and gas sector that is actually lagging behind and when we prorated the total performance as of August, it was 73 per cent. So revenues have picked up generally, because in 2019, we put in place the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative (SRGI), which is an initiative of our ministry that was designed to enhance the existing revenue streams, to also identify and put in place new revenue streams. Since then, we have seen our revenue increase on an incremental basis, but the problem is that our expenditure has also been increasing and much faster than the revenue.\n\nIn 2020, when we had the COVID-19, we ended up going out to borrow more money. We were on a growth part for about 12 quarters and our revenues were increasing reasonably. When this administration came into power, the Revenue-to-GDP was six per cent, but we were at nine per cent at the end of 2019, but now we are down to eight per cent. But our target is to get to 15 per cent by 2025. So the SRGI has helped us to not only increase revenue, but to enforce necessary reforms that have helped us to reduce leakages, cut down costs that are necessary, introduce the Finance Bill that we have so far done in 2019 and 2020. The Finance Bill was part of the initiatives that we have in the SRGI and through the instruments of the Finance Bill, we have been able to do so many things in terms of improving the fiscal space across several sectors of the Nigerian economy by changing and amending laws. Every year, we continue to tighten those gaps that were resulting in wastage within the economy.\n\nOne issue that keeps coming up is Nigeria\u2019s debt. The Senate recently approved fresh borrowing for the federal government, are you not worried about the country\u2019s rising debt profile which the Chairman of the President\u2019s Economic Advisory Council recently warned was unsustainable?\n\nOn revenues, we can look inwards and we are looking inwards and also a lot of the things we are doing in terms of enhancing revenue are working. Every Nigerian is right to be concerned about borrowing. Even as a household, if you are borrowing continuously, you should be worried about it, because the thing about borrowing is that you need to repay. So while we have been borrowing, we have made sure that we apply what we borrow to critical infrastructure necessary to enhance our business environment. If we don\u2019t invest to make sure that we have adequate power, good roads and also that we have rail lines that are able to move cargoes, not just people and that our airports are of international standards, it would cost us in terms of growth and we would be regressing. It is not fun for us just going out to borrow. We are also not borrowing irresponsibly. We have a Debt Management Office and there is a lot of rigour that goes through the borrowing process.\n\nFirst of all, there is a limit to borrowing that was set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The limit today is three per cent of the GDP. In 2020, we exceeded three per cent, because of the national emergency. In 2021, we also exceeded it slightly, but in 2022, we have been able to come down to 3.05 per cent and in subsequent years, we are reducing. I say it again today, that we don\u2019t have a debt problem, what we have is a revenue problem. At about 23 per cent of GDP, Nigeria\u2019s debt level is one of the lowest amongst its comparators. It is the revenue that we have to concentrate on, working on and also we have to be vigilant as Nigerians to make sure that the borrowing is applied to important projects that would enhance the growth of the economy. And for our revenues, we have taken a lot of measures. The Finance Act has helped us to tighten a lot of the gaps that used to exist, especially the provision we made in the Act that limits government-owned enterprises to 50 per cent expenditure of their revenue. In the past, we had agencies that would spend 95 per cent of their revenues and either very little or nothing came to the government.\n\nAre they complying?\n\nYes, it is working even though it is very difficult to enforce. People are not happy about it, but it is a law and we are enforcing it. In the 2021 budget, we have been able to bring all government enterprises into the budget and now, we have 64 agencies and that gives us control, to be able to see even from the budget level that the expenditure budgets of those agencies are limited to that 50 per cent. It is a struggle, but we have the National Assembly behind us and they understand the importance and the president has directed it. And in doing that, the revenue from the government-owned enterprises tripled. In the 2021 Finance Act, we are also going to compel every government agency to comply with the provisions of the constitution that states that every revenue that they generate must first of all go to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Right now, we have several agencies of government that have different provisions in their Acts that empower them to use their revenues in so many different things. So what we are planning to achieve in the next Finance Bill which is major, is to make sure that every revenue goes into the pool and then what is due to you would be given to you, instead of the agencies spending and then deciding what goes to the government. We believe that also, would be a game changer for us in terms of revenues.\n\nBut for how long will Nigeria continue to use more than 90 per cent of its revenue to service debt, which you know is unsustainable?\n\nThat happens when revenues are underperforming. When you look at the budget, the revenue-to-debt service ratio is 40 to 45 per cent. In 2021 budget, it is 45 per cent. If the revenue underperforms, then you now have that ratio climbing high. In 2020, we had a challenge, when revenues were very low, we had some months that the ratio was up to 90 per cent revenue-to-GDP. In that case, we had to get a short-term facility from the Central Bank, to be able to support the government in terms of running its day-to-day expenditure. But we are no longer in that position. From March this year, we didn\u2019t have to borrow from the CBN and we were able to use our revenues to service debts. Also, we have also been able to raise funds in terms of borrowings as approved in the national budget, both from the domestic market as well as the external borrowing sources.\n\nYou have always blamed much of Nigeria\u2019s fiscal challenges on revenue shortfall, but some hold the view that the public service is bogged down by wastages.\n\nIt is a combination of both. We are now investing in automation as the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), for example, has been doing a lot of investments on automations, supported by some of the provisions we made in the Finance Act. For example, the FIRS has the authority to go into any system, government or private business and interrogate the numbers such as the turnover. We also have support from several sources such as the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the CBN, with data. With data, we have been able to identify people that are either not paying taxes or are underpaying and we are going after them one after the other, conducting audits.\n\nSo how realistic are your assumptions in the 2022 Appropriation Bill, especially, when you consider oil production?\n\nOil production estimated in the 2022 budget at 1.8 million barrels per day is less than the 2.5 million barrels per day installed capacity that we have. When we make the budget assumptions, we try to be pessimistic on the price and optimistic on production. The price, because we don\u2019t have control, but for production, we do have control and we do it to incentivise the oil and gas sector to be able to produce more.\n\nBut the nation has been lagging behind in the OPEC allocation quota for some time now and hasn\u2019t that also impacted revenue?\n\nThat is something that is of great concern to us. The explanation that we have from the national oil company is that at some point, we actually produce more than the OPEC quota and the regulator would authorise production to be reduced and in reducing production, it means some wells were shut down. The moment you shut down an oil well, in bringing it back up, you might not be able to get to the same level of production it was before. We were told it was a major part of the problem. Also recently, we have seen reports that there were losses that occurred due to oil theft.\n\nA few years ago, your ministry launched the Whistleblower policy as a tool to fight corruption and it was widely celebrated then. Today, there\u2019s hardly a word about that policy. Was it just an idea for the moment?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t meant to be an idea for the moment. In also trying to reinvigorate it, we have had a stakeholders\u2019 workshop to ask how best this could be utilised for us to be able to do more than we had done so far. Also, there is an aspect of it that requires legislation to protect the whistleblower. A lot of people are not willing to come up, because there is no protection for them. So there has been a bill submitted to the National Assembly, but somehow the process was stalled.\n\nSome people have the impression that the whistleblower policy was actually targeted at political opponents, especially those in the past administration. Yet, things are happening in this government and when the whistleblowers come up with information, nobody acts on them.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t targeted at the past administration. It was meant to improve reforms and also enable citizens to provide information to help the government in recovering either funds or assets that were illegally acquired. Again as I said, the issue of a lack of protection is usually a disincentive for citizens to act. So it is not political.\n\nYou have genuine reasons to stay away from the Value Added Tax (VAT) debate, but are you not worried that if the pending court judgment goes in favour of the states, it might affect the federal government\u2019s revenue base badly?\n\nNo, it will not affect the federal government, but it would affect a good number of states, especially those that have minimal contribution in terms of the derivation. Why did I say that? It is because currently, the federal government\u2019s share of VAT is 15 per cent and from what the states are advocating for, if the VAT case is decided in favour of States, then we would have the Federal Capital Territory, which is a federal government body, that currently contributes 20 per cent of the VAT. And also, you will have imports, which is a major component of Customs revenue will also go to the federal government, that\u2019s about another 15 to 20 per cent. So the federal government might end up with 40 per cent or even more. But we don\u2019t want this to happen. Why? That is because the fiscal federalism that is instituted in our constitution was designed for the strong to support the weak and that is what keeps us as a nation. So at the federal level, we are open to engaging with the states so that what is being advocated by the states that went to court doesn\u2019t happen, because it hurts federalism.\n\nBut they argue that it promotes it?\n\nSo, you would have states that have a large contribution to the derivation getting more revenue; but you might have some states that have very little or nothing. So, how does that encourage fiscal federalism?\n\nYou said last month that the fiscal authorities were working with the Central Bank of Nigeria to close the gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates and of today, there are some improvements, with the parallel market rate appreciating to about N525/$ from as high as N575/$ about a month ago. What measures did you introduce to achieve this?\n\nI would like to say that it would be good for you to hear from the Central Bank about that. All I can say is that I am in support of the work the CBN is doing and Nigerians should realise that you don\u2019t achieve results in one day. You set up policies, a lot of them very well intended, sometimes you get immediate results and a lot of time, it takes time to get the results. We hope that within the medium term, the gap that exists within the NAFEX market and the black market, which the central bank does not agree with, narrows. This is because it is important for businesses and the government. So the measures the monetary authorities are taking were designed to control price, to control inflation and also to better manage the exchange rate.\n\nBut one other thing that would also support exchange rate stability is the government\u2019s ability to attract FDIs. The president has been travelling in recent times trying to woo foreign investors, what is your government telling potential investors about Nigeria?\n\nThe president\u2019s message is that Nigeria is open for investments and also sitting one-on-one with investors, trying to know what they expect from us. That is why we are investing in basic infrastructure that businesses require. That is because no investor would want to go to a country, where they would still have to provide their own power, roads, and others. The investments we are doing in infrastructure are designed to bring in FDIs that would bring in long-term capital that would stay in this country. Recently, we went to the international capital market to raise Eurobonds of $3 billion, but we ended up with $4.2 billion in terms of interest. That shows you that discerning investors actually see the great potential that we have in the country and are willing to stake their resources in this country. As a people, we oftentimes do a lot of disservice to ourselves.\n\nWhile there are things that are not working well, there are some things that we have done well, but we don\u2019t talk about them and we just concentrate on the negative things. People might think they are hurting the government of the day, but what they are actually doing is hurting the nation. This is the only nation that we have that we can call our own. I just wish we can be a little bit more patriotic, knowing that this is our country; this is where our children are and we all have the responsibility to make sure that our nation continues to be stable.\n\nOne of the complaints from foreign investors is the ease of doing business. There is the issue of multiple taxation and it scares foreign investors away. What is the government doing to address that?\n\nReally, that is a problem. But we\u2019ll continue to work with the states to make things better. At the federal level, through the Finance Bills, we shall continue to improve the fiscal laws to avoid those duplications as well as block leakages and to provide incentives that are meaningful and that would help the investors. There are some states that are reforming their tax environment. I know of two states that have been able to repeal all laws and levies and they have just one tax law and one tax authority collecting all taxes, be it company income tax, property tax, or whatever. And when that state did that, it saw its revenue grow astronomically. So there is a benefit in doing that. The state governments are being supported by the federal government to enhance their public financial management. One of the ways we have done this, apart from supporting the states, is that we have also put in place the States\u2019 Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) programme, which is funded by the World Bank.\n\nIt is a performance-for-result programme, whereby every state was asked to list key reforms that they would undertake. If they do that, they earn some revenue and it is not a loan. So SFTAS became so popular and we saw the states competing against each other, because it is a pool of funds. Also, we saw states becoming up to date in the audit of their financial statements, publishing their budgets so that it is open and doing a number of things that needed to be done that were not being done. This programme became so popular that we are doing another round of it, which is $750 million. We\u2019ll continue to find ways to incentivise as well as encourage the states to do more.\n\nIt is true that too many taxes and levies hurt businesses and the newest programme we have, apart from the SFTAS version two, is one we are designing with the states to improve the ease of doing business. We also designed it in the form of performance-for-result. For example, they are required to automate their land registration. Lagos and a few other states have done that, but a lot of the states have not. That is, if you automate your land registration, you get some points and you earn some money. So there is another performance-for-result programme that we are designing with the states and the World Bank that would help to enhance tax reforms, so that this multiple taxation you mentioned would be addressed.\n\nFunding the 2022 budget deficit is to come from domestic and external borrowings. Is the $3.4 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund going to form part of the funding sources?\n\nYes, the $3.35 billion SDR from the IMF would be part of our external borrowing for the 2022 budget.\n\nTalking about revenue shortfall, how are you addressing wastage in public service?\n\nWe are doing that by the process of automation and the provisions in the Finance Act about state-owned enterprises and by monitoring and enforcing the law. The Treasury Single Account is one very important tool that we have put in place, that is helping us to enhance our liquidity management. Also is the Government Integrated Financial and Management Information System (GIFMIS). It is a system whereby all government payment transactions are processed. The Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS) is another tool that we are using. The IPPIS is being enhanced by bringing on board its HR component.\n\nWhat was your experience with the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS)?\n\nThe VAIDS was an incentive programme that was open for 12 months and then extended for six months. It was a period within which a defaulting taxpayer was given relief to come clean and file their taxes without any penalty. It worked at that time in terms of incremental revenue that wouldn\u2019t have come if that programme wasn\u2019t implemented. But what VAIDS left for us wasn\u2019t just the revenue that we collected, but the data that we were able to get from it. We got the data of the taxpayers that were not in the tax net.\n\nAre you likely to reintroduce it because of the benefits you talked about?\n\nIt is a double-edged sword. It is not something you want to do on a continuous basis. But there is a similar programme to VAIDS; it is called Voluntary Offshore Assets Regularisation Scheme (VOARS). Nigerians or businesses that have funds offshore can also freely declare their funds. But in this particular scheme, there is a cost, unlike VAIDS. There is a certain percentage of what they declare that would be forfeited to the government. Once they bring in that money, they are free to invest it in Nigeria. That is led by the Attorney General of the Federation, because there are several bilateral agreements and treaties that take place between Nigeria and different countries.\n\nBy the second half of 2022, fuel subsidies would cease to exist as the NNPC becomes a full commercial entity, operating in line with the Petroleum Industry Act. Have you started engaging the labour unions and other stakeholders on the proposed phasing out of fuel subsidy to avoid strike or any other distortions to economic activities?\n\nThere is a special committee that is engaging with labour that is chaired by the Minister of Labour, the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning, Ministry of Petroleum Resources and several ministers that are engaging labour on an ongoing basis. To implement the provisions of the PIA, we have made provisions in the 2022 budget that the withdrawal will take place from July, 2022. But what we are doing is to look at a situation whereby there is some kind of support that is provided to a certain pool of citizens. This involves providing funds to the citizens directly to act as a buffer and the period is part of the thing that is being negotiated. It may be a minimum of six months to nine or 12 months. It is supposed to be like an allowance to support citizens and we hope to be able to cover a minimum of 20 million, up to 40 million citizens. But the condition is that you have to be registered and you must have a national Identity card; you have to be under a certain income bracket and once you meet the criteria, the money goes to you directly in the form of transport.\n\nGoing by recent experience, there is a likelihood that the National Assembly might jack up the aggregate budget of N16. 39 trillion. In the event that this happens, is that not going to compound your fiscal challenges, especially, budget deficit?\n\nI hope that doesn\u2019t happen because we have been trying to bring down the budget deficit which is slightly above the FRA at 3.05 per cent. The National Assembly is also sensitive about the size of the deficit. Yes, I know that in the past, they have increased the revenue and at the same time, increased the expenditure. We hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but if it does, we would try as much as possible to ensure that it is contained.\n\nIn the 2022 budget proposal, Defence, comprising the entire military and police, attracted the highest allocation. But the Nigerian Army has declared that its own allocation was grossly low. Are you likely to help?\n\nThere is nothing I can do about that, because whatever we provided is what is possible. Even if we give the Nigerian Army the whole of the N16 trillion budget, it still would not be enough. We also have to provide for education, health and other sectors of the economy \u2013infrastructure. Yes, security is important, that is why it has the highest size of the budget.\n\nDuring a recent public presentation, you did say the government would review sectors eligible for Pioneer Tax Holiday Incentives under the Industrial Development Income Tax Relief Act (IDITRA) as well as dimension the cost of tax waivers/concessions, and evaluate their policy effectiveness. Can you provide more insights into this?\n\nThere is a fiscal policy committee of the government that is reviewing the various incentives that the government has provided to businesses and Pioneer Status is just one of them. But what we want to do is to make sure that the incentives we are giving, that we are getting value from it. For example, the Pioneer Status is meant for businesses to plough back those taxes that were waived for them into the business, so that their businesses grow and they employ more people. In a lot of cases, that is not what happens. Some businesses would just repatriate that money that they would have paid as taxes. So we are reviewing and redesigning the incentives so that, once what we have on ground reaches their sunset date, the new ones that come into place would be more beneficial to the country.\n\nThis is the last full year budget of the Buhari administration as well as one preceding the election year. What are the unique features that the government has factored into the budget in line with these considerations?\n\nOur view is that the government is a continuum and whatever government that comes into power would still need to provide a significant amount of its budget for security as well as health and education. So we don\u2019t anticipate that there would be anything different from what we are doing right now. We are confident that whichever government comes would continue to implement the 2023 budget and also they would look at the NDP that we have started implementing.\n\nWhat are your takeaways from the pandemic experience and do you think the country is in a position to withstand a similar shock in the future?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a wildcat that was never supposed to happen but happened across the world. I pray that it doesn\u2019t happen again, because it is difficult for an African economy to experience that kind of shock.\n\nAs you recently alluded to, there is a direct relationship between governance, poverty, and insecurity. How realistic is the president\u2019s target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty and how do you intend to achieve that?\n\nThe president has said he would lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years. We did a National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, which has been commissioned by the president. There is a National Steering Committee that was set up, because a lot of the work needs to be done by the states, because the people are in the states. The major focus is to support MSMEs and to create jobs. So we are carefully selecting and providing support to businesses based on the number of jobs that they would create and to also reskill and up-skill our people, especially, the youth, mostly in the use of ICT, because that provides the best opportunity, even for self-employment and employment across board. We are also enhancing agricultural productivity by moving into agro-business \u2013 enhancing the value chain by processing more of the food that we produce and also reducing wastages due to post-harvest losses that we suffer.\n\nYou are the finance minister, under this government, Nigeria was rated the poverty capital of the world, how do you feel with such a label on your country?\n\nI feel very bad about it. I feel it is an unfair label and I feel it has to do with not having enough awareness on the things that we are doing and also us not putting forward the data on what we have done. If what has been done by this administration was taken into account, then, we would not be labelled the poverty capital of the world.\n\nFinally, as the Finance Minister, where do you stand on the proposed deduction of $418 million Paris Club refunds from states and local governments\u2019 accounts to pay some consultants? Are you in support of it and if not, what is your position about it?\n\nThe position of the finance ministry is just to implement the position of the court.

          "text": "\u00b7 Usman: warning ill-advised\n\n\u00b7 Deal decisively with insurgents, Chief of Army Staff charges security forces\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nWith some 100,000 civilians, security personnel, members of paramilitary groups, and aid workers killed, and over three million people displaced, with about N3.6 trillion property destroyed in a 12-year insurgency waged by the Boko Haram terrorist group in the North-east, a threat by the United States to impose an arms embargo on Nigeria has ruffled feathers. Many are wondering whose is served to deny arms sale to Nigeria. Is it the interest of terrorists? Does the United States and its Western allies want to cripple the country on the pretext of rights abuse so terrorists and bandits can ride to power?\n\nNonetheless, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya, told officers and men of the Nigerian armed forces and other security agencies engaged in the battle against insurgents to deal decisively with them in order to restore peace to the troubled areas. Yahaya said this yesterday in Minna during a chat with journalists, after a closed-door meeting with officers and men of the armed officers at the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) headquarters.\n\nA recent research paper prepared for the European Peace Facility (EPF), an European Union project for peace support operations across the globe, stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), had launched 500 attacks on military bases and formations of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) between 2015 and 2020\n\nThe paper noted that between 2015 and 2020, 2,368, \u201cuniformed personnel fatalities were recorded.\u201d\n\nYet, the United States threatened that Nigeria risked arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the country.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, had threatened that his country could apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nWhile the US has demonstrated considerable commitment in partnering with Nigeria to contain terrorism, especially with the recent delivery of 12 A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets purchased by Nigeria and the training of military personnel, the comment by the US top official left security experts wondering the actual position of the US in the war against insurgency.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, a former army spokesman, Brigadier-General S.K. Usman (rtd), advised the US government to withdraw the threat of imposing arms embargo on Nigeria.\n\nUsman said, \u201cI do not think that arms embargo is advisable. The US should rescind its threat to impose arms embargo on Nigeria. The Nigerian government should also review its relations with the US.\n\n\u201cCameroon, Niger, and Chad are steeped in human rights abuses, yet they have good relations with them. Nigeria has done a good job fighting insurgency for 12 years. Sometimes it looks as if there\u2019s something else behind all these issues about human rights violations. Nigerians who are providing all these information to US from which they reach such decisions should also have a rethink.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPeople should know that once Nigeria as the most populous black nation is in trouble, the rest of Africa is in trouble. It is important that we solve our problems ourselves.\u201d\n\nA top military official, who pleaded to remain anonymous, also faulted the comments by Blinken, saying a lot is on-going between the two countries presently that should not have warranted an embargo threat from the US official.\n\nThe official stated, \u201cThere is a lot going on between US and Nigeria not to warrant such an embargo. We recently inducted 12 fighter aircraft; there are training programmes on-going.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with the US has improved greatly. A lot is going on presently. I am not saying nothing is happening but I don\u2019t see that (arms embargo) happening.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government recently commenced a subtle celebration of an impending victory over terrorists in the North-east, following the surrender of 17,000 fighters of Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nUnder the President Good luck Jonathan presidency, the US government led by then President Barrack Obama and other Western nations had denied Nigeria access to arms on the allegation of human rights abuses. That had led to resort to self-help and black market procurement of arms that turned out inferior to the arms wielded by terrorists.\n\nIn a recent interview with THISDAY, Defence Spokesman, Maj Gen Olufemi Sawyerr, said the Armed Forces of Nigeria were winning the war against insurgency and armed banditry.\n\nSawyerr said, \u201cWe are winning the war in the North-east and North-west and the terrorists are surrendering in large numbers.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that it is now that we are clearly winning the war that such report is coming up to drag us back? We are winning the war and thousands of them are surrendering with their families. What else are we saying?\u201d\n\nThe US Embassy in Abuja had, last week, following the submission of the panel report on last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests in Lagos State, urged the state and federal governments to take steps to address the allegations of abuses raised in the report.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahaya told officers and men of the security services engaged in the battle against insurgency to deal decisively with those causing problems for the country in order to restore peace to troubled areas of the country.\n\nThe army chief stated, \u201cWe should be more resolute and decisive when dealing with criminals.\u201d\n\nYahaya told soldiers on the frontlines not to be lenient with the insurgents because, \u201cit is like fighting a war.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we engage the bandits it is just like in a war, We kill them and take their weapons, that is what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged there were challenges, but said the bottlenecks had been identified and would be addressed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have gone round all the states in Nigeria to assess the security situation and now that I came here, I have been briefed by my officers on ground.\n\n\u201cI commend them for the job they are doing\u2026\n\n\u201cThe essence of the visit is to interact with the troops, to ginger them more to do better. The challenges across the nation have been unfolded and we are doing our best. In war like this, you can have surprises sometimes.\u201d\n\nYahaya said many people had acknowledged there was much improvement in the security situation across the country when \u201ccompared to the beginning\u201d. He assured that military would continue in that drive.\n\nYahaya promised that the army would collaborate with other security services, agencies, and stakeholders to ensure the fight was won. He urged relevant institutions and individuals to lend the security agencies a helping hand, particularly with respect to intelligence information.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThese criminal elements are living with us and if we all join hands together, we will eliminate them. Now we are making progress we have improved results. The others (other security agencies) are already collaborating with us in the area of information sharing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which is \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 million from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most-watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest-earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most-watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper-competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in-app integrations. But, as none of these payment apps is widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller microtransactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for the Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest-growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "6 Nigerian agencies unite to fight data privacy abuse by money lending fintechs",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 15, 2021, I received a message from a lending company informing me that Mrs X, someone I met in 2020 during my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), had not repaid a loan they took. I had been supposedly listed as an emergency contact.\n\nAmong other things, I was told not to believe this person if they say they have paid back, and also warn them that \u201cunfriendly measures\u201d involving the police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) were about to be taken against them.\n\nThe message ends with an ominous, \u201cYou can as well tell the debtor to remove you if you do not know about this LOAN as you will be affected as well\u2026\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 1, 2021, and I received a similar message from the same company but about a different person. This time, while I was not subtly threatened, the exact amount the person was to pay was included in the message with account numbers into which to deposit the outstanding sum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, this was someone I didn\u2019t have much contact with and had met during my NYSC.\n\nIn August 2021, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) hit Nigeria-based microloan platform, Soko Loan Company Limited with a \u20a610 million fine for data privacy abuse.\n\nAccording to Ripples Nigeria, in October 2021, though the company has paid the fine, it seems to be on the verge of a shutdown. However, there\u2019s no official statement from the company addressing this.\n\nThis appeared to be a step in the right direction and a potential deterrent to others.\n\nThis is not a new occurrence. Many Nigerians receive unsolicited and embarrassing text and WhatsApp messages from money lending companies about close friends and family, and sometimes, like in my case, barely known acquaintances.\n\nIn Kenya, the story is the same, with many people reporting the same thing. These Kenyan lending companies, like their Nigerian counterparts, give high-interest loans with clauses essentially asking users to compromise their personal data and that of others.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, Immaculate Kassait, Kenya\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner, disclosed that investigations are ongoing regarding an undisclosed number of digital lenders for sharing borrowers\u2019 confidential data in pursuit of defaulters.\n\nIn Nigeria, on Friday, November 12, 2021, NITDA announced its partnership with the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) to tackle data privacy abuse by money lending operators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, as we found out on Monday, November 15, 2021, the FCCPC is also partnering with other agencies on this issue. They are the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), and the EFCC.\n\nWhat does this mean for your data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: wuestenigel Flickr via Compfight cc.\n\nTo understand this, the functions of the different agencies would need to be reviewed. To do this, as our headline implies, imagine a kitchen setting.\n\nThe first tool here is the FCCPC.\n\nThink of the Commission as your customer care representative for any sector in the country. The FCCPC has ten strategic goals to aid its work \u2014 ensuring consumer satisfaction. So, say I contact any of the \u201cloan defaulters,\u201d and they wish to complain about the loan companies\u2019 actions, this is an excellent place to start. Let\u2019s call them the pot.\n\nThe CBN is Nigeria\u2019s apex regulator in the banking sector, granting and revoking licences in the industry while providing guidelines that must be strictly followed. Interestingly, money lending in Nigeria is regulated by the various states. The CBN appears to have little to no input in this space. So, let\u2019s call them spices.\n\nAnother important tool is the knife, and here we have the NHRC. The Commission was set up in 1995 as an extra-judicial channel to help citizens fight human rights violations. Essentially, think of them as an extra sword apart from the courts to combat human rights abuse.\n\nThe ICPC and the EFCC both fight crimes, but while the former focuses on corruption and other related offences, the latter is a financial crimes agency. If, for example, in the course of investigations, any money lending company has committed an offence under their purview, they could face prosecution. Let\u2019s call them the mallet, hammering away at criminals.\n\nNITDA, like we established here, on the other hand, has, among other responsibilities, the duty to oversee information technology innovations, and more specific to this scenario, data protection. We\u2019ll dub them water, a good base for most foods, an essential ingredient.\n\nSo, what\u2019s cooking in this kitchen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the FCCPC\u2019s official statement, all six \u201cresolved to collaborate, pursue urgent enforcement action against already known violators while investigating others, as well as criminal prosecutions where applicable. A joint task force of analysts and enforcers was also created and immediately activated.\u201d\n\nEssentially, we have a brigade of six different agencies going after all erring money lending platforms in the country.\n\nPer Hadiza Umar, Head, Corporate Affairs and External Relations, NITDA, \u201cThe Agency has received over 40 petitions from members of the public on the personal data abuse of some lending companies.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with FCCPC will lead to a more robust and concerted regulatory approach which we believe would ensure that Nigerians get the necessary reprieve from the illegal use of their personal data for money lending operations. The partnership would entail joint investigations, enforcement and possible prosecution.\u201d\n\nAccording to NITDA\u2019s statement, one of the complaints it received regarding Soko Loan was filed in November 2019 by Bloomgate Solicitors on behalf of a client. During its investigations, it found several violations involving unlawful data processing and refusal to cooperate with the Agency.\n\nConsidering the length of time between receipt of complaints and eventual fining, perhaps this partnership with other government agencies is the right way to go. Cooking up a thick broth to serve money lending operators, trying to ensure your data is protected.\n\nA few days ago, on November 11, 2021, I received a WhatsApp message from another lending platform; interestingly, this was relatively short. All it asked was that I tell the person concerned to repay the loan: no threats, no account numbers, and no mention of the amount owed.\n\nAlthough, still a violation of my privacy, could this mean companies are becoming wary? We can\u2019t conclude based on this one message, but it would be interesting to see how things pan out over the next few months.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nigerian pop artiste, Mr Eazi, to offer fans equity in his yet-to-be-released music\n\nTrading jokes and sharing stories, our Senior Reporter, Nifemi, had a chat with Oluwatosin Ajibade for the latest edition of The Experts. From name choice to possible career changes, Oluwatosin bares it all in this article: Early Access: Interview with Mr Eazi; artiste, tech bro, investor\n\nSpotify launches in two African countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: downloadsource.fr via Flickr\n\nLet the audio streaming wars continue. On Thursday, November 17, 2021, audio streaming platform, Spotify, announced its launch in two African countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.\n\nThis follows its biggest push into the African continent in February 2021, which saw Spotify launch in 41 countries, apart from South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, where it already had a presence.\n\nAccording to Phiona Okumu, Spotify\u2019s Head of Music, sub-Saharan Africa, \u201cSince launching in many parts of Africa earlier this year, Spotify has already had a warm welcome across the continent, and expanding our presence to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of the Congo will help us further support local artists and foster the local music scene.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreemium, Premium: Users can access the platform for free or pay $2.99 \u2014 5,997 Congolese francs or 1,736 Central Africa CFA francs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of the Congo, respectively.\n\nSpotify currently has 381 million monthly active users (MAU) and 172 million Premium subscribers and is on course to hit its 400 MAUs goal at the end of 2021.\n\nHowever, the company faces stiff competition in Africa from rivals like Audiomack with its unique strategy, Apple Music which has been in both countries since April 2020, Boomplay, YouTube Music and Deezer. Interestingly, both appear to have no homegrown platforms.\n\nAs of January 2021, DataReportal revealed that Internet penetration in the Democratic Republic of the Congo stood at 23.2% and 32.1% in the Republic of the Congo. Considering these numbers, it would be interesting to see how the audio streaming wars play out.\n\nA clampdown on cryptocurrencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular directing banks to close down accounts of persons thought to be dealing in cryptocurrency. This, however, saw a rise in peer-to-peer transactions (P2P), with Nigeria leading the market in Q1 2021.\n\nFast forward to November 2021, and the story seems a bit different. According to Nairametrics, Nigeria\u2019s P2P transaction volume saw a dip of 43% after rumours of a clampdown by the CBN on crypto traders this month.\n\nIn a memo reportedly seen by Nairametrics, a tier-2 Nigerian bank has ordered its employees to comply with the CBN\u2019s directive while listing 20 red flags they should watch out for. These include bank accounts receiving large numbers of daily inflows from numerous payees and accounts that operate as bureaux de change without authorisation by the CBN.\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group has advised that while no law prohibits people from holding, trading, or speculating in cryptocurrencies, it is a criminal act to use it for money laundering and other illegal activities.\n\n\u201cResist every temptation to involve yourself in huge volume of Crypto transactions that is unexplainable and questionable. If you are an OTC (over the counter) trader that does large volume of transactions, be very careful and stop dragging the industry name to the mud by collaborating with bad actors to carry out clandestine Crypto transactions.\n\n\u201cStop helping criminal politicians and government officials in looting the treasury and hiding the money trail via Crypto.\u201d\n\nDid you see these last week?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\n\u2018Piracy\u2019 website offers NFT art as free downloads.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how people see artistes. Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "title": "MTN, Airtel to face stiff mobile money competition in Nigeria",
          "text": "Since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) granted MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa approval in principle for the operation of Payment Service Banks (PSBs), a lot of competitive realignment has been taking place.\n\nChinese-owned OPay, arguably the largest mobile banking provider in Nigeria, has announced the appointment of a president and co-CEO for its Nigerian unit. Also, Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company, which in October raised a $150 million funding round, is now pushing its visibility aggressively in Nigeria.\n\nOPay\u2019s new appointment is particularly telling, not just because of the timing but also because of the quality of the recruitment. Olu Akanmu, the new president of the company in Nigeria, is a former executive director for retail banking at FCMB.\n\nAkanmu also has extensive knowledge of the telecoms industry having held the position of chief marketing officer for Airtel Nigeria from 2012 to 2013. He moved from Airtel to Insights Communication as client service director and later to MTN, where he held the position of general manager for consumer marketing for five years.\n\nSo, it is possible that OPay not only got themselves, someone, to help them drive mobile retail banking, they also can keep an eye on the steps being taken by the likes of MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa. OPay already claims it has more mobile money agents than MTN and other competitors, with over 300,000 compared with 230,000 MTN\u2019s MoMo agents.\n\nWhile Chipper Cash, with a valuation of $2 billion, may only focus on cross-border payments and transfers, and may no less be a big competitor for MTN and Airtel. In recent times, Chipper Cash has intensified campaigns aimed at creating brand awareness across the country and signed Nigerian afrobeats artiste Burna Boy as its global ambassador.\n\nMTN and Airtel would also need to keep an eye on TeamApt, which is currently in the market seeking to raise $150 million to push valuation to $1 billion. TeamApt claims 150,000 mobile money agents, 70 million transactions carried out on a monthly basis with over 14 million users, and a $3.5 billion value transacted.\n\nWhile MTN may find it a lot easier to deploy by leveraging the 230,000 MoMo agents, Airtel would need to build its army of agents to the level of existing competition to have a chance of gaining any significant market share. The telco has recently been granted approval in principle (AIP) for the Super Agent licence. Like the AIP for PSB, Airtel would need to satisfy all the requirements of the CBN within a period of six months before it gets a final super-agent licence.\n\nHowever, if antecedent is anything to go by, Airtel and MTN may have to wait more than six months for final licences to be issued. 9Mobile and Globacom were granted approval in principle for PSB by the CBN in August 2019; the final licence was issued in September 2020, approximately a year ago.\n\nRead also: PSB: Why MTN, Airtel Africa unlikely to replicate mobile money success in Nigeria\n\nIt is important to note that the number of mobile banking agents does not equate to the number of PoS terminals. As of September 2021, data from the Nigeria Interbank Settlement (NIBSS) showed there were about 307,000 PoS machines and 30,000 ATM terminals in Nigeria. The telcos would need to facilitate the provision of infrastructure in the country, and access to them has to be as easy as possible to attract new agents into the market.\n\nFinancially, both telcos may seem sufficiently prepared. MTN\u2019s vast infrastructure deployment may even give it an upper hand in the competition. The telco owns the majority of the backbone infrastructure that powers the services of its competitors. It not only provides broadband connection, but it controls about 80 percent of USSD services. It therefore would have the competition paying it while it also reaps benefits from direct services.\n\nAlso, MTN and Airtel are publicly listed companies. The South African telco is currently planning to seek additional funding through the sale of 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors. The shares are reportedly worth around $241.7 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria also successfully completed the issuance of its N89.999 billion Series II 10-year bond with a fixed rate of 12.75 percent due by 2031.\n\nThe series II Bond is the second issuance this year by the telco following the debut in May 2021. This completes MTN\u2019s N200 billion bond issuance programme.\n\nAirtel has also been busy in the funding market. In April, the telco announced it had raised $100 million for its mobile money business. So far, the telco has received a total of $500 million cumulative proceeds from the minority stake sales in Airtel Money from three investors.\n\nStakeholders say the decision by the CBN to issue an AIP to the telcos has positive implications for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nMTN Nigeria and Airtel combined boast 124.6 million voice subscribers and 96.1 data subscribers. Apart from that, MTN Nigeria through its MoMo Super Agent network has amassed 230,000 agents across the country, and given its experience as the second-largest mobile money operator in Africa, after Safaricom, deploying the same service in Nigeria would not be so difficult for the telco.\n\nAirtel Africa has also acquired massive experience operating mobile money in 14 African countries. The participation of telcos in PSB is expected to significantly impact the more than 40 million Nigerians that lack access to financial services in the country.\n\n\u201cThe CBN has finally taken a decision that is positioned to impact the implementation of financial inclusion in Nigeria. Financial inclusion is best driven by mobile networks operators because everyone has a phone that makes use of their networks,\u201d Ajibola Olude, general secretary, Association for Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON), told BusinessDay.\n\nNevertheless, the biggest challenge for the telcos may lie in the limits of the PSB licence they are waiting to receive. While their competitors, TeamApt, Chipper Cash, OPay may decide to give loans to users or even secure a licence for digital insurance, the PSB holders are not allowed to.\n\nImportantly, Nigeria\u2019s version of mobile money is different from other markets the telcos are used to. In Kenya or Ghana, MTN MoMo or Airtel Money users do not need a bank account or Bank Verification Number (BVN) to conduct a mobile money transaction. This is the requirement in Nigeria, whether or not the operator wants to use the mobile phone numbers of users to carry out transactions.\n\nThe phone numbers are connected to a bank account. It, therefore, means that MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa cannot keep deposits even though they can accept. They are not allowed to deal in the foreign exchange market directly but through channels within Nigeria.\n\nThese regulatory hoops could be the difference in revenue between the telcos and the competition. OPay has a microfinance bank licence that offers it the opportunity to resume credit services. It had suspended the loan business OKash in January, as part of containing its super app ambitions. Experts say credit and insurance offer more financial rewards, which are why digital banks such as Kuda Bank have recently increased their attention in growing the loan business.\n\nDespite the limitation, getting their PSB licences presents MTN and Airtel a great opportunity of fulfilling their long-term ambitions and may be with time their impact in financial inclusion would convince the regulator to remove the barriers.\n\n\u201cA PSB licence is like an upgrade to the MMO or Super Agent licence, especially for telcos,\u201d Oluwaseun Ayansola, a fintech expert, says. \u201cWhat do I mean? MoMo already had a mobile money operation (MMO). With a PSB licence MoMo can do more including issuing debit and prepaid cards in its own name by entering into a direct agreement with a card scheme (Mastercard, Visa, etc).\u201d",

In Kenya or Ghana, MTN MoMo or Airtel Money users do not need a bank account or Bank Verification Number (BVN) to conduct a mobile money transaction. This is the requirement in Nigeria, whether or not the operator wants to use the mobile phone numbers of users to carry out transactions.\n\nThe phone numbers are connected to a bank account. It, therefore, means that MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa cannot keep deposits even though they can accept. They are not allowed to deal in the foreign exchange market directly but through channels within Nigeria.\n\nThese regulatory hoops could be the difference in revenue between the telcos and the competition. OPay has a microfinance bank licence that offers it the opportunity to resume credit services. It had suspended the loan business OKash in January, as part of containing its super app ambitions. Experts say credit and insurance offer more financial rewards, which are why digital banks such as Kuda Bank have recently increased their attention in growing the loan business.\n\nDespite the limitation, getting their PSB licences presents MTN and Airtel a great opportunity of fulfilling their long-term ambitions and may be with time their impact in financial inclusion would convince the regulator to remove the barriers.\n\n\u201cA PSB licence is like an upgrade to the MMO or Super Agent licence, especially for telcos,\u201d Oluwaseun Ayansola, a fintech expert, says. \u201cWhat do I mean? MoMo already had a mobile money operation (MMO). With a PSB licence MoMo can do more including issuing debit and prepaid cards in its own name by entering into a direct agreement with a card scheme (Mastercard, Visa, etc).\u201d",
          "summary": "Akanmu also has extensive knowledge of the telecoms industry having held the position of chief marketing officer for Airtel Nigeria from 2012 to 2013.\nOPay already claims it has more mobile money agents than MTN and other competitors, with over 300,000 compared with 230,000 MTN\u2019s MoMo agents.\nTeamApt claims 150,000 mobile money agents, 70 million transactions carried out on a monthly basis with over 14 million users, and a $3.5 billion value transacted.\nIn Kenya or Ghana, MTN MoMo or Airtel Money users do not need a bank account or Bank Verification Number (BVN) to conduct a mobile money transaction.\nIt, therefore, means that MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa cannot keep deposits even though they can accept.",

          "title": "How new PSBs will disrupt Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s traditional banking system is exclusionary, leaving millions out of the financial mainstream. A September 2020 report by the global consulting firm, McKinsey & Co, noted that while banking in Nigeria remained an attractive sector, with over $9 billion in value pools, the vast majority of consumers are underserved.\n\n\u201cLack of access to services,\u201d the report said, \u201cespecially in rural areas, issues of affordability, and poor user experience all contribute to the frustration consumers experience right across the customer spectrum.\u201d\n\nFinancial inclusion in Nigeria is among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, lagging behind its peer group as well as countries with lower income. Within Nigerian borders, financial exclusion is highest in the northeast and northwest regions at 34 percent and 27 percent, respectively.\n\nA significant proportion of the Nigerian population (about 90%), noted a 2019 USAID funded Power Africa report, has little or no knowledge of alternative means of accessing financial services, including the use of mobile money despite having fairly good mobile network coverage in some parts of the country and high mobile penetration.\n\nThus, low mobile money awareness has led to low mobile money uptake in Nigeria, as compared with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhile the 2020 EFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria survey showed that 51 percent of Nigerian adults were using formal financial services, such as banks, microfinance banks, mobile money, insurance, or pension accounts, up from 49 percent in 2018, largely driven by growth in banking, with 45 percent of Nigerians banked in 2020, up from 40 percent in 2018, Nigeria fell short of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy targets for 2020. The country had aimed to reach 70 percent of Nigerians with formal financial services by 2020; the actual figure was 51 percent.\n\nRead Also: MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs\n\nThere has been a long-standing and broad-based consensus on the part of Nigeria\u2019s government and the central bank about the importance of boosting the provision and uptake of digital financial services (DFS). This forms part of a broader strategy to scale-up financial inclusion and, through pass-through effects, potentially to improve underlying economic conditions.\n\nNigeria has a relatively well-developed banking sector by regional standards, with a regionally high level of banking penetration (45% vs. regional average of 17.8% for West Africa) and robust use of advanced financial instruments in the local economy. The country is also well connected to international financial markets.\n\nYet, several barriers exist to leveraging digital payments for scale and Nigeria\u2019s traditional banking sector\u2019s capacity to mediate high volume credit to retail and corporate customers to drive economic growth has consistently remained subdued.\n\nS&P Global in its 2021 Global Banking Outlook report notes that Nigerian banks face struggles on many fronts, and projected the country\u2019s banks will grow slower in 2021 on the back of a subdued economy, despite the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s introduction of a minimum ratio of loans to deposits in 2019. \u201cWe forecast subdued credit growth to the private sector of about 4-6 percent in 2020 and 2021, after a strong 13.9 percent rebound in 2019, as the foreign exchange market and consumer demand stabilises. Banks will likely focus on blue chips operating across the manufacturing, trade, and telecoms sectors,\u201d the ratings firm projected.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its latest Financial Access Survey disclosed that the number of borrowers from commercial banks decreased to 29.61 per 1,000 adults in 2020 from 25.42 per 1,000 adults in 2019, despite the outstanding deposits with commercial banks per percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rising to 20.50 in 2020 against 16.31 in 2019.\n\nNigerian banks during this period closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) between 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe report also showed a sharp decline in the number of registered mobile money agent outlets in Nigeria to 129,154 in 2020 from 145,800 in 2019, representing an 11 percent decline.\n\nEnter the new PSBs\n\nSeveral market forces are set to contest the market space with established commercial banks and could swing the balance of power in favour of these challenger banks for selective banking services. Two weeks ago, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nThis was in furtherance of the apex bank\u2019s efforts to leverage technology to promote financial inclusion and enhance access to financial services for the unbanked and underserved segments of the population.\n\nThe approval, when finally firmed, will allow both telecom giants\u2019 PSBs to accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nWhile several barriers exist to leveraging digital payments for scale, Telcos\u2019 participation in mobile money payments will likely raise mobile money uptake, increase financial inclusion and simplify payment collection.\n\nPayments are fundamental to how banks interact with customers. They support most propositions and touch customers more than any other part of a bank. It is, says KPMG Nigeria, \u201cthe key battleground for the customer\u2019s primary relationship\u201d.\n\nThe new PSBs are likely to challenge the incumbents primarily on higher customer engagement, coupled with smooth transaction capabilities and volume-driven metrics.\n\nThe basic premise for the introduction of payments banks is to escalate penetration in the unbanked and underbanked population. As such, their offerings are niche and they are not allowed to provide the entire gamut of banking services, such as asset products and fixed deposits. Thus, the situation still provides traditional banks with significant headroom for growth and also an opportunity to partner with payments banks to offer their products to an unexplored customer segment.\u201d\n\nYet, the new PSBs have the potential to be swifter and dexterous, and hence more responsive to changing market trends. With a large captive customer base, few or no legacy constraints and greater responsiveness to customer needs, and with no pressure to offer full-service banking solutions, they are likely to attract a large pool of well-served, underserved as well as unserved customers.\u201d\n\nThe business of PSBs such as those promoted by MTN and Airtel, centres on providing last mile connectivity and payment facility through either physical points or through other digital interfaces, including mobile or internet-enabled platforms. Besides offering basic deposits and remittance services, the PSBs are likely to introduce smooth, real time, secure, on-the-go approaches for facilitating retail payments.\n\nIn addition, they will be entering the market with clear advantages, and are expected to operate on an asset-light premise compared to the traditional branch-based and asset-heavy model, prevalent with traditional banks in Nigeria.\n\nA KPMG\u2013UBS study indicated that the cost of effecting a transaction from a branch is 43 times, call-centre and ATM is 13 times, and internet banking is twice greater when compared to mobile transactions. Therefore, the PSBs would no doubt promote and incentivise adoption and usage of mobile and digital channels to all customer segments. Evidence from the annual KPMG in Nigeria\u2019s banking industry customer satisfaction survey (BICSS) suggests that this will be a viable strategy for PSBs. The findings from the research show that adoption rates for retail banking customers for app-based mobile banking and USSD channels rose significantly from 48 percent and 41 percent in 2017 to 55 percent and 59 percent in 2018, respectively.\n\nWhile the new PSBs would leverage existing assets and capabilities within their parent network, they would also leverage capabilities such as distribution footprint: physical footprints, established route-to-market (RTM) capabilities, mobile app platform for e-Wallets, etc. In addition, they would be igniting their business operations with a large captive customer base, existing ecosystem for sales and service: agents and distributors, and regulation and compliance skills/know-how\n\nUnlike the syncretic approach of digital/branch-based banking operations of traditional banks, the new PSBs with their digital background and experience are likely to engender positive customer experience and loyalty by facilitating digital interactions throughout the entirety of the banking value chain. Activities such as customer acquisition and onboarding, back-office operations, transaction processing, customer service, management reporting, employee engagement, etc., would also be digitally enabled. Therefore, the PSBs can offer a distinct digital experience to customers that traditional banks have been unable to.\n\nIn addition, the PSBs understand the value of the data they get access to and the insights these generate on the preferences of both individual customers and specific segments. These insights can be used to refine sales and marketing of existing products and to spur the creation of entirely new ones. These types of VAS can be powerful accelerators of digital payments by attracting customers to the platform and generating revenue outside of transaction fees.\n\nWith a combined subscriber base of some 96 million active users, both Telco\u2019s\u2019 PSBs have a strong customer base to create easy onboarding for customers. To encourage wide uptake and drive volume, both PSBs would likely take a relatively light approach to transaction fees, so as to not create the type of pricing or behavioural barriers that can otherwise be a significant challenge. This itself is a challenge to traditional banks that have made a culture out of the widely unpopular transaction fees and have been unresponsive to customers\u2019 complaints.",

Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa.\n\nBagudu, who was not specific on the exact date for the convention in February, said the convention was shifted because four states were yet to complete their congresses.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Nov. 21, the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum met, where we congratulated and thanked the Caretaker Committee for working so hard in leading the party. We also thanked the President for supporting them to deliver on their mandate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI also explained yesterday that the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum discussed the issue of national convention of the party and they mandated us to come and discuss with the President as the party\u2019s leader to give the input of the Governors so that the party and the President will consider.\n\n\u201cPart of the inputs we got yesterday was that we still have four states which are in the process of completing their congresses like Anambra; understandably because of the recent gubernatorial election, Zamfara and two others, because of logistic challenges and then, Christmas is around the corner and early January we will be very busy with Ekiti.\n\n\u201cSo, the Governors, based on all these, suggested the party and the President should graciously consider February and the President is favourably disposed to the suggestion.\u201d\n\nThe National Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, who also spoke on the outcome of the meeting, said: \u201cThe Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum after their meeting, has suggested February to the party and the President has concurred so we are going ahead to plan for the convention in February.\n\n\u201cNigerians should expect more unity and progress as a result of the forthcoming convention.\u201d\n\nResponding to insinuations that he might be delaying the convention to extend his tenure as the Caretaker Chairman of the APC, Buni said:\n\n\u201cAm I a jobless person who is always trying to extend his tenure; to do what? I have my primary responsibility as a Governor to go back to my state and carry out my primary responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhat I am here to do is ad-hoc and of course to reposition the party and that is exactly what we have been able to achieve.\u201d",

The military is involved. Police is involved. The Nigeria Civil Defence Corps is involved. If not, there is no way bunkering can continue. It\u2019s a terrible thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, whether we should take the issue of bunkering to even be more serious than treason. If you go around and see what has happened to our environment, you\u2019ll have pity on us.\u201d\n\nWike called on members of the military taskforce deployed to arrest the illegal oil bunkers to find a better and environmentally-friendly way to destroy bunkering sites in the state.\n\nThe governor said when they blow up and set those sites on fire, they increase soot in the atmosphere that have become another grave environmental concern in Rivers State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there is another civilised way to go about it, so that while you\u2019re doing the right thing, let us not die. You should find another way to reduce this soot. Unfortunately, we have no helper. On the other hand, we continue praying to God to touch the minds of these bunkers.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the war against insurgency, Wike commended the military for the success that they have achieved in reducing the level of carnage Boko Haram and bandits have caused in parts of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor, however, noted that greater success can be achieved by deploying more military strategies, which is better than media publicity.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Amao said he was on operational visit to 115 Special Operation Group in the State and decided to pay courtesy visit to governor, who has contributed immensely to the functioning of the NAF base in Port Harcourt.\n\nAmao commended the governor for the good work he has continued to do in Rivers State in terms of provision of infrastructure.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe commend you for being able to contain the security situation in the state. Rivers State has been a very peaceful State. That is why, most at times, I and the service chiefs have to focus on other places with much problems.\n\n\u201cThe governor is able to achieve this state of peace because and from the brief I got from my officers, he has been a very good coordinator and also assisted the security agencies in the discharge of their duties.\u201d",

He explained that joint security operations were currently in progress in the state\u2019s frontline areas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nResponding, the Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs stated that Government was following the developments closely, having received assurances of commitment from the Police and Military.\n\nAruwan reiterated the commitment of the Kaduna State Government by way of continued provision of logistics and support to security agencies. He described the attack as a setback, stating however that the Government of Kaduna State would not be deterred by this in its security efforts.\n\nThe Commissioner fielded questions from journalists on the shutdown of telecommunication services in frontline areas, explaining that difficult situations required difficult measures.\n\nHe disclosed that successes were being recorded as a result of the shutdown, which could not be explored in detail due to the sensitivity of operations. He pleaded with citizens experiencing communication difficulties to bear with the temporary measures in view of overall security advantages.\n\nAruwan added that the Kaduna State acting governor, Dr Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, received the briefings and sent her deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the attack, as she prayed for the repose of their souls.",

(ANSA).\n\nHelping spark the investigation was the complaint of a Nigerian woman, brought illegally into Italy, that her fellow countrywomen were taking on debts as high as 50,000 euros ($56,000) to arrive, only to be forced into prostitution for the syndicate.

          "title": "2022 Hajj not certain, mood unclear \u2013 NAHCON",
          "text": "The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has said it still remains in the dark as to the certainty or otherwise of the 2022 hajj exercise.\n\nIt said, until a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with the Saudi authority, any effort could be in the realm of speculation.\n\nNAHCON Head of Public Affairs Hajiya Fatima Sanda Usara said this in an article \u201cWorking while waiting,\u201d a copy of which was made available to Blueprint in Abuja Sunday.\n\nShe said: \u201cLike any other nation with a Muslim population going on Hajj, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, NAHCON, is hopeful that foreign pilgrims will participate in Hajj 2022. Like many other individuals and nations, NAHCON is monitoring developments in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in relation to the said Hajj season. So far, recent activities in the Kingdom gives almost everyone optimism yet, based on past experiences, it is too early to jump for joy. The signals are not strong enough to enable NAHCON make decisive statements or to give definitive directives.\n\n\u201cThus, ordinarily, an annual Hajj calendar of events would have been released by the Commission by now as a guide towards preparations for the next year\u2019s Hajj.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the uncertainties surrounding Hajj and COVID-19 constraints, developing a calendar of events presently has become a dilemma compared to past years. Firstly, no one can predict the new guidelines; policies that would shape the conduct of next Hajj talk little of setting a timeline to accomplish them.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Hajj calendars are tentative milestones for activities the Commission wishes to accomplish within a certain period before Hajj, during Hajj and after Hajj. For example, setting a date for when registration of pilgrims is expected to start and end, when pilgrims\u2019 accommodation is expected to be ready, when selection of airlines for airlifting of pilgrims is expected to be completed, selection and orientation of pilgrims officials, when caterers will be selected, setting inaugural flight dates, pre-Hajj preparations and post return journey etc.\n\n\u201cAnyone would agree that the times are yet unripe for such a calendar of events. Until a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with Saudi Arabia on 2022 Hajj, NAHCON cannot circulate a speculative Hajj calendar that might be misconstrued as a binding document. Especially with the reality of social media consequences. In fact, until the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provides an insight on what shape the Hajj would take, every nation is still in the dark.\n\n\u201cAnd would be suicidal for NAHCON to release what it has. Conversely, these uncertainties have not deterred the Commission from developing a tentative framework of action on Hajj preparations pending when the coast will be clear.\u201d\n\nUsara said, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding next year\u2019s Hajj, the commission was still on top of its game so it\u2019s not caught unawares.\n\n\u201cWhile waiting though, the Commission is test running some of its newly developed digital applications that would be launched when the fine-tuning is completed. Similarly, the Commission has been whetting knowledge of its staff through variety of trainings, capacity building workshops etc.\n\n\u201cThis is to keep its workforce abreast with modern operational techniques in various fields of human endeavor to meet up with challenges of the current period. At the right time, the Commission plans to dispatch a team of trainers to various states to sensitize them on the use of modern applications in the conduct of Hajj, and with a template on how best to organize pilgrimage under the influence of modern technology.\n\n\u201cIt is this writer\u2019s believe that many states are not docile and some are already brainstorming on best strategies in managing pilgrims that are not technology savvies in this age of Covid-19 technological innovations. These patterns of enlightened brainstorming would ease the task of coordinating Hajj and Umrah operations within a short notice if it so happens,\u201d she further wrote.\n\nUsara further said: \u201cHowever, it is heartwarming knowing that as at today, most states already have a list of registered Hajj hopefuls waiting to participate in the Hajj. Apart from that, some states are decisive on termination of registration of new pilgrims. And among all these anticipatory steps, Kogi state has made history as a pioneer in migrating all its registered pilgrims into the Hajj Savings Scheme.\n\n\u201cThis gives deposits of its pilgrims the added advantage of accumulating profit while waiting. This also means that by the time the Hajj fare is determined, the Kogi state pilgrims would pay additionally lesser than non-Hajj Savings Scheme intending pilgrims might have to pay.\n\n\u201cOne of the moves the Commission has made in recent times is to persuade government to intervene in some of the charges that might accrue on pilgrims as a result ofCovid-19 test protocols. This is with a view of alleviating the extra burden that might be placed on the pilgrims.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Commission would continue to work with all stakeholders for the common interest of Nigerian Muslim intending pilgrims to Makkah.\u201d",

Kekemeke of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court 4 on allegations of corruption bordering on abuse of office and gratification.\n\nICPC had filed six counts before the court in which it accused the council chairman of demanding and receiving N10 million bribe from the Director of Remotosh Construction Limited, Aremu Omotosho, in exchange for approving payment for the construction of a double-cell culvert in Paiko-Kore.\n\nThe local council boss was alleged to have committed the offence in March 2018 when he directed the contractor to transfer the money to his lawyer handling his election tribunal case, thereby violating Sections 8 (1)(a), 10 (a)(i), 18 (b) and 19 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000.\n\nREAD ALSO: Police Arrest Suspected Bandits\u2019 Spiritual Leader In Niger, Others\n\nOne of the charges read, \u201cThat you, Adamu Mustapha Danze on or about the month of March 2018 at Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, while being a public officer as the Executive Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council received the sum of N10 million from Engineer Aremu Omotosho, the director of Remotosh Construction Limited for approving payment for the construction of double cell culvert at Paiko-Kore awarded to Remotosh Construction Limited by Gwagwalada Area Council, the sum you asked the contractor to transfer to your counsel defending you in the election tribunal and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 10 (a)(i) and punishable under Section 10 (a)(ii) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000.\u201d\n\nDanze, who had a bench warrant issued on him, pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him while the warrant was subsequently dismissed by the trial judge after a plea by the defence Counsel, Abdul Mohammed.\n\nMohammed, in his remarks, apologised to the judge for failing to attend proceedings on two previous dates fixed by the court, saying it was due to the recent kidnapping activities in Gwagwalada.\n\nHe also informed the court that the defendant was coordinating rescue operations in the area council, and moved a motion praying that the accused be admitted to bail at the discretion of the court pending trial.\n\nCounsel to ICPC, Michael Adesola, in his counter-argument, averred that the accused was very deliberate in his actions of ignoring court sittings as he was duly served all proceedings since last year.\n\nAdesola, who also opposed the bail application, prayed the court to remand the accused in a correctional facility to prevent him from interfering and intimidating witnesses, some of whom were employees in the area council.\n\nJustice Kekemeke, having listened to both counsels, held that the defendant cannot jump bail based on his current position.\n\n\u201cThe defendant who is the current Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council cannot evade his trial,\u201d he held. \u201cHe has nowhere to hide as I give him the benefit of doubt. The application therefore subsists. Bail is therefore granted to the defendant.\u201d\n\nDanze was admitted to bail in the sum of N20 million and a surety in like sum while the case was adjourned until March 1, 2022, for trial.",

Kennedy.\n\n\u201cNigeria was among the first countries in the world to receive development assistance under the Agency in 1961.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFor six decades, USAID has built its reputation as the world\u2019s premier international development organisation by partnering with more than 100 countries to strengthen communities and improve lives.\n\nThe Mission Director in Nigeria, Anne Patterson was quoted in the release to have said: \u201cOn this anniversary of President Kennedy\u2019s vision of the United States as the world\u2019s leader in providing a helping hand to countries struggling to develop, I am proud to represent USAID in Nigeria, a country with tremendous potential to be leader in West Africa if it can overcome its many challenges.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria and around the world, USAID partners with some of the world\u2019s top development agencies, the United Nations, local nongovernmental and civil society organizations, and host country governments to help save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen governance, and improve health, education, and economic prosperity.\n\nIn 2021, USAID is spending $787 million in development and humanitarian assistance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, perhaps USAID\u2019s biggest ongoing success in Nigeria has been its response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic that has wrought the country since the 1980s. Through funding from the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Walter Reed Army Research Institute, culminating in a 2019-2020 \u201csurge\u201d that greatly reduced a rising trend in vulnerable areas, especially in combination with the ongoing tuberculosis and new COVID-19 pandemics. Today USAID supports testing for 2.4 million Nigerians a year, and provides free life-saving antiretroviral therapy for 89 percent of the nearly 400,000 individuals who have tested positive.\n\nThe statement revealed that another 62 million Nigerian mothers and children benefited from USAID health programmes last year through training of public health workers, increasing access to quality medicines, and improving leadership in the health sector with a focus on primary health care.\n\nUSAID support has protected 68 million Nigerians from malaria by donations of mosquito nets through the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI), which has contributed to a drop in child deaths by 16 percent over 10 years and helped reduce malaria prevalence from 42 percent to 23 percent.\n\nThe statement said since 2015, USAID interventions in Education have helped millions of children and youth improve their lives through better early grade reading skills, and focus especially on more than 340,000 children whose education was suspended through conflict.\n\nThrough Feed the Future, 2.3 million smallholder farmers benefited from improved products, improved techniques, and access to markets and financing through USAID agriculture programs last year. Power Africa reforms will improve an enabling environment and increase private investment in the energy sector, and strengthened management of water systems to increase access to reliable water and sanitation.\n\nUSAID Democracy and Governance programmes support free and fair elections, 230 civil society organizations working for more responsive governance and local solutions to ongoing economic and ethno-religious tensions between farmers and herders.\n\nThe statement said that USAID is the biggest bilateral donor of Humanitarian Assistance to Nigeria, donating about $343 million in commodities and logistical support to ensure the displaced have enough to eat and access to basic health and human rights.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission has said fighting terrorism without attacking the root causes is an exercise in futility.\n\nThe Commission, which traced the root causes of terrorism in the West Africa to cases of weak governance, poverty, youth unemployment and human rights abuses, lamented that Boko Haram attacks in the Lake Chad Basin alone in the last 10 years have led to more Han 30,000 deaths, with terrorism displacing over three million people in the region.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the Early Warning Study on the Spillover of Violent Extremism to ECOWAS Coastal Member State in Abuja, the Vice President of ECOWAS Commission, Madam Finda Koroma said: \u201cIt would be illusionary to fight against terrorism without attacking its root causes, such as bad or in some cases, weak governance, poverty, youth unemployment and human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nShe said data from the ECOWAS Alert and Response Network (ECOWARN) shows terrorist incidents perpetrated by Boko Haram alone resulted in more than 30,000 deaths, in less than 10 years of subversive activities, in addition to the physical attacks on the populations and the territorial integrity of ECOWAS\u2019 s member states.\n\nShe lamented that terrorism has unprecedented humanitarian consequences, stating that to date, more than three million people are displaced.\n\nKoroma said: \u201cAfter North-East of Nigeria, the Lake Chad Basin, the Sahel, the Nothern Part of Mali, the threats escalated in the Liptako-Gourma region; made up of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. From the North of Mali and Burkina Faso Violent Extremist groups conducted years back attacks in the southern Part of these members states.\n\n\u201cSince 2019, the southwestern regions of Burkina Faso have seen an escalation of jihadist presence from JNIM\u2019s Katibat Macina, who are present in the Cascades region and in the forests along the Ivorian border. This explains why C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire saw a major escalation of violent extremism throughout 2020, including its first jihadist attacks since the 2016 Grand Bassam incident. We all remember the Park W Pendjari abduction in Benin.\u201d\n\nShe noted that under the instructions of the Heads of States, the ECOWAS Commission has been working to address this multifaceted issue, with the goal to achieve peace and security in the region.\n\nShe disclosed that: \u201cWith regard to these root causes in the prevention and the fight against terrorism, the ECOWAS Commission has made the \u201cnexus\u201d between security and development its major area of focus.\u201d\n\nShe revealed that various strategies and programmes have been put in place to combat terrorism in the region.\n\nKoroma however said the fight against terrorism does not rest solely on member states or the ECOWAS Commission, and to this end, \u201cin the joint policy statement, the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government have called on the international community, development partners, relevant international organisations and civil society organisations to coordinate their activities with ECOWAS Commission.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the launching, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama said the impact of the responses on counter-terrorism going on in various areas of operations requires terrorists to find climes where they can retreat and recuperate, noting that ungoverned spaces and places where state presence is weak or absent provide the perfect conditions for such activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll member states affected must therefore put more efforts to eliminate these conditions that facilitate the activities and movements of terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that: \u201cIt is my view that only concerted regional initiatives such as this can help us to better understand the dynamics of the security challenges facing us and hopefully, we can agree on the best strategy for curbing the menace of terrorism and violent extremism. Without a doubt, terrorism threatens the free movement of persons, goods and services, which represents the core values of our regional integration agenda.\u201d\n\nOnyeama, who was represented by the Director, Africa Multilateral Affairs, Ambassador Ngozi Ukaeje said: \u201cIt is evident that the Kinetic approach towards combating terrorism is yielding positive results but that alone cannot provide the total solution. There is need for more emphasis to be placed on non-kinetic approaches to complement the kinetic approach.\u201d\n\nHe noted that: \u201cNigeria is applying Kinetic measures in the fight against terrorism with intelligence-led operations such as Operation Hadin Kai, Military super camp strategy, integration of Civilian Joint Task Force into the fight against terrorism which have successfully dislodged terrorist strongholds.\n\n\u201cEqually, non-kinetic approaches such as the launching of operation safe corridor which serves as a de-radicalisation, rehabilitation, and reintegration programme for repentant terrorists have yielded positive results. Nigeria has therefore witnessed a lot of progress in this approach which has provided an avenue for hundreds of terrorists to lay down their arms and surrender to our security forces.\u201d\n\nOnyeama also agreed that: \u201cTo effectively combat the menace of terrorism and violent extremism, we must also address the root causes of the menace. Social challenges such as poverty, unemployment, inequality can result to the existence of a breeding ground for potential recruitment of affected persons into terrorist folds, if not properly addressed.\u201d\n\nHe however assured that \u201cNigeria will work closely with the ECOWAS Commission to ensure that the actions we shall be taking, in preventing terrorists and violent extremists from crossing our borders into our coastal regions would not negatively affect the regional economic integration agenda.\n\nThe Representative of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), James Aji said the launching of the study is very relevant and timely for the region, adding that: \u201cIt comes at a time when there is increasing talk about the reality and impact of the spread of terrorism from the Sahel to coastal states.\u201d\n\nHe however raised the alarm that: \u201cIf we do not take action swiftly, the spread of terrorism to coastal states could be devastating to the region, especially given the fact that this spread would meet the major security threat of piracy and insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mix of terrorism and violent extremism as we know it today in the Sahel and maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea would be potentially explosive.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
