          "text": "\u2026Reps kick as operators shun investigative hearing, threaten action\n\nLeke Baiyewu, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has threatened to take legal action against airlines and other operators who fail to comply with the extant laws concerning persons living with disabilities in Nigeria. It condemned the situation where it becomes difficult for the category of persons to enjoy public facilities, especially the airports.\n\nThe National Commission for Persons with Disabilities said it is already in talks with the Ministers of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; as well as the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation engaged to construct new airport terminals across the country.\n\nThe commission\u2019s Executive Secretary, James Lalu, disclosed this in Abuja on Tuesday at an investigative hearing organised by the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Disabilities on \u2018The Need to Investigate the Alleged Violation of the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act by the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria and Private Airline Operators.\u2019\n\nLalu said, \u201cSincerely speaking, for us in the disability community and the National Disability Commission, we find this act by this airline completely disappointing. To discriminate against a PWD, you must have that very strong negative perception towards PWDs before you could be able to do that.\n\n\u201cWe see this as something of national interest and we thank the committee for raising this. The right of PWDs today in Nigeria is non-negotiable. We are here as a commission to defend this right. \u201cTherefore, when we receive some of these complaints, we try to look into these policies that most of these airlines continue to sign. The policies remain worrisome to us as a disability community.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring to their notice that the existence of the Discrimination Against Persons with Disability (Prohibition) Act already criminalises any form of discrimination of towards persons with disabilities in totality.\u201d\n\nLalu noted that the commission had been engaging with the aviation ministry on how to address the issue of policies being introduced by airlines which lead to abuse of the law.\n\nHe stated that the commission was ready to assist regulators and operators in facilitating movement and services for PLWDs at the airports.\n\nLalu said, \u201cWe are ready to train even the staff from the airlines and staff from Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. We are ready as a commission. There are a lot of partners that approach us on this. We are ready to partner with them.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, we are meeting with the Minister for Transportation and the Ministry of Aviation to address this. It is a matter of accessibility in the airports and a matter of accessibility for our own railway services. So, our people would be comfortable where they go.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the airlines that are here that enough is enough. We try everything possible to address this through the administrative way but once it gets out of hand, the commission is ready to take any airline to court.\n\n\u201cThe provisions in the Act, it does not take any rocket science for you to be able to read and understand. It is clear there. It is a thing that all the airlines must be able to provide these services. If you can provide the steps for people with their legs to climb at the airport, why must you not provide things for PWDs?\n\n\u201cThis is the time for us to address this. Our people have suffered. Enough is enough! For many years, we have been discriminated against in airports. Once I leave Nigeria to another country, you see how they try to handle me; I feel like a king anywhere I go. But once I get back to Nigeria, it becomes difficult.\n\n\u201cWhy are we trying to make life difficult for our own people? If you are complete, does that mean you are better than some of us? God can move you to any place. As soon as you are alive and you have not entered the grave, then, God has not finished your creation. In one minute, you can become a member of the disability community. I was born, I did my primary and secondary school; I was hearing completely. Then, sickness struck me and I lost my hearing abilities. If I am not hearing, then, are you more intelligent than us?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the committee, Miriam Onuoha, in her opening remarks, decried that most of the airlines failed to attend the hearing despite public notices and invitations to them.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt was extended to them but we have just about three of them. It is just for the records. Before the end of the meeting, we hope to have them in attendance. But if we do not have them in attendance, then, the committee will decide on the necessary steps to take, going forward.\u201d\n\nOnuoha added, \u201cI want to use this opportunity to address and make a passionate appeal to the general public that one of the core mandates of this House committee is to advocate the welfare and rights of persons with disability. This committee will stop at nothing or letting anything deter us from carrying out this mandate.\n\n\u201cWe use this opportunity to enlighten the general public on the provisions of this Disability Act and the need for the public to respect the provisions and the rights and welfare of persons with disability. I don\u2019t think issues and matters and the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities should be treated lightly or with disdain.\n\n\u201cWe will like the general public to take away any form of discrimination and stigma that is attached to disabilities.

          "text": "By Evelyn Usman\n\nThe 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, Victoria Island, Lagos , has inaugurated a committee to investigate land disputes between serving and retired Army officers and civilians in Lagos and Ogun states.\n\nThis move which is on the directive of the Chief of the Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaha, is coming on the heels of complaints of harassment and acts of brutality and land related litigations against personnel of the Division.\n\nInaugurating the five-man committee yesterday, the General Officer Commander, GOC 81 Division, Major General Lawrence Fejokwu, charged members to establish a mechanism for the amicable resolution of land disputes between soldiers and civilians.\n\nAccording to the GOC, \u201c Their task is to make sure our personnel, individually, do not get involved in land that they bought rightly or wrongly. Rather, they should complain to the committee so that the committee can help them through such cases. In the same vein, communities who feel that some uniformed people come to harass them can also approach the committee with their complaints, where it will be looked into.\n\n\u201c We have been inundated with various complaints from both our personnel and communities. It is either the communities run to us to complain that soldiers are invading their lands, or our soldiers are complaining that they bought lands over time that have appreciated and the communities resold such lands and want to relocate them to other lands. This is taking another step towards solving the problem of land disputes in 81 Division\u2019s Area of Responsibility involving our personnel both serving and retired\u201d.\n\nThe GOC however, clarified that sometimes, soldiers who go about harassing communities, were discovered to be impersonators. He said with the committee on ground, Army personnel, whether serving or retired are not allowed to tackle land disputes themselves.\n\nHe stated that \u201c The idea behind this committee is that any personnel within the division\u2019s area with land issues should approach the committee, tender documents and the committee will look at it and if it is valid, the committee will go as 81 Division representatives to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cIf a soldier runs foul of a land purchase agreement, the committee will tell him the same. It is also a forum where issues will be aggregated and data generated. If our data tilts to the fact that the problem lies with soldiers not taking physical possession within stated timeframes, it is left for us to begin to educate our soldiers on areas they run afoul of the law. So, once you buy, try to begin to develop. If, on the other hand, we find out that the communities are trying to take advantage because the land has appreciated, we will also move as a division to tell them they cannot do that to our personnel.\n\n\u201cThese agreements sometimes should be made flexible. For instance, when will a soldier who may be in theatre of operation for two or more years have time to come and develop a property he bought within a year? We hope this approach will solve the problem of communities trying to revoke land already sold to our personnel on the one hand and on the other, stop the idea of soldiers taking laws into their hands out of frustration\u201d.",

          "title": "Why African Leaders must demonstrate interest in finding lasting peace in Ethiopia \u2014 Goodluck Jonathan",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Special Envoy mediation mission in Mali. Former President Goodluck Jonathan has challenged African Leaders to demonstrate a special interest in the current quest for lasting peace in Ethiopia so as to provide a platform upon which democratic ideals and political leadership that are workable within plural societies can be guaranteed on the African continent.\n\nFormer President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan who weighed into the political crises playing out in Ethiopia also urged both the central government and authorities in the troubled region of Tigray to come to some understanding and end the hostilities that are currently threatening the lives and property of the people there.\n\nDr. Jonathan who was the Keynote speaker on Tuesday evening at the the J-K Gadzama 13th Annual Lecture in Abuja reasoned that the intervention of African leaders in Ethiopia would demonstrate a considerable interest in the peace process in Ethiopia, as a guarantee for peace and stability on the continent as well as a demonstration to the world that Africans are capable of working out their differences.\n\nDelivering a paper titled, \u201cRedefining Democracy: Yearnings of the Minority in a Democratic Setting\u201d, he urged African leaders to practice democracy of inclusion and not the one that would alienate the minorities and increase tension in the polity.\n\nIn his charge to the leaders in Africa, Dr. Jonathan said, \u201cI call on the central government, and the regional government of Ethiopia to come to some understanding and end hostilities there. I also call on African leaders to show considerable interest in the peace process in Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cIn some places where democracy failed, it was probably because a section of the population which felt insecure and vulnerable had embarked on the unfortunate mission of taking up arms against the state.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that happen in some African countries. We are witnessing a similar scenario playing out in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cFor any country to make sustainable progress, it has to devise ways of integrating all its ethnic, religious and demographic groups, and harvesting all its resources from across the length and breadth of the nation. A nation progresses, and its development gets duly consolidated, when both majority and minority potentials are aggregated for enduring strength.\n\n\u201cAny society that blocks off a percentage of its population, because of the politics of majority rule will not go as far as it could have, because a significant percentage of human resources and endowments that reside within the minorities will not be adequately deployed to catalyse national growth, \u201d President Jonathan warned.\n\nHe continued by informing the audience at the virtual event that, \u201cthat is why nations that offer equal opportunity to both men and women tend to do better in all indices of human development than those that permit discriminatory policies. A good example is Finland where gender does not count in the scheme of things and in the affairs of the nation.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Founding Principal Partner, J-K Gadzama Law Firm, Chief Joe-Kyari Gadzama pointed out that, \u201cDemocracy is more likely to develop and endure when all segments of the society are free to participate and influence political outcomes without suffering bias, interference or reprisal.\n\n\u201cIts is therefore on this premise that we examine the \u201cYearnings of Minority\u201d and take a critical look at \u201cRedefining Democracy\u201d to reflect the intents and goals of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThankfully, we have some of the best minds in our midst that will do justice to the topic of discussion providing a long lasting solution in the roadmap of our nation\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cIt is based on this background that I consider it a rare privilege to have His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR, GCON, the former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to speak on the topic.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency is democracy personified as he is a man who is not only a firm believer in the ideals and tenets of democracy but dreams, lives, speaks and breathes democracy.\n\n\u201cHis singular action averted a rather gloomy prediction about Nigeria and brought a paradigm shift and food for thought for leaders in Africa,\u201d Gadzama told the audience.\n\nSome of the dignitaries who have served as Chairmen and Special Guests at the previous editions of the Lecture series include, Former Head, Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan; The 14th Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi II as well as Former Chief Justices of Nigeria, Justice Mohammed Uwais, Justice Alfa Belgore, Justice Mahmud Mohammed, Justice Walter Ononngen and the incumbent Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed.\n\nThe series has also paraded notable dignitaries as Guest Speakers. They include, a renowned lawyer in the United Kingdom, Prof. Oba Nsugbe who served as the Guest Speaker in 2008 and an expert from Infrastructure Finance Corporation, U.S.A., Dr. Gerald Tanyi who was the Guest Speaker for the 2009 Leture series.\n\nOthers include a distinguished senior member of the Bar, Aare Afe Babalola who was the Guest Speaker in 2010; a distinguished elder and senior citizen, Prof. Jerry Gana who delivered the lecture as the Guest Speaker in 2011 and Former Minister of Information, Mr. Frank Nweke (jnr) who was the Guest Speaker in 2012.\n\nThe Guest Speaker at the 2014 Lecture series was a leading legal practitioner based in the United Kingdom, Alan Jones; the Guest Speaker for the series in 2015 was honoubable Justice C.C. Nweze; but by the time the 2016 series of the Public Lecture was hosted by the same organizers, the Guest Lecturer was a respected senior lawyer and pioneer Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu.\n\nThe 2017 lecture series was addressed by an eminent lawyer and first female Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief (Mrs) Folake Solanke; the Guest Speaker for the lecture series in 2019 was a Former Vice-President of the World Bank, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili while the Guest Speaker at the 2020 series of the lecture was the Chairman Dialogue Group of Companies Limited, Dr. Mahdi Shehu.\n\nPresident of the Nigerian Bar Association who was one of the four-man panel of discussants at Tuesday;s event, Olumide Akpata pointed out that, \u201cif there is any institution that will protect the rights of the minority, it is the judiciary.\n\n\u201cConversations that are based on justice, equity and fairness in a plural society like ours would make the agitations by the minority groups recede into the background.\n\n\u201cI want to seize the opportunity of the platform provided by this event to stress the fact that it is incumbent on our leaders in this country to look closely into the issue of National Orientation to find other ways of addressing the problem of minority agitation in the country.\n\n\u201cThose in the level of leadership should pick up the challenge and create platforms for national integration that we must continue to promote like the National Youth Service Corps and the Unity Schools across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a Benin boy, I was a student of the Kings College, Lagos but as we speak today, I have brothers scattered across every part of the country. If our leaders would pay some attention to this suggestion, it would make everyone to have something to hope for as a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cBefore I leave this event, I see the need to emphasize the fact that as Nigerians, if we want to move forward together and become one of the great nations of the world, we must pay due attention to resources allocation so that minority agitation would be silenced permanently in the country,\u201d Akpata submitted.\n\nChairman of the Public Lecture who sat through the three hours of the event through a virtual participation, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mallam Muhammad Bello warned that as long as Nigerians are unpatriotic, the road to the greatness of the country would be rough.\n\nDelivering a closing remarks, the Minister said, \u201d In my view, the critical thing that has been disturbing the wheel of progress in this country is patriotism.\n\n\u201cPeople in positions of authority should be God-fearing, just and be equitable,\u201d he concluded to draw the curtain on the event which held for the first time within the S.M.A. Belgore Hall, J-K Gadzama Court, Abuja in compliance with the Covid-19 protocols on social gatherings.\n\nOther discussants present at the event were the Chairman House Committee on Judiciary, Hon. Onofiok Luke and the Chairman Young Lawyers Forum, Mr. Tobi Adebowale.\n\nRoyal Ftahers at the eveny include the Amayanabo of Bonny, King Diette Spiff and prominent Traditional ruler from Bayelsa State, King. A.J. Turner.\n\nFormer President Jonathan was accompanied to the event by the Former Deputy Governor of Edo State and Former Chief of Staff to the President, Chief Mike Oghiadomen; Former Attorney General of the Federation, Muhammad Bello Adoke; Former Minister for Special Duties, Alhaji Tanimu Turaki and Former Minister of State for the FCT, Yeye Jumoka Akinjide.\n\nOthers include the Former Deputy Governor of Nassarawa State and Former Minister for Information, Mr. Labaran Maku; Former Chief Whip, House of Representatives, Hon. Mohammed Bawa; Former Chairman FERMA, Engr. Olajide Adeniji and Former Member House of Representatives, Hon. Tijani Kiyawa among others.",

In a referendum, we will not\n\nbe voting for a candidate, we will be voting to make a choice on a given proposition. That proposition will be: \u201cI WANT A YORUBA REPUBLIC SEPARATE FROM NIGERIA? Each voter will be able to vote YES or NO.\u201d he explained.\n\nAkintoye advised millions of Yoruba people within and beyond Nigeria to vote in support of a petition created by some members of NINAS that is being circulated.\n\nYoruba Nation, others: Nigeria should let citizens willing to secede go \u2013 Akintoye\n\n\u201cWe might use the Petition to pressurize the Federal Government (that is the National Assembly and the Federal Executive) to grant us our Referendum. However the chances are that the Federal Government will answer no.\u201d\n\nImplying on how the referendum could be granted, the professoa aaid the group would not take no for an answer if it approached the state governments to grant the referendum.\n\n\u201cWhat we will need is intense pressure persistently applied. We must not take no for an answer.\n\nAccording to him, alternatively, the group can take the petition to the United Nations to organise the Referendum, noting that organs have done such in many countries including South Sudan to break away from the Republic of Sudan.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our Petition supported by millions of us is a great weapon to get our Referendum. So, we Yoruba must all make a rush to vote for the Petition that is now being circulated by NINAS\u201d, Akintoye, said.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Godwin Tsa and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government and the House of Representatives clashed yesterday over the suspension of Twitter.\n\nOn June 4, government banned Twitter after the microblogging site pulled down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn reaction, the House mandated its Committees on Information, Communication and Justice to investigate the legal backing for government\u2019s action.\n\nAt the resume hearing yesterday, government said it suspended operations of the micro-blogging and social networking site in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who appeared before the lawmakers, alongside the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), insisted that the suspension had nothing to do with the pulling down of Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe also read the riot act to Facebook and other social media operators saying government would not hesitate to wield the big stick if they crossed the red line.\n\n\u201cWe suspended Twitter because Twitter became a platform of choice for those that want to bring down this country. If any other platform does it, we will suspend their operations too. It is because there is a country called Nigeria that they have business here. Social media is a menace everywhere in the world. We believe that the best way to start is regulating them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIncidentally, the Twitter suspension is indefinite; it\u2019s not banned. The doors are not closed. We are willing to speak to Twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I did issue a statement which I announced the government\u2019s team that is ready to meet Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhen I leave here, I intend see whether we can have a preliminary meeting of that committee. We hope that the committee will be able to meet first and that the committee would have a good dialogue with Twitter. But like we said, there are two basic things that Twitter or any OTT or social media needs to do: they must first be registered as a Nigerian company after which they will apply for license. Other conditions will come up as we go along.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the minister had said that the Federal Government has said that it suspended the operations of micro-blogging and social networking site, Twitter, in the country in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\n\u201cIf you look at section 3 of the National Security Act which cloth the State Security Service with the powers to preserve the internal security of Nigerians, it is very instructive that any platform that threatens the internal security of Nigeria will not be allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where the Federal Government deemed it necessary that the activities of twitter in Nigeria in particular is inimical to stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by section 45 of the constitution in light to the provisions of section 5 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2011 which states that any person who knowingly, in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or render support or the commission of an act of terrorism or to a terrorist group commits an offence under this act.\n\n\u201cWe all know that IPOB is proscribed by a High Court in Nigeria and yet, twitter is the platform of choice through which IPOB direct its people to kill soldiers, kill policemen and burn public institutions.\n\n\u201cSo, it is clear that Twitter operations in Nigeria is inimical to our growth, both in common law and national security and so, we had to suspend their operations.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the joint committee, Shaba Ibrahim, said while he agreed that everything pales into insignificance when national interest and security is at stake, government\u2019s action smacked of incipient totalitarianism.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of people who handle social media irresponsibly. All it took to wake to that responsibility was for Twitter to bring down Mr President\u2019s tweet. With all due respect sir, I don\u2019t think that was good enough.\n\n\u201cI agree that no right is in absolute terms. But again, we must mind the timing of it so that proactive actions are taken to nip these things in the bud, because what you have done whether you like it or not looks like symptoms of emerging totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the court of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) has restrained President Buhari and agents of the Federal Government from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and other social media service providers, media houses, radio and television broadcast stations and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe ruling of the court was predicated on the suit filed against the government by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians where they argued that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana (SAN) and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nLai, Pantami make govt\u2019s reconciliation team\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved a Federal Government\u2019s team to engage with Twitter over the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the composition of the team in a statement in Abuja by Segun Adeyemi, special assistant to the President on Media, office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nThe team which is chaired by Mohammed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, and representatives of relevant government agencies as members.\n\n\u201cFollowing the indefinite suspension of its operations in Nigeria, for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, Twitter wrote to President Buhari seeking to engage with the Federal Government over the suspension, with a view to charting a path forward,\u201d the statement read.",

We are already witnessing positive outcomes from our investment in the safety and viability of our waterways as a safe alternative to road transportation.\n\n\u201cIn the last one year, LAGFERRY has moved over 500,000 passengers across our waterways, including the Super Eagles, who were successfully ferried to and from Benin Republic for their AFCON qualifying match. In addition to commuting people, it is heartwarming to know that LAGFERRY promotes tourism and commerce by providing logistics solutions to business owners who move their trucks and cargoes through the waterways within Apapa and through regular charter services.\n\nSanwo-Olu also urged the private sector to invest in water transportation, saying the economic potential is limitless.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we will continue to support private sector participation in water transportation by putting in place the most appropriate regulatory framework for high returns on investment.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the state was building and rehabilitating 15 jetties and dredging the waterways to open up more jetties for public use.\n\n\u201cOur administration will continue to prioritise absolute safety on our waterways by ensuring total compliance with safety protocols and\n\nregulations including regular use of life jackets by both operators and passengers, conducting seaworthiness inspections bi-annually, and removing wrecks from navigable channels. We will not relent in doing our best for Lagosians and making their daily commute safe and less stressful. We have concluded plans to boost our water transportation safety measures and protocols with the deployment and installation of technological devices for improved navigation, the development of nautical charts and the purchase of state-of-the-art patrol boats and safety equipment to upgrade LASWA\u2019s SAR unit.\u201d\n\nManaging Director of LAGFERRY, Abdoulbaq Ladi-Balogun, said the seven new boats brings the total number of boats to 20 running concurrent commercial operations.\n\n\u201cWe boast of an impressive safety record as we can proudly tell you that we have never recorded any accident since the agency started commercial operations on February 6, 2020.\u201d",

The charge was later amended to three counts.\n\nOtedola, while giving evidence as the fifth prosecution witness, said the defendant demanded $3 million from him with a threat to indict his company.\n\nThe businessman said he proceeded to report the issue to the Department of State Services (DSS) and was given $500,000 in marked notes. Also, the DSS had planted a camera in Otedola\u2019s house.\n\nEarlier, Justice Otaluka dismissed the preliminary objection filed by Farouk Lawan against his trial to set the stage for his conviction.\n\nDismissing his preliminary objection to trial, yesterday, Ms Otaluka said the argument of the defence lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, that Mr Lawan was not a public officer going by the Section 2 of the ICPC Act was untenable.\n\nThe judge held that a public officer is anyone who occupies a public office and who is remunerated with public funds as against Mr Ozekhome\u2019s argument that Mr Lawan was a \u201cmere political office holders.\u201d\n\nJustice Otaluka held that Lawan acted in breach of section 17 (1) (a), section 8(1) (a) (b) (ii), and section 23 (i) of the Corrupt practices and other Related Offences Act, 2000, and committed an offence punishable under section 8 (1) 17 (1) and 23(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe court said it was satisfied that the ICPC successfully established a criminal case against the defendant.\n\nWhereas the defendant was handed seven years jail term on counts one and two of the charge, the court sentenced him to five years on count three.\n\nJustice Otaluka held that the sentence would run concurrently. Lawan was the chairman of an ad hoc committee set up by the House in 2012 to investigate massive petrol subsidy fraud.",

          "text": "Refers bill to appropriate committee\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has hinted that the 2021 Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by President Muhammadu Buhari for approval may be passed next Tuesday.\n\nLawan dropped the hint Wednesday while speaking after the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, had led the debate for the second reading of the N895.84 billion supplementary budget for 2021 fiscal year.\n\nHe, therefore, referred the Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by the president on June 15 to the Senate Committee on Appropriation headed by Senator Jibril Barau.\n\nLawan, who gave the directive after the supplementary appropriation bill passed the second reading on the floor of the Senate, asked the committee to submit its report Tuesday next week.\n\nAccording to him, the report of the panel would be submitted, considered, and passed the same day.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Tuesday, June 15 transmitted the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly for consideration and approval.\n\nThe supplementary budget bill was transmitted via a letter dated 15th June, 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter which was read Tuesday at the commencement of plenary after a 12-day recess by the Senate to mark the second legislative year of the ninth National Assembly, explained that the amount captured in the Bill was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health-related expenditures for treatment of additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states; as well as to procure additional equipment captured in this year\u2019s capital expenditure on defence and security to tackle prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\nThe president also explained to the senators that the supplementary budget will be funded through existing facilities sourced from the World Bank as well as available new facilities.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cLet me seize this opportunity, to express my deep gratitude, for the cooperation and support, of the Leadership and Distinguished Members of the Senate, in our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and address the various security and other challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to prepare the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill considering the urgent need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) have now developed a Covid-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinized these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, additional funds are required to meet our commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in States (NCAPS), as the amount provisioned in the 2021 Appropriation Bill for this purpose was inexplicably cut by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for public service wage adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe Supplementary Budget request is for a total sum of N895, 842, 465, 917 (Eight Hundred and Ninety-Five Billion, Eight Hundred and Forty-Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventeen Naira) only.\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund N45.63 billion of the N83.56 billion required for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme by drawing on existing World Bank loans (which would be restructured) as well as Other Grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\n\u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent component of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emergency areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says AGF studying court ruling on twitter\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move media stakeholders have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who spoke Wednesday with newsmen after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), however, said although it is an initiative of government which only the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, can address.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is not strictly a Presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has given approval that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that the peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts. While 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\n\nThat is the only thing we can talk about FEC today. If there\u2019s any question, then I\u2019ll gladly take. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe media adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But I can tell you that it was between the 20th and 24th that we had to do all the cases,\u201d he had noted.\n\nAfterwards, Obafunwa had also explained the findings of the autopsy for each body.\n\nAccording to him, the first person was brought in from Lekki bridge, and was discovered to have suffered laceration on a side of his skull, but died as a result of bleeding on his \u201cchest cavity and \u201cblunt force trauma to the chest\u201d.\n\nObafunwa explained that the second male was declared dead in the early hours of October 21, after suffering an open skull fracture, but the pathologist added that there was no sign of gunshot injury.\n\nHe said the second body showed signs of having suffered hypertension, as well as rib fracture, but noted that the cause of death was \u201cskull and brain injury which was due to blunt force trauma\u201d.\n\nFor the third body, the pathologist said examination revealed that the person died of severe blood loss as a result of complications suffered, following a gunshot injury.\n\nAfter giving his testimony, Obafunwa was asked to appear again before the panel on June 19 with reports on the 96 remaining bodies.",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap. It\u2019s a part of his visual identity.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a new license for digital stock trading to Chaka technologies limited.\n\nThe commission\u2019s Sub-Broker Serving Multiple Brokers Through a Digital Platform License will enable Chaka to offer stocks directly to Nigerian investors. The licence also lets the company work with multiple stockbrokers and help digitise their services.\n\nFounded in 2019, the Chaka offers over 4000 stocks from the US, the UK, China, and Nigeria. Along with players like Bamboo, Trove and Risevest, the investment-tech space has been gradually expanding.\n\nWhile Chaka did not have a stockbroking licence at the time, it struck a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Limited for Nigerian stocks and DriveWealth LLC for its foreign stock offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer its legal page, the startup did not manage investor funds itself, as that was the purview of licenced brokers; it simply served as a digital outlet that brings the capital market to a wider audience.\n\nHowever, in December 2020, Chaka received a surprise as SEC issued a court order that effectively restricted it from offering stocks to the investing public.\n\nIn April 2021, the regulator followed this up by warning investment-tech platforms to desist from offering US stocks to Nigerians.\n\nA changing structure?\n\nTosin Osibodu, CEO, Chaka\n\nTosin Osibodu, CEO of Chaka, reveals that the company has been actively engaging SEC since the circular was first released in December 2020.\n\nOsibodu reveals that the new digital sub-broker licence would change its investment operations structure as it would no longer need to operate through a broker.\n\n\u201cWe now have direct oversight from SEC. So the customer is aware that all the funds and his entire account are supervised directly by the SEC,\u201d he reveals.\n\nThough SEC has not published a specific regulatory framework for the Digital Sub-broker licence, an April 2021 amendment to the SEC rule indicates that the regulator now fully recognises the presence of investment-tech platforms.\n\nAccording to SEC, the \u2018\u2019Sub-broker Serving Multiple Brokers Through a Digital Platform\u2019\u2019 uses a digital platform to serve clients and interact with the sponsoring broker or brokers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Osibodu, Chaka can now help regular stockbrokers digitise their services.\n\nThis new licence category requires a $24,300 (\u20a610 million) paid-up capital requirement, a Fidelity bond covering 20% of the paid-up capital, and four application fees that cumulatively cost $1200 (\u20a6500k).\n\nWhile Osibodu does not confirm if this licence addresses SEC\u2019s warning against offering foreign stocks, he affirms that it will be business as usual for its customers. Osibodu\u2019s affirmation implies that the company would continue offering both local and foreign shares to investors.\n\nNigeria\u2019s vast and diverse fintech space is replete with sub-sectors that either have defined or undefined regulations. But that appears to be changing.\n\nPer its recent circular, the commission wants fintech companies without defined regulations to undergo an incubation program from Q3 2021.\n\nThough SEC has not issued an official framework on the new sub-broker licence, other industry players would likely follow suit. Meanwhile, the regulator might be coming up with more defined regulations that would, in its words, \u201cPromote innovation, and bring more people into the Nigerian Capital market.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve examined previously, it would take a lot more than technology to boost Nigeria\u2019s capital market, and any regulatory reform that promotes this would be a welcome initiative.",

          "text": "Airtel Uganda has announced the separation of Airtel Money from its Telecom business on Tuesday, 22nd June 2021. This means the phone-based service has been transferred to its affiliate, Airtel Mobile Commerce Uganda Limited (AMC Uganda).\n\nThis separation follows Uganda\u2019s National Payment Systems (NPS) Act, 2020, passed on 4th September 2020. The regulation was announced in an official newspaper on 5th March 2021.\n\nPer Section 9 of the Act, the Bank of Uganda announced the issuance of two licences to AMC Uganda on May 24, 2021.\n\nThe first licence is a Payment Service Provider \u2014 Class A Licence, Number PSP 01/21 \u2014 which authorises the company to offer electronic Airtel Money services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second licence is a Payment System Operator Licence \u2014 (Electronic Money Systems), Number PSO 01/21 \u2014 which authorises AMC Uganda to operate a payment platform (Airtel Money).\n\nThus, in Uganda, AMC will conduct all Airtel Money services while partnering with and through the licensed telecommunications network of Airtel Uganda.\n\nThe separation will result in the migration or sharing of the Airtel Money accounts and related information with the new company.\n\nMoreover, Airtel Uganda will now focus on the operations of telecommunication infrastructure and the offering of telecommunications services to its network subscribers and licensed operators.\n\nRecall that in 2015, a commercial High Court ruled against five telcos \u2014 MTN, Warid, Uganda Telecom, Airtel, and Africell \u2014 operating mobile money in Uganda, saying that mobile money operations were illegal.\n\nThe pronouncement followed a petition by Abdu Kantunu, a Bugweri County Member of Parliament, to have mobile money regulated under the Financial Institutions Act of Uganda.\n\nThe reason was that the companies were registered as telcos and not as financial institutions, which means the Bank of Uganda did not license them.\n\nFollowing this recent separation, AMC Uganda is now regulated and supervised by the Bank of Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReportedly, the Ugandan government intends to enhance financial inclusion, especially for the rural population, via access to financial service by separating telecommunication services from financial services.\n\nWhile customers may be worried about the new change, Manoj Murali, Managing Director, Airtel Uganda, assured customers that the split doesn\u2019t change their services.\n\nHe clarified that the affiliate company, AMC Uganda, will provide Airtel Money services to registered subscribers of Airtel Uganda with the same terms and conditions.\n\nSimilarly, MTN Uganda promised to hand over its financial services and change its name from MTN MoMo to MTN Uganda Limited on June 1, 2021. It also assured customers that financial and telecommunication services would be normal following the separation.\n\nThis seems like a common practice in a few African countries.\n\nIn 2015, Ghana broke-up its telecommunication services from financial services, ensuring that all institutions offering the latter are regulated under the Banking Act, 2004 (Act 673).\n\nAlso, Kenya Information and Communication (Amendment) Bill 2019 could force its telecom operators in Kenya to separate financial services from telecom services if approved.\n\nIn 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reportedly sent a circular to telecom companies, among other non-financial institutions, to apply for licences to become payment banks.\n\nThis involves setting up a separate company and depositing a minimum capital of $13 million (\u20a65.3 billion). Only 9mobile and Glo have been granted a licence, while Airtel and MTN are yet to.",

Who do you think is most likely to collapse first? (Think like Yahoo, BlackBerry, Kodak etc). P.S: I know there isn\u2019t a huge chance of this, but just rank them in order of likely to unlikely (to collapse). Just to get an idea of how solid they really are. Advertisement\n\nTeam responses ensue\u2026\n\nThen comes Oghenekaro\u2019s answer, increasing order of unlikelihood:\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook CEO, Mark Zuckgerberg\n\nFacebook has the weakest business model in my opinion. If there\u2019s a mass exodus from Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp today due to cancel culture or something (and there are several competing products rising in their space right now), I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll survive.\n\nThey basically have only Oculus to rely on for revenue, and even then, that won\u2019t cut it as profit margins there are quite slim.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even counting what\u2019s more likely to kill them \u2014 government regulations.\n\nVerdict: Probably a very quick death for these ones\n\nGoogle (Alphabet)\n\nPhoto on Photostockeditor\n\nMore than 80% of Google\u2019s revenue is still stuck in Ads. With regulations on cookies and tracking constantly biting at them, and the fact that they have offered too much stuff for free, it\u2019ll be hard to make up that 80% in any reasonable time if for some reason they can\u2019t advertise.\n\nVerdict: Most likely a slow death\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\n\nThey have been desperately trying to diversify incomes recently but almost everything they offer is still closed in their ecosystem. Their major attractions are quite fickle if you think about it.\n\nFirst one is their ecosystem, which is pretty great because all their stuff works well together.\n\nBut if one of their products fails or is out innovated by someone else, they could lose many users across all their products, because their other products won\u2019t play nice.\n\nSecond attraction is their social allure and brand, but a brand can go from 100 to 0 pretty quickly (remember BlackBerry was king of social proof before they went down).\n\nIf for some reason their devices stop being trendy or there\u2019s a new trendy thing, then they lose almost all they have.\n\nVerdict: Slow or quick death, it depends.\n\nAmazon\n\nPhoto by Rich Bamford https://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/29934487872\n\nI consider Amazon to be tied with Microsoft for least likely to collapse for similar reasons; their money primary comes from governments, institutions and massive enterprises (including Apple).\n\nWhat\u2019s common with huge organisations is that they are extremely resistant to change, so even if a better technology comes along it\u2019ll take a while before Amazon Web Services (AWS) starts losing business.\n\nRunning nearly half of the entire internet is quite a feat.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s still their mainstream Amazon.com, where they have every other person\u2019s business (hardware, ads, software, even on demand streaming and more).\n\nVerdict: I don\u2019t know how these ones can die.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSimilar to Amazon in the enterprise space. Add that to their Surface line, Windows, Xbox, Office and whatever else they\u2019ve got running.\n\nVerdict: Like Amazon, I can\u2019t predict how they can die",

          "text": "In a curious case of twisted law of economics, luxury real estate still finds buyers in the Nigerian property market despite the downturn in economy that has seen incomes drop and consumer purchasing power shrink considerably.\n\nA luxury real estate or home is one that is valued within the top 10 of such properties on the local market. Such properties tend to be considerable in size, located in optimal areas, constructed and finished with high-end materials.\n\nThey are designed with uncommon architectural details and exceptional amenities, and therefore they command and people pay premium prices to acquire them. Usually, luxury real estate suffers market lull in a troubled economy such as Nigeria\u2019s, and immediate follow-up of such a situation is high vacancy factor resulting from subdued demand.\n\nBut this is not the story in the Nigerian market where, though the economy is bad, developers are still putting products on the market and people are buying as if all is well with the economy and purchasing power of individuals.\n\n\u201cThere is huge cash supply caused by the dollar-naira exchange rates. A lot of people, especially the wealthy people in society, are seeking a home for this cash and real estate is about the one and only viable destination,\u201d MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, explained to BusinessDay.\n\nBalogun noted that most of the people who buy do so as an investment, citing Diaspora Nigerians and footballers who, according to him, earn hundreds of pounds and dollars monthly. \u201cThese people don\u2019t buy to live but to invest; these are patient cash; they are not bank loan,\u201d he added.\n\nSince there are still vacancies, now hovering between 30-50 percent, in well-built properties within luxury areas like Ikoyi or Victoria Island, it is clear that the driver is not excess occupier demand, according to Dolapo Omidire, research director at Estate Intel.\n\nRead Also: Sterling Homes at 11 lifts 25,000 families off property market, impacts economy\n\nHe affirmed that luxury residential property developers are taking advantage of the greater liquidity that high net-worth individuals (HNIs) and other individuals with non-institutional capital seemingly have.\n\n\u201cThe developers are sponsoring new projects that these owner-occupiers and \u2018store of value investors\u2019 are eager to buy in spite of high vacancies or rental volatility. As more of these projects start and eventually get sold out, a handful of the units may not be leased or will remain vacant,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhat is happening in the luxury real estate market, apart from being unsustainable, is not a true reflection of the economy but, as Balogun put it, a fallout of government policy that allows people outside the country to import their money home.\n\nThe true reflection of the economy, relative to the property market, is that, because of lay-offs and salary cuts in many organizations as a result of the slowdown in the economy, many people have downgraded their accommodation requirements.\n\nMany of the middle-level workers in the oil and blue-chip industries, who used to occupy posh and large-size apartments, have come down to one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. Some of them who lived on the island have migrated to the mainland, pushing demand and rent for small-size family units in places like Surulere, Ilupeju, Gbagada, Okota, Amuwo Odofin, etc to unimaginable levels.\n\nAnother reason for the curious rise in demand for luxury real estate is corruption in governmental systems where public office holders who embezzle public funds find real estate a ready haven for the stolen money.\n\nAt a recent media programme in Abuja, Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), described the real estate sector of the economy as a major conduit for money laundering in the country.\n\nThe chairman noted that 90 to 100 percent of stolen public funds are used for the procurement of houses and lands, citing a case of a female minister who bought $37.5million property from a bank manager and deposited $20 million cash.\n\nThough Chudi Ubosi, Principal Partner at Ubosi Eleh+Co, does not see what is called luxury properties in the Nigerian market as a luxury in the real sense of it, describing what is happening in the market as pent-up demand, Udo Okonjo, CEO, Fine and Country West Africa, sees some benefits in investing in that space.\n\nOkonjo cited Victoria Island where she mentioned gain in property values and capital appreciation as part of the benefits in investing in luxury real estate, pointing out that VI is a prime location at the nerve centre of Lagos upscale market, financial and business district.\n\n\u201cProperties located in this area will continue to reap economic gains and increase in value. More lucrative jobs, businesses, and recreational activities will continue to enter this marketplace. The effect is an increase in demand for office spaces, business outlets, and housing,\u201d she said.\n\nCompared to other investment assets like bonds and stocks, real estate has lower risk. Its prices will continue to increase through economic constraints long term because of its intrinsic value. In Victoria Island, for instance, luxury real estate is limited in supply due to a fixed amount of land.\n\nLuxury properties attract high net-worth individuals who can afford luxury lifestyles. Because of luxury living in prime locations, there is a strong demand for luxury homes, which is why investors scramble for the limited space in the upper-end locations to cite their investment.",
          "summary": "In a curious case of twisted law of economics, luxury real estate still finds buyers in the Nigerian property market despite the downturn in economy that has seen incomes drop and consumer purchasing power shrink considerably.\nA luxury real estate or home is one that is valued within the top 10 of such properties on the local market.\nAnother reason for the curious rise in demand for luxury real estate is corruption in governmental systems where public office holders who embezzle public funds find real estate a ready haven for the stolen money.\nCompared to other investment assets like bonds and stocks, real estate has lower risk.\nIn Victoria Island, for instance, luxury real estate is limited in supply due to a fixed amount of land.",

We also know that some brought their private jets under a temporary import certificate, which has expired and not renewed. These are infractions.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the verification, some of the things we want to expose will come to light. We will make our findings known on July 6 after the expiration of the 30-day grace window. Those in default risk detention of their aircraft as nobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nAttah added that the Customs management believes that owners of private aircraft are highly placed individuals who would be willing to comply with extant laws governing the importation of the aircraft they own; including payments of all appropriate duties and taxes.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government responsible for enforcement of laws governing imports and exports in Nigeria, NCS will not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions on any defaulting private aircraft owner immediately after the expiration of the verification period on Tuesday 6th July, 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, private aircrafts owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff & Trade Departments, Nigeria Customs Service headquarters, Abuja, from 10am to 5pm. Between Monday 7th June to Tuesday 6th July, 2021\u201d, Attah explained.\n\nHe added that the required documents for verification are; Aircraft Certificate of Registration; NCAA\u2019S Flight Operations Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Maintenance Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Permit for non- Commercial Flights; and Temporary Import Permit where applicable.\n\nThe Customs Spokesman emphasized that the ongoing verification was not intended to inconvenience any owner of a private aircraft, as such individuals or representatives can come with the documents for verification.\n\n...",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "Following the October 20, 2020 gunshots, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos State Government conspired and surreptitiously transported 20 dead from the Lekki Tollgate to the state pathologist for autopsy, according to SaharaReporters.\n\nThe Lagos State Pathologist, Prof John Obafunwa, conveyed this revelation confidentially to members of the Lagos State EndSARS panel sitting in Lekki, according to a top source.\n\nThe bodies of the Lekki Tollgate victims had already spent three days in the mortuary before being brought before the Pathologist for an autopsy, according to a source familiar with events at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cOn October 24, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos state government transported 20 Lekki massacre victims to a pathologist in Lagos, but they claimed they were persons attempting to get out of Ikoyi prisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bodies had been at the morgue for three days before being transferred to the pathologist, which is interesting. This is in addition to the 99 bodies they admitted to taking to the pathologist previously, three of which were from Lekki Tollgate, according to the source.\n\nOn June 5, Obafunwa, the Lagos State government\u2019s consultant pathologist, first stated that between October 20 and 24, last year, 99 bodies were deposited in the mortuary of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. Only three of them, he was told, were from Lekki.\n\nNigerians around the country took to the streets in October 2020 to protest police brutality and terrible governance as part of the #EndSARS campaign.\n\nSoldiers from the 81 division\u2019s Bonny Camp, however, attacked the Lekki tollgate, where some demonstrators had congregated, and fired rounds on October 20.\n\nSince the tragedy, there has been debate on the number of people killed.\n\nObafunwa said 99 bodies were received for autopsy between October 20 and 24 during a session of the judicial panel set up to probe the soldiers\u2019 invasion of protesters.\n\nApart from the three bodies believed to have come from Lekki, Obafunwa said the rest were brought in from Surulere, Ikorodu, Ajah, and Fagba, among other places in the state.\n\n\u201cThey told us to conduct autopsies on victims that arrived between the 20th and 21st of January and up to roughly the 24th of January, and we did the autopsies on bodies from Ajah, Surulere, Ikorodu, Fagba, and Ikoyi prisons, totaling 99. But I\u2019m only bringing the three for Lekki,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe pathologist indicated he would have to check his records for the exact date and hour the remains were received.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how many bodies arrived on the 21st. I\u2019d have to go check them out. But I can tell you that we have to finish all the cases between the 20th and the 24th,\u201d he had added.\n\nObafunwa then proceeded to discuss the autopsy findings for each victim.\n\nAccording to him, the first victim was brought in from Lekki Bridge and found to have sustained a laceration on one side of his skull, but died as a result of bleeding in his \u201cchest cavity\u201d and \u201cblunt force injuries to the chest.\u201d\n\nThe second individual was declared dead in the early hours of October 21 after sustaining an open skull fracture, although there was no trace of gunshot injuries, according to Obafunwa.\n\nHe added the second body had hypertension and rib fractures, but the cause of death was \u201cskull and brain injuries related to blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pathologist, the third body died of substantial blood loss as a result of complications from a gunshot wound.\n\nObafunwa was invited to return to the panel on June 19 with reports on the remaining 96 remains after giving his testimony.",

While it is true that an initial appropriation of the above stated sum was made due to the decaying nature of the National Assembly Complex which has not witnessed any major maintenance or overhauling since construction, the said amount was reduced to 9 billion naira after the breakout of COVID-19 pandemic. Even with this reduction, the sum of 9 billion or any amount is yet to be cash backed or released to the National Assembly. None of this amount is even appropriated for the National Assembly bureaucracy or its leadership. It must be reiterated that the National Assembly Complex is a National Monument which falls under the purview of control of the Federal Capital Development Agency. In essence, the FCDA is responsible for its maintenance as well as renovation and not the Leadership of the National Assembly as being falsely bandied about. The leakage witnessed at the foyer of the National Assembly yesterday justifies the apprehension of the leadership of the National Assembly and the FCDA and further underscores the need for an urgent intervention in revamping the dilapidated structures within the complex before it falls into further dilapidation with the attendant huge cost of a possible replacement.\n\nSigned\n\nSenator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru Ph.D.\n\nSenate Spokesperson\n\nDated this 23rd day of June, 2021",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Lagos State Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola on Tuesday told the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality other related abuses that injuries recorded in the aftermath of the Lekki shooting were predominantly fractures, machete wounds, and minor cuts.\n\nHe said the #EndSARS protest was hijacked by hoodlums who infiltrated the ranks of the protesters to carry out violence.\n\nAs proof of this testimony, Mr Muri-Okunola showed the panel visuals and slides from the Lekki toll gate protests.\n\nHe also testified that in the wake of the violence, the governor and his team visited the hospitals on the night of October 20, 2020, and saw that most of those who presented for treatment had fractures, machete cuts, and minor wounds.\n\n\u201cThere were about 13 persons injured at Reddington Hospital, and 12 injured at the General Hospital, Marina. The doctors in charge said one of the patients that was being moved to LASUTH, had more severe injuries from machetes\u2019 wounds.\n\n\u201cAt the time we were there, most of the injuries were all in the nature of cuts, bruises from machetes\u2019 wounds, and stampede. Nobody at the hospitals said they were shot at.\n\n\u201cThe next day, the governor appealed to residents in a broadcast to stay calm. He appealed to the youth to stay at home. He also informed Lagosians that they were no casualties that had been recorded in the hospitals in the vicinity of the Lekki based on information from monitoring the incident.\n\n\u201cShortly after this we got reports that one of the patients in Reddington hospital had passed on and died from blunt force trauma and another report came of another death from Yaba.\u201d\n\nOn the actual number of alleged deaths at the Lekki Toll incident, since the 20th October 2020, the witness noted that many of the people reported to have been killed refuted their rumoured deaths.\n\nHe listed Nollywood actress, Eniola Badmus, Stephen Becky, Iraby of Oto-Auch, Joshua Ogbodo as some person who was said to have been killed during the Lekki shooting but who have since come out to deny same.\n\nOthers are \u201cAnthony Chechukwu alleged to have been shot by soldiers at the Lekki tollgate has been confirmed to have died in a motorcycle accident and Lucia Adu who was claimed to have died at the Lekki Toll Gate was confirmed to have been killed in an accident involving a stationary truck on 20th October 2020.\u201d\n\nUnder cross-examination, by Mr Adesina Ogunlana, counsel to some of the #EndSARS protesters, Mr Muri-Okunola reaffirmed that he heard that military men from Bonny camp were at the Lekki toll gate and based on video evidence they were armed and \u201cshots were fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt about 6.45pm, on Oct 20, we received feedback via a phone call from a resident in Ikoyi of gunshots in the area, we thought it was a robbery until there was subsequent calls reporting same from the other side of the River, the Ozumba Mbadiwe side and that person confirmed it was from the toll gate plaza,\u201d Muri-Okunola said.\n\nHe added that based on this and subsequent information, Mr Governor called the MD of the Lekki Concession Company (LLC) to ask if there was gunshots at the toll plaza.\n\n\u201cOn social media, based on supposed live broadcasts and comments, they said it was armed soldiers so this led the Governor to call General Ndagi who was the representative of the Army on the Security Council meeting. He informed the governor that it was not his men at the toll gate as they also had been instructed to stand down. At that particular point in time, our concerns were that if the shooting was going on, we needed to deploy emergency services and that was our focus.\n\n\u201cWe also directed the Commissioner of Health to start speaking to hospitals if there were casualties in the neighbourhood of the Lekki toll gate.\n\n\u201cWe were informed that there were casualties at some of our hospitals in Lagos. There were more in the Reddington Lekki and the General Hospital, Marina. We got information from other parts of Lagos where there was also violence,\u201d the HoS explained.\n\nEarlier in the testimony, counsel representing some #EndSARS protesters, Adeshina Ogunlana had argued that the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu should have personally come before the panel to testify.\n\nThe chairman of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi had however held that the governor is not \u201ccompellable\u201d because he has been conferred immunity Under Section 308 of the constitution.\n\nMr Muri-Okunola\u2019s testimony is coming against the background of a summons sent to him by the panel over the Lekki incident of October 20, 2020.",

A further six charges were subsequently added.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to five counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and 11 counts of possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.\n\nNugent pleaded not guilty to two counts of encouraging terrorism. The judge however ruled that even though there was sufficient evidence for a prosecution there was no public interest in proceeding on those charges.",
