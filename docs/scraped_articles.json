          "text": "Former Rep Jibrin says ex-Lagos governor is best option for Nigeria\n\nSupport Group inaugurates steering committee in Ondo\n\nMore than 2,500 Islamic clerics in Kano State yesterday held a special prayer session for the success of the perceived presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nThe prayer session, which was at the instance of the Managing Director, Federal Housing Authority, Abdullmumini Jibrin Kofa, took place in his village, Kofa, in Bebeji Local Government area of the state.\n\nThe clerics were led by the Chief Imam of Kafin-Maiyaki, who recited verses from the Holy Qur\u2019an.\n\nJibrin, a former member of the House of Representatives for Bebeji/Kiru Constituency, said the prayer was \u201corganised for the success of the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the forthcoming general elections as well as for peace and stability in the country.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said: \u201cI can confirm to you that Tinubu will contest the 2023 elections. The aspect of the decision is done; it\u2019s a done deal.\n\n\u201cArrangements to publicly declare will soon be known. I\u2019m talking to you officially that he (Tinubu) will contest the presidential seat.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody who can carry along everybody and I believe that Tinubu is the best option for Nigeria. He is not a religious fanatic and has massive networks across all the boundaries in the country.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju has worked extensively for the APC and never shifted ground. He is competent to be the president of this country.\n\n\u201cNigerians always go for quality and I believe that issue is purely on the quality of the person\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a dark horse coming in 2023. It will take super miracle in APC and God willing, Tinubu will emerge as president.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju has an edge ahead of others. He will not lose the ticket and will be the president of this great country under the APC.\u201d\n\nAlso at the occasion, Jibrin gave start- up capital to 2,500 youths who have been trained in various skills while scholarship grants were given to over 2,500 girls from the 44 local government areas of the state.\n\nEach of the beneficiaries received financial support ranging from N100,000 downwards, Kofa said.\n\nTinubu Support Group inaugurates steering committee in Ondo\n\nThe Tinubu Support Group (TSG) has also inaugurated its steering committee in the six local government areas of Ondo North Senatorial District to boost support for the presidential bid of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration, the National Coordinator of Asiwaju Change Movement, Hon. Simisola Ayoade, said the committee would work out modalities and strategise towards actualising the ambition of the former Lagos State governor.\n\nAyoade said the group was still pressurising Tinubu to join the presidential race.\n\nShe described Tinubu as a \u201cman who is ready to sacrifice all he has for his fatherland. A man who has comfortable control of the entire Southwest and six solid governors, yet threw everything for an alliance with President Buhari for the love of the great people of Nigeria to midwife the birth of a new pan Nigerian political party of our dreams.\n\n\u201cA man who ran a state that gives opportunities to citizens for appointive and elective positions on merit without regard to their religion, ethnicity, or clan. This is a man who left office in 2007 yet is popular to date. Because he is focused, consistent, and has been the central figure of Nigerian politics since our return to democracy in 1999.\u201d\n\nA chieftain of the Ondo APC, Barr. R. O Kazeem, said Tinubu has obliquely indicated his interest hence the need to support him ahead of the 2023 election became imperative.\n\n\u201cHe has worked and built many bigwigs in the political space. No other person showed interest, only him, and we are going to support him to clinch the ticket,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "2022 prophecy: Tough time awaits Kanu, Igboho",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nPrimate Babatunde Elijah Ayodele of Inri Evangelical Spiritual Church, Lagos, has issued fresh divine insights on how Nigeria can survival 2022, a year he described as a mixed bag, even as he released fresh predictions for the year.\n\nThe popular seer in an exclusive interview with Sunday Sun urged Nigerians to be watchful and prayerful in the New Year in order to avert looming troubles ahead just as he announced that the first seven days of the year have been set aside for prayers for the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first 160 days in 2022 Nigerians must be very careful and prayerful because of the evil of that period that is why we have set aside the first seven days of the year for prayers to avert the looming dangers ahead. The year 2022 is a year of mixed bag. So as a country we need prayers in order to avert avoidable troubles\u201d.\n\nPrimate Ayodele said that contrary to insinuations, the Federal Government has no agenda to kill Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu, who are currently in detentions, but revealed that the duo might not find it easy as they battle to regain their freedom.\n\nHis words: \u201cSunday Igboho must calm down. In fact, he needs to change his lawyer. He should look for a new and senior \u201cSalami\u201d to handle his case. In addition to that, if Igboho does not handle his matter very well he will stay longer in detention. The Nigerian government is so much interested in him. They are not going to kill him, but they are keen on holding him until the end of this administration. So, he must be very prayerful.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu will not find it so easy as well. He should still expect tough time because the government is not ready to free him for one second. He needs to be very prayerful and watchful this time around. The government does not have any plans to kill either Igboho or Kanu. They should put that insinuation aside. Government will employ all sorts of tactics to prolong their days in detention. This year will be a tougher year for IPOB and ESN. There will be confrontations and killing between the nation\u2019s security forces and IPOB and ESN.\u201d\n\nOn the nation\u2019s economy, Primate Ayodele said: \u201cNigerians need to be watchful about the nation\u2019s economy. Our economy is going down. Oil will be discovered in few other places, but it will not impact on the economy. Some documents will leak from NNPC and that will put the corporation into troubles. This will create problem for the Minister of Petroleum and the GMD of NNPC.\n\n\u201cThe planned removal of fuel subsidy will plunge Nigeria into deeper problem. In addition to the hike in price of PMS, Nigerians must also expect scarcity of the product this year. I am seeing protest which can grind Buhari\u2019s government for some time.\u201d\n\nHis revelations for the New Year also captures the nation\u2019s politics and the political actors in the country.\n\n\u201cI will like to warn Hope Uzodimma not to waste his time and resources on re-election because he will definitely lose. PDP will take over the state at the end of next election. APC will not win Cross Rivers although the incumbent governor, Ben Ayade belongs to APC. And if the man aspires to run for presidency or Vice President, his dream will not see the light of the day.\n\n\u201cTinubu will face a lot of trials and complications. He should drop his presidential ambition for better things because God has not ordained him. If anybody puts him there they will just mess this country up.\n\n\u201cAtiku will not make a better option as the president of Nigeria. If PDP gives it to Atiku, the party should bid the 2023 presidency goodbye.\n\n\u201cKwankwaso wants to decamp; if he decamps to APC, he will just mess himself up,\u201d he revealed.\n\nConcerning the 2023 elections, the man of God said: \u201cThese are the people God revealed to me as presidential and vice presidential materials if they are lucky to be picked.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn APC, we have people like Zulum, Mala Buni, governor of Yobe; Boss Mustapha, Malami, Fashola, Aregbesola, Fayemi and Akpabio. The endorsement of Osinbajo by Babangida is a waste of time. Osinbajo would have been a good choice, but the northerners do not want him. These are the people Buhari should support. Buhari will not support Tinubu. The rotational president Nigerians are clamouring for is not too certain. In fact, power may return to the North if care is not taken.\n\n\u201cIn PDP, talking of presidential and vice presidential candidates, I can see Tambuwal, Saraki, Bala, Wike, Okowa, Makinde, Udom, Ortom and Enugu State governor. Things can change tomorrow, but at the moment this is the list of people God revealed to me. I am still praying to God who among them is going to be the president. I will reveal the person immediately God shows me the person.\n\n\u201cOgun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, is going to make a lot of mistakes. Amosun will still tackle him. If care is not taken Amosun boys will come back. If Amosun can retrace his steps and find a way to bring back his boys, including the disgruntled ones, Amosun boys will take over from Dapo Abiodun in 2023. Abiodun will face so many problems. Abiodun\u2019s efforts will not be appreciated because he has stepped on so many toes. He must strive hard to prevent people decamping from his party and restrain himself from committing more blunders.\n\n\u201cIf Ekweremadu can work very hard, because they want to gang up against his governorship ambition in Enugu State, PDP will still win, PDP will win Imo State, PDP will win Cross River. PDP will still win Abia State.\n\n\u201cSome people will still decamp to PDP after the APC convention, APC will be shaken. The best chairmanship candidate that can help APC is Suswam.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Bill will not be allowed to fly as expected. The Senate and House of Representatives will still have to be watchful and prayerful. I am seeing a new building for the Senate.\n\n\u201cI see confusion in Aso Rock. Sensitive documents that will expose Buhari\u2019s government will leak. Some Buhari\u2019s cabinet members will be accused of corruption. EFCC will go after some people that have political ambitions and kill their ambitions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on insecurity and crisis in the country, the Lagos-based cleric said: \u201cNigerians must pray very well so that our military facilities and other sensitive places will not be attacked. Boko Haram will strike harder between February and July. In particularly, we must be prayerful and watchful in the months of February and March because of the evil plans of these enemies of the state. They should be watchful in Lagos, Abuja, Rivers. Maiduguri, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Zamfara and Gombe.\n\n\u201cThe crisis in the Southern Kaduna will rear its ugly head again in 2022 and this will spoil the chances of APC in Kaduna. El-Rufai and Ganduje should not dream to be president likewise I can\u2019t see Yahyah Bello as president of this country.\n\n\u201cThere will be more confusion. Let pray so our security operatives fighting insecurity will not go on strike. Nigeria cannot defeat these terrorists without engaging mercenaries. There will be an attempt by these terrorists to launch missile attacks against fighter jets. So let us pray not to see a plane that will crash at Murtala Airport or a plane overshooting the runway. We should also pray against NAF plane crashing. We must pray so that our military fighting Boko Haram will not be ambushed. Let us pray so that pirates will not attack our Navy on the high sea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pray against the attack on a governor\u2019s convoy, the CBN governor falling sick. Let\u2019s pray for a Commissioner in Ogun State and in Kaduna, Sokoto and in Plateau.\n\n\u201cSome banks are going to have issues. CBN is going to contend with a lot of troubles. Some banks are going to face CBN challenges. These include First Bank, Access Bank, Unity Bank, Stanbic, Eco Bank and GTB.\u201d\n\nThe man of God urged Nigerians not to disregard the COVID-19 protocols put in place by health authorities in the country, saying, \u201cNigerians must take the issue of Coronavirus seriously. The world will still have to contend with the virus throughout the New Year by having to observe the protocols that are in place.\u201d",

But this tension will reduce after the two parties pick their candidates. The Lord did not abandon this nation and there will be a strong statement from heaven to prove it. God in his wisdom will reunite this nation through a southerner who has what it takes to reunite the country and provide a peaceful atmosphere for all man and businesses.\n\n\u201cSome people complain about Buhari\u2019s presidency because they are spiritually blind to see what would have happened if Buhari was not the president. Buhari became president at a time the nation needed him and God approved it. I have seen Orji Uzor Kalu of the Southeast and Nyesom Wike of the South-south in the final election.\n\n\u201cHow it would happen is what I don\u2019t know, but these two will be the presidential candidates of the APC and PDP. Our duty is to pray for the anointed not to turn his back on God when he becomes the president; 2022 is coming with a lot of challenges, but we will continue to pray for you. A lot have been revealed to me and I want you to be strong and never entertain fear. God would always provide for His people.\u201d\n\nProphet Arogun came to limelight when in the New Year of 2014, he narrated how President Goodluck Jonathan would lose the 2015 election to Buhari.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said that Buhari\u2019s victory would be welcomed by Nigerians and international community because God had anointed Buhari to lead the country.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Prophet Arogun also prophesied about the 2023 presidency and President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nSpeaking during his new month ministration service, he said that Buhari\u2019s successor is a former governor from the Southeast who was in prison. He said that God put him in prison to preserve his life, adding that he would be released after six months.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am a prophet of God and by the grace of God, anything the Lord tells us comes to pass because we hear from Him; we don\u2019t hear from men.\n\nWe don\u2019t rely on public opinion for prophecies. We are not afraid of what people will say when such prophecies are given to us to tell the people. When we hear from the Lord, we tell people no matter how it is interpreted. It is left for people to take it.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2015 election, God told me that Buhari would win; And God told me a lot of things about Buhari. It is He that anointed him to be the president and there is no questions about that. No one can change it. The people can hate him: the people can reject him, but God has ordained him, and there is something about God. When He says that you would be this, no man can change it. He does what pleases Him.\n\n\u201cI got a revelation about Nigeria\u2019s political dynamics in the next general election. I saw a man in prison and this man has been a former governor from the Southeast taking over from President Buhari. There is absolutely nothing one can do about someone\u2019s destiny especially when sanctioned by God. Everything that happens in life is for a reason. I saw renewed alliances among the political class and across the political parties and I saw this country reuniting more than it has ever done before. God loves Nigeria so much. Nigeria is a big country, and is blessed with human and natural resources.\u201d",

It is going to be a costly venture for them because during election, it is like a draft game. You anticipate the opponent to see the seed he wants to play next. That seed of PDP of going North will backfire. They better align with APC and if APC comes South, let them also come South. So, it becomes an all-South affair. But if they go North, I can tell them that as it is today, they will lose the presidential election, no matter the candidate they bring from the North. The Southeasterners will feel that they have been used and dumped. The Southeast, South-south will feel that they have been used and dumped. The Southwest too will feel it is the turn of South as the Southern governors agreed and in the North-central, the minority sympathy in the Middle Belt will come in.\u201d\n\nNgige stated this while fielding questions from journalists at his country home in Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra State, on the eve of the New Year.\n\n\u201cSo, we expect that our national chairman this time around will come from the North and our presidential candidate will come from the South and it is left for the Southerners to decide the zone it will go among Southeast, South-south and Southwest, but for equity and moral ground, the Southeast should be as it is the only one yet to produce the president since 1999,\u201d he said\n\nHe said that his strong support for the emergence of a president of Southern extraction was in line with the rotation and zoning convention guiding the composition of government at various levels in the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "*Say internal rivalries in APC normal\n\n*Optimistic president will tackle insecurity\n\n*El-Rufai denies alleged pact to contest with Fayemi\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and his Kaduna State counterpart, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai have defended the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to reject the direct primary clause in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2021.\n\nAlso, the governors have rejected the public perception that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is fractured amid internal rivalries among the different power blocs ahead of its national convention in February 2022 and 2023 general elections.\n\nThey made these clarifications yesterday in separate interviews on ARISE NEWS Channel.\n\nThe two APC governors backed Buhari\u2019s rejection of the bill against the position of the National Assembly.\n\nBefore Buhari declined assent to the bill, the federal lawmakers and the governors had lobbied the presidency over the bill.\n\nWhile the lawmakers were in support of the direct primary, the governors were opposed to the clause in the bill.\n\nFayemi and el-Rufai argued that Buhari was an advocate of direct primary, through which he emerged as the presidential candidate of the APC in 2018.\n\nSpecifically, el-Rufai explained that the president \u201chas always been an advocate of direct primary from our days in the Congress for Progressives Change through to our last primary in 2018 when he ran for the second term.\n\n\u201cIdeologically and personally, Buhari prefers direct primary to indirect primary because he believes direct primary is the one that gives party members greater participation in deciding who is their candidate rather than a few elected delegates that can be susceptible to corruption,\u201d the Kaduna State governor explained.\n\nHe listed four conditions that could make a direct primary model effective across all states of the federation, pointing out that no state had been able to meet all the conditions for the seamless conduct of primaries.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor first cited the need for all political parties to have a credible membership register, which according to him, every stakeholder of a political party agreed that it \u201cis the real membership register of the party.\u201d\n\nHe also explained the need for every party member \u201cto have a biometric card with a barcode so that it can be easily identified before he can vote in the primary. We need to produce cards similar to the permanent voters\u2019 cards of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\u201d\n\nHe equally highlighted a mechanism for counting votes in the direct primary as part of the four conditions for adopting the model, noting that every party member and stakeholder \u201cmust have confidence in such a system of vote-counting.\u201d\n\nThe governor listed the imperatives of security in the conduct of direct primaries across the federation, placing emphasis on the need to prevent non-party members from coming into the venue to vote or prevent thugs from being imported to disrupt the voting process.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we do not have these conditions, direct primary will be a disaster. We can adopt a direct primary mode if we have the infrastructure in place. But how many states in Nigeria have the infrastructure? Kaduna is the state in the federation that has the infrastructure to conduct direct primaries.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the level of preparedness of the political parties for the direct primary \u201cis probably questionable. As I said earlier, Kaduna is perhaps the only state that had one element of the four conditions that I pointed out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason some politicians are calling for a direct primary is that they think they can do what happened in Lagos, Anambra or so and write the result. It is not because they think the direct primary is quite possible,\u201d he said\n\nHe urged Nigerians \u201cto be very discerning, careful and understand the process of direct primary and the conditioned precedents as against the indirect primary and not make our moral judgment without understanding the dynamics of it.\n\n\u201cHere, in Kaduna State, we are neutral. We do direct primary. We can do indirect primary. We don\u2019t have problems in our party. We have a united party. We also have some elements that enable us to do direct primary. I am not sure others have it.\n\n\u201cThis is the part of the reasons President Buhari held on the side of caution that we should allow the parties to choose. But I know in his heart that President Buhari will prefer a direct primary. But he is not going to be contesting. He has no interest in the next election.\n\n\u201cHe is in the position to be objective about this legislation. That is what he did. I think Nigerians should commend him for going against what he prefers in the interest of the country,\u201d el-Rufai added.\n\nSpeaking further on the APC crisis, the Kaduna State governor pointed out that the ruling party, like any political party, \u201cis an amalgam of the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\nHe, also, pointed out that there \u201care people, who do not share the vision and outlook of President Buhari. There are some that are in this for what they can get. There are some that are in this for public service.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of every political party to manage these tendencies, suppress the base instincts and elevate the better instincts. We are going to that. The president was unhappy because we lost seven states we could have won under Adams Oshiomhole.\n\n\u201cThis is because of all kinds of problems in the management of the party. \u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is trying to sort these problems and unite the party. They have made some progress. They have brought some governors back to our party.\n\n\u201cThey have also engaged in intensive reconciliation. The Abdullahi Adamu Committee is working on reconciliation after the congresses. We have 36 states. After the congresses, we have intra-party crises in five states.\n\n\u201cThat is not significant. There are problems in Kano. There are problems in Kebbi. There are problems in Yobe? I have not heard of problems in Yobe. But there are problems in Zamfara. Really, I think we will sort out problems.\u201d\n\nDebunking the allegation that he would seek a joint presidential ticket with Fayemi, el-Rufai said he would not contest the 2023 presidential election on the ground that there was an understanding among the stakeholders that the presidency should be open to the south.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not ruling myself out because of that. I am saying that it is an understanding. I am a member of APC. Unless circumstances compel the APC of the South to come to us in the North and say we do not want it, then I can say it is now open for northerners.\n\n\u201cUntil then, I think there is a moral problem in trying to ignore what is clearly an understanding. This kind of agreement is the currency of politics. So, it is not about ruling myself out or whatever. I have never offered myself for that office. But I have been suspected of it since 2007.\u201d\n\nHe denied any plan to seek a joint ticket with Fayemi, noting that there \u201cis nothing like that. It is mere speculation. There are many speculations like that in the public. I want to assure you that it is nothing.\n\n\u201cFor me, Nigeria is at a critical juncture and we have many problems. I think Nigerians should look very closely and choose leaders that will address those problems no matter where they come from,\u201d el-Rufai explained.\n\nOn his part, Fayemi also argued that the president was an advocate of direct primary, pointing out that he had been a product of direct and indirect primary modes.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI have the honour of being the Chairman of the National Convention that produced Buhari as the candidate of our party in December 2014. Then, it was an indirect primary. It was a delegate primary. But in 2018 when he was seeking re-election, he emerged via a direct primary.\u201d\n\nOn this ground, he contended that Buhari \u201cis not an opponent of direct primary, neither is he the promoter of indirect primary. He outlined what he thought should be the approach, which as currently exists, resides with the political parties whether it is direct, indirect or consensus.\u201d\n\nFayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), warned against an assumption that direct primary \u201cis a cure or solution to whatever maleficence we feel exists about our democratisation process. Direct primary is obviously more inclusive. It is theoretically more inclusive.\n\n\u201cWhat we have also seen in Nigeria in the last two years of what we call direct primary does not suggest a cure. Look at the figures. We just had an election in Anambra State. We saw what happened there at my own party. We could not even muster the number our candidate had in the direct primary during the governorship election. We could not muster a quarter of it in the real election.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary so-called was the direct primary of its own members and not entire voters in the state. In the real election, however, we ended with a little above 40,000. Clearly, there is a mismatch that we need to address,\u201d he said.\n\nFayemi assured Nigerians that the president would sign the electoral bill if the National Assembly addressed the area of concern and transmitted it to the presidency before it was too late while faulting claims that Buhari and governors were not comfortable with the electronic transmission of election result clause.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you read his letter to the National Assembly, President Muhammadu only spoke about direct primary clause, meaning that if the clause is removed, I would not see any problem with the president signing a revised bill if transmitted on time.\n\n\u201cThe president has the mind of his own. Governors may have their views just as the members of the National Assembly have their views. I think what is important is president Buhari\u2019s commitment to the democratisation process.\n\n\u201cIf the National Assembly does the right thing by addressing the issue the president has raised in his response, I believe he will sign it. But they should do it quickly so that there is no time lag,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking on internal rivalries in the APC, Fayemi said any thriving living organisation would ordinarily undergo contention, claiming that there \u201cis nothing wrong in people having contention.\n\n\u201cIf you see a political party without tendencies, it is a dead organisation. I do not see any problem with people holding views that are contrary to the mainstream view in the party or that represent a body of opinion about how they feel,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, there are a lot of such views in the APC.\n\n\u201cWe applaud that. We cherish that. There should not be a problem with that as long as the big picture is not affected\u201d.\n\nBoth governor expressed optimism that the insecurity plaguing the country would soon be tackled.\n\nFor instance, expressing concern about issue, el-Rufai said it was becoming increasingly political, citing statements and utterances of some political leaders.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cone of the candidates for the 2019 elections said if Buhari was re-elected, banditry would get worse. Is that a prophecy? How did the candidate know what he was talking about? Is this rise in banditry fuelled by political consideration?\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said banditry \u201cis a tipping point and it has to be crushed. We are going to see the end of it this year because we are not going into election with this level of insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a former general and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, we all know Buhari, his antecedents and how he invaded Chad when germdemes entered Borno State.\n\n\u201cAre some politicians fuelling this to discredit the president? Is this about 2023? Is it to say that APC failed to provide security so that it can be a campaign issue in 2023?\n\n\u201cI do not know. But there are many of us that analyse the utterances and statements of some political leaders around that time that we did not take quite seriously.\n\nFor Fayemi, the security challenges confronting Nigeria can be fixed within 17 months.\n\nAccording to the second-term governor, insecurity is affecting the rating of the regime of the president.\n\nFayemi also noted that security chiefs in the country know what to do to end banditry and other security challenges in the country.\n\nHe explained that not ending the security challenges within 17 months may mean that some people are benefitting from the \u201cwar economy.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we can destroy that monster of insecurity, the opinion in the country will change dramatically.

          "text": "*May prevail on Atiku to accept BoT chairmanship\n\n*APC agreed after merger to rotate presidency, says Ngige\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nSome governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have embarked on fresh move to zone the presidential ticket of the party in the 2023 general election to the South, in line with the position of the 17 southern governors that power should shift to the South in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAlso, in a first major endorsement for power shift by a member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has expressed support for the emergence of a president from the southern part of the country, insisting that the All Progressives Congress (APC) agreed after merger to rotate presidency between North and the South.\n\nThis development is coming as the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu has enjoined Nigerians not to be hopeful of any meaningful change from the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration in 2022, saying the ruling party is bent on bringing more hardship to Nigerians.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that as part of the strategic consultations to realise this aspiration, some PDP governors had met with one of their colleagues in the North-east to help mount pressure on former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to accept the position of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the party.\n\nA source close to the governors and who is also privy to the new permutations in the main opposition party told THISDAY off-record that the incumbent chairman of the PDP BoT, Senator Walid Jubrin would be rounding off his tenure before the 2023 general election.\n\nThe PDP had zoned its national chairmanship ticket to the North, raising hopes that the presidential candidate would emerge from thesouthern part of the country.\n\nBut the body language of Atiku and some other chieftains of the party from the North has revealed that they are nursing the ambition to contest the position.\n\nHowever, the source told THISDAY that the PDP governors were working to prevail on Atiku to drop his ambition and allow power to shift to the South for the sake of justice and fairness.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Atiku is eminently qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election, the source added that the clamour for power shift and the issue of age could work against the former vice president.\n\n\u201cAtiku will be almost 77 years by 2023 as he is currently 75 years and that Nigerians may not accept such an old presidential candidate in view of the present circumstances of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cPDP gave Atiku the ticket in 2019 and may not be in a position to take the same gamble again.\n\n\u201cThe governors are thinking of allowing the former vice president to settle for the office of the chairman of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT),\u201d he explained.\n\nWith the popular agitation for power shift, the source further explained that the two leading political parties \u2013 PDP and APC may ensure the repeat of what happened in 1999 where the PDP and the then All Peoples Party (APP) produced two presidential candidates -Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and Chief Olu Falae from the South, to pacify the South-west over the annulment of the 1993 presidential election won by the late Chief MKO Abiola.\n\nAccording to the source, a repeat of the 1999 configuration would promote equity and fairness as well as address the agitation against marginalisation.\n\nHe noted that if power shifts to the South, the odds would favour the South-east geopolitical zone.\n\nHe explained that the PDP stakeholders were buying into the sentiments of ensuring equity and fairness to push for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the South.\n\nAccording to him, it is feared that if the PDP goes ahead to produce a presidential candidate outside of the southern states and the APC eventually ensures that it picks its presidential candidate from the south, the main opposition party will lose sympathy as many Nigerians will support APC to ensure the emergence of a president of southern extraction by 2023.\n\n\u201cIn whatever that we are doing, the continued unity of Nigeria should be taken into consideration. We are all aware of what happened in 1999 when the issue of June 12 threatened the nation.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is more than the June 12 agitation because of the nepotism of the present administration. There must be a Nigeria before we talk of the 2023 general election. There must be unity before everything and everybody must reason on how best to assuage the heightened tension in the country. It will not be business as usual. We must make compromises,\u201d the source further explained.\n\nAPC Agreed after Merger to Rotate Presidency, Says Ngige\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Ngige, has expressed support for the emergence of a president from the southern part of the country in 2023.\n\nNgige who is a chieftain of the ruling APC, disclosed that the APC agreed after merger to rotate the presidency, stressing that that zoning and rotation of power create stability, unity, equity and progress of the country.\n\nAccording to him, rotation engenders confidence and patriotism and ensures that no one ethnic group or section of the country dominates the other.\n\nThe former Anambra State governor faulted those saying that no such convention exists.\n\nHe particularly berated the opposition PDP for waiting for APC to choose a southern presidential candidate, so that it can pick its candidate from the North in clear breach of the rotation convention and even against the rotation principle enshrined in the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cTheir top apparatchik thinks they are smart. They want to play a fast one. They are waiting for APC to go to South. Their calculation is that when that happens, they will go to the North. Number one, that will be an act in bad faith because it will mean that they have taken the people in the South-south and South-east that have all along supported PDP 90 per cent in all the elections, for a ride.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will be shocked the way the South-east, the South-south and other minorities, and in fact, Nigerians as a whole will revolt. I was a founding member of the PDP. I was in its National Executive Committee as the Assistant National Secretary, South-east and served in many strategic standing committees. I was elected governor on the platform of the PDP. I know that the constitution of the PDP is clear on rotation of power and zoning of offices between the North and South.\n\n\u201cSo, if they are waiting for our great party the APC to choose a southern candidate so they can quickly turn and present a northern candidate at a point the dominant mood in the country is for power to shift to the South, then, they are deceiving themselves. Nigerians will shock them.\u201d\n\nA statement by the minister\u2019s media office in Abuja quoted Ngige as having made the assertions while answering questions from journalists at his country home in Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra State.\n\nNgige insisted that an unwritten agreement exists among politicians and political parties that rotation of offices should take place, adding that it was written down as a constitutional provision in the case of PDP.\n\nNgige noted that the issue of the rotation of the prime offices in the land is not expressly written in the constitution of APC, but insisted that the ruling party had agreed to rotate presidency after its merger.\n\n\u201cI was the secretary at our first convention and I took all the minutes. We had an agreement that our flag-bearer would come from the North and after North, it would go down to the South. So, those who are talking today were not there when this agreement was made. But was it written down and signed by politicians from both sides? No. But we had minutes of the meeting. They are there. It was agreed that there would be a movement between North and South.\n\n\u201cAs we were doing the convention and filling in offices, we narrowed down our candidates to about two or three. But, among the candidates, General Buhari was topping. All of us from the ACN caucus had agreed that he was our candidate. CPC had agreed that he would be their candidate. ANPP was split into two. So, when we went to the presidential convention, he emerged with a wide margin. That is the truth of the matter,\u201d Ngige explained.\n\nHe also argued that power rotation is contained in the 1999 constitution of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst, Section 14 (3) of the constitution is clear on the composition of government at the national, states and even local government level, in such a way that there should be no actual or perceptions of domination by any single tribe or group of persons from one ethnic nationality so as to engender confidence and patriotism,\u201d he added.\n\nAPC Maladministration will Bring Sufferings to Nigerians, says Ayu\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the PDP, Ayu has alleged that the ruling APC is bent on making lives nasty, brutish and short for Nigerians in 2022.\n\nAyu, who stated this in a New Year message to Nigerians, however, promised that the reign of the APC was about to give way to a creditable government that would work in the interest of all.\n\nHe said: \u201cDo not expect anything better from the APC in 2022? They will still make your life nasty, brutish and short.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that all bad things come to an end. The hell that is APC will surely come to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nAyu stressed that to oust the ruling party, Nigerians of eligible age should register and vote in the 2023 general election to herald a new dawn.\n\n\u201cGo out and register. Get your voters\u2019 cards, mobilise and get this evil out of your lives. This is why 2022 is such an important year of hope for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the PDP, I wish you a hopeful New Year, a year that we all begin the journey for the liberation and rebuilding of Nigeria. So, help us God,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Claims $9.5bn spent on refineries\u2019 TAM since 2012\n\n*Insists on mass protests on January 27\n\n*Orders strike in seven states over non-payment of minimum wage\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has raised the alarm over what it described as an international conspiracy, working with local collaborators to keep the Nigerian economy and people perpetually on their knees through the under-development of the country\u2019s downstream petroleum sector.\n\nThe labour union has also claimed that about $9.5 billion had been spent on the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), and Greenfield refineryprojects since 2012 without government being able to resolve the crisis of mass importation of refined petroleum products into Nigeria.\n\nIt also said that in line with the directives of its National Executive Council (NEC), the councils in seven states \u2013 Zamfara, Abia, Imo, Cross River, Kogi, Benue and Taraba have been asked to commence industrial actions against their state governments for failure to implement the new national minimum wage and pension.\n\nIn a message issued by the NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, to mark the New Year, the union said that it suspected foul play and sabotage in the inability and unwillingness of successive governments in the country to resolve the crisis of the under-development of Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector.\n\nIt regretted that successive governments in Nigeria had failed to take strategic advantage of the country\u2019s natural endowment in oil and gas especially her prime position as the highest producer of crude oil in Africa to expand the economy, induce economic growth and engender sustainable national development.\n\nThe union regretted that as a major oil-producing country in the world and after nearly 70 years of oil exploration in Nigeria, the country cannot deliver on efficient and effective public petroleum refineries.\n\n\u201cToday, instead of referring to crude oil as the blessing that it is, we now commonly describe this gift of God to Nigeria as \u201cResource Curse,\u201d the union said.\n\nPointing at the efforts being made by the country\u2019s foremost industrialist, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, in building a refinery, NLC said the inability of the federal government to invest in the rehabilitation of the four public refineries and building of new refineries amounted to short-sightedness.\n\nReacting to the federal government\u2019s alleged plan to increase the price of petrol, NLC said that it would go ahead with the nationwide protest scheduled for January 27.\n\n\u201cGiven the direct relationship between the outrageous amount said to have been invested in the payment of the so-called petroleum subsidy and the pressure to get foreign loans from Bretton Wood Institutions to meet perennial shortfall in revenue, we believe that the crisis of the under-development of Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector, the comatose of our four public refineries and the inability of successive government to right this economic sabotage smacks of an international conspiracy at the behest of local collaborators to keep the Nigerian economy and people perpetually on their knees,\u201d it said.\n\nNLC said the January 27 protest in the states would culminate in the submission of protest letters to the 36 state governors and subsequently, on February 1, 2022, there would be a national protest to be held in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerian workers and people to dust their sneakers and fully participate in the peaceful protests and rallies aimed at salvaging our economic future,\u201d it said.\n\nThe union argued that the suggestion by the government that the remedy to the downstream petroleum sector is to stop further payment of the so-called petrol subsidy is akin to cutting one\u2019s nose in order to spite one\u2019s face\n\nIt described the idea of paying transport allowances \u201cas robbing ourselves to pay ourselves as the amount being bandied for such transport subsidy clearly outstrips the amount that is currently expended on the so-called petrol subsidy\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat the government is proposing is to abandon the Nigerian workers and people to very cruel market forces whose sole drive is profit maximisation. This is why we believe that private investment in building petroleum refineries is not enough. Government must ensure that public refineries also work.\n\n\u201cThis way, there would be true competition and Nigerians would be able to derive the most benefit from a resource that God freely and amply made available to the Nigerian nation,\u201d it said.\n\nNLC further expressed concern that the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sector was being aggravated by the persisting crisis in the upstream sub-sector.\n\nAccording to the labour body, it was recently reported that almost 200 million barrels of crude oil were lost in 2021, as a result of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, poor long term investment outlay, poor security of inland waterways, and challenges arising from conflicts with oil bearing communities and host communities of oil facilities.\n\nAlso reacting to the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, NLC said the law still did not sufficiently address the deficits of governance, oversight, investment, environmental integrity, local beneficiation and the use of petroleum resources to advance the cause of the ordinary Nigerian worker and citizen.\n\nIt urged the two chambers of the National Assembly to immediately commence the process of reviewing the Petroleum Industry Act to reflect the aspirations of Nigerian workers and people.\n\nIn addition, NLC lamented that since the national minimum wage was signed into law by President Buhari in April 2019, the implementation has been a tale of mixed fortunes across the 36 states of the federation and the FCT.\n\nAccording to NLC, while some states are in compliance, others are not. \u201cWhile most of the states in the North-west geopolitical zone have started implementing the new national minimum wage, there is an exception in the case of Zamfara State, which has refused to pay the national minimum wage and consequential salary adjustment to workers in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the North-east, the exception is Taraba State, which is yet to fully implement the new national minimum wage. In the North-central, there are still challenges of full implementation in Benue and Kogistates.\n\n\u201cIn the South-west, most of the states are already in compliance. In the South-south, the weak link is Cross River State, which has spurned all agreements and entreaties to pay workers in the state the new national minimum wage and consequential salary adjustment.\n\n\u201cIn the South-east, NLC said that Imo and Abia state governments have remained the thorns in the flesh of workers.\n\n\u201cApart from refusing to fully implement the national minimum wage and consequential salary increase, the state governments have also been promoting clandestine and rogue labour leaders unknown to the labour movement,\u201d the union alleged.\n\nIn line with the directives of the NEC meeting, NLC said that it has asked the affected state councils to commence industrial actions against their state governments.\n\nThe union also described as very disturbing, the penchant by some state governors to owe pensioners arrears of pension and gratuities.\n\n\u201cWe commend the Federal Government for clearing most of the accrued benefits of our pensioners. Kudos should also go to some state governors who have shown serious commitment to the payment of pensions, gratuity and other accrued benefits to their retirees.\n\n\u201cIn the North-west, the Kebbi and Jigawa states\u2019 governments have been very responsive to the welfare of pensioners. While the Jigawa State government has institutionalised a responsive pension administrative system, the Kebbi State government recently released funds to defray pensions and gratuity arrears in the state. \u201cIn the North-east, the Governor of Borno State recently cleared about N12 billion arrears of pension and gratuity indebtedness. In the North-central, the governors of Kwara, Niger and Plateau states have been very proactive in settling accrued pension benefits in their states.\n\n\u201cIn the South-west, the Lagos State government has continued to blaze the trail in paying its pension and retirement obligations. The Oyo State government has also been consistent in redeeming its pension liabilities. In the South-east, the Anambra State government has paid its pension obligations up to November 2021. In the South-south, the Cross Rivers State government is defaulting in paying gratuities,\u201d the union explained. While assessing the preceding year, NLC said that one of the worst vicissitudes of 2021 was the escalation of insecurity across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\nIt said that Nigerians were harassed like no other year in 2021. NLC made reference to the recent alarm raised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the increasing siege of insecurity all over the country, and the fact that it poses a serious threat to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThere are already palpable fears of intense hunger in 2022, owing to the inability of many farmers to go to the farm. Even those who managed to go to the farm in many northern states were stopped from harvesting their crops unless they pay special fees to criminals and rogue elements who are carving out autonomous governing spaces for themselves across the length and breadth of our country,\u201d it said.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general election, NLC said it would lead the Nigerian electorate to ask pertinent questions of development.\n\nIt said that going forward, organised labour would be demanding from politicians and the political class the dividends and returns of the investments.\n\nIn addition, it expressed the resolve at recovering the Labour Party and repositioning it as a vehicle for actualising the desire for a peaceful, united and prosperous nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nNigeria tops the list of African countries that benefitted from the $5 billion raised by Africa\u2019s technology start-ups in 2021 as investors from the United States and China piled into companies that are helping the continent\u2019s tech-savvy and young population conduct financial transactions, a new report has revealed.\n\nThe report further revealed that nearly two-thirds of the top 20 largest disclosed deals involved investors from the US companies including Endeavor Catalyst and Ribbit Capital took part in at least three deals each.\n\nAccording to the report, most of the funding was concentrated in the three traditional start-up hubs on the continent \u2013 Nigeria, which led with over 200 deals, as well as South Africa and Kenya, while Egypt came in fourth.\n\nIn addition, Bezos Expeditions made its maiden investment in the continent, according to the report by Briter Bridges Intelligence, which tracks investments into African start-ups.\n\nBloomberg quoted the report as indicating that there were more than 500 early-stage deals, most of them valued at less than $5 million each, setting the stage for a rush of additional capital into Africa.\n\nInvestors and betting companies such as Chipper Cash, TeamApt Limited and Flutterwave Inc. will benefit from a surge in demand for banking services in a continent that requires strong financial infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe interest in harnessing the business potential in Africa shows no slowing down. It was a year of awakening, where home-grown success stories and the increase in international investors shifting mandates to include Africa have taken a promising leap,\u201d said a Director at Briter Bridges Intelligence, Dario Giuliani.\n\nAbout 40 start-ups raised more than $50 million and some may achieve unicorn status, that is companies valued at more than $1 billion, in the next 12 to 24 months, Giuliani said.\n\nDeals in 2021 were a record-breaking close to $5 billion in disclosed investments, picking up from a pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020.\n\nThe year also saw the launch of multiple Africa-focused funds, including Nigeria\u2019s Ventures Platform that raised $40 million.\n\nMost of the funding was concentrated in the three traditional start-up hubs on the continent, Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, while Egypt came in fourth, attracting about $438 million of investment in 2021, a six-fold increase from 2018.\n\nFintechs attracted the majority of the funding, 62 per cent of investment in 2021 while health and logistics companies were the other sectors to draw investment, according to data from Briter.\n\nThe funding for 2021 was a higher amount than the figure raised in the previous three years combined, according to the report.\n\nThe increased inflows, partly due to investor interest in financial-technology businesses in Africa, helped deliver at least four so-called unicorns, companies worth more than $1 billion, in Africa this year. They include Andela, Flutterwave and OPay.\n\nEarlier data, which put the figure at $4 billion, stated that Nigeria earned the largest, chunk of $1.37 billion.\n\nIt listed Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya as accounting for 80 per cent of the total amount raised on the continent up until the end of November, with 35 per cent of capital raised in Nigeria alone.\n\nWhile Nigerian start-ups raised $1.37 billion in 2021, South Africa raised $838 million; and Kenya, $375 million, with Nigeria boasting over 200 deals for the year.\n\nOther mentions were Senegal, where start-ups raised $222 million in 2021 and Tanzania at $96 million.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There are also instances where the ES kinsmen recommend who gets what from the PTDF. It is such an eyesore as it stands. If urgent steps are not taken, the PTDF might end up in a not too pleasant manner considering the strategic importance of its operations in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nHe further added that the Executive Secretary has formed the habit of bragging about his untouchable status in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\"He usually brags about his connection in the corridors of power and how he also has unhindered access to the President. It is quite sad because Yusuf has turned tyrant in the administration of the PTDF.\u201d\n\nAnother source stated that the Executive Secretary has been using resources from the PTDF to finance political activities in his home state.\n\nHe added that Yusuf has turned to a political cash-cow for politicians from his state.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, it seems the ES has political ambition, or he is sponsoring a political party or candidate in his home state. This is largely responsible for how he has turned the PTDF into an extension of his state. He has also formed the habit of awarding scholarships to select people, mostly from his state,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going at the PTDF, Nigeria might soon experience an embarrassment from foreign institutions where Nigerian students are on scholarship due to non-payment of tuition.\n\n\"We are on the verge of experiencing an embarrassment of unimaginable proportion. You won't believe that the PTDF has not met her obligations with foreign tertiary institutions where you have our students. The ES has diverted monies meant for tuition payment as it stands.\n\n\u201cSince the ES was reappointed, the PTDF has defaulted severally on these payments, not because of lack of funds, but rather the mismanagement of resources by the ES and his cronies. I am afraid that things are not going to change anytime soon with the attitude of the ES with regards to the resources of the organization,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that recruitment into the agency had been contracted to a firm owned by some cronies of Yusuf.\n\n\u201cI know one of those recently employed that didn't attend any interview, but her dad, a close friend of the ES of PTDF, brought home her letter of employment and asked her to resume work.\n\n\"She told me she didn\u2019t apply for a job at the PTDF. But her dad came home with a letter of employment and asked me to resume, which she did.\u201d\n\nAnother staff added that the Executive Secretary has succeeded in rubbishing \u201cwhatever structure left in the organisation\u201d.\n\nHe noted that Yusuf runs the PTDF as a private company where he decides who gets what and when.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that a man could be so brazen in recklessness. He does whatever he wants with the finances of the organisation. He dishes out overinflated contracts to only his kinsmen and many other anomalies that defeat common sense,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Dr Bello Gusau is a monumental embarrassment. The general public should not be deceived by his media grandstanding. We gathered that he has recently engaged the services of a public relations firm to launder his image in the media, all in a bid to cover up for his gross abuse office.\n\n\"I think the honourable thing for him to do is to resign from office because his atrocities are innumerable, as well as despicable. Nigerians should watch out in the days ahead; I am sure more of the rot in the TDF under Dr Bello Gusau would come in the public space,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari had in September 2020 renewed the appointment of Gusau.",

Yobo started as a right-back but was versatile and could handle any role in the defense. He was committed and carried the team on his shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmmanuel Emenike\n\nDuring his prime, he was a very deadly striker. Emenike brought a new dimension to the game when he led the attack at AFCON 2013. He won the golden boot at the tournament.\n\nJohn Obi Mikel\n\nThe versatile attacking midfielder holds a unique place in Nigeria\u2019s football history having inspired the team in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulius Aghahowa\n\nHad injury not curtailed his career and forced him to retire at his peak, Aghahowa may well have been mentioned in the same breath as Rashidi Yekini, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, and Odion Ighalo.\n\nAt the 2000 tournament, he was the jewel in the Super Eagles team. His finest moment came against Morocco and Senegal, with the striker scoring spectacular goals.\n\nJay Jay Okocha\n\nIn a tight final against Cameroon in 2000, Okocha produced a sublime piece of control when he collected Kanu\u2019s pass, before firing a screamer past Alioum Bouka.\n\nHis technique was among the finest ever seen on a football field, and his performance at Tunisia 2004 is just one of a number of breathtaking exhibitions of his skills from a glittering career.",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021!

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns. What do you expect to see in 2022? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "How Nigerian banks frustrate cash trapped customers",
          "text": "Customers of Nigerian banks have decried the inability of the lenders to make cash available on the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and even online transfers when needed.\n\nThis, however, has been attributed to operational problems rather than liquidity issues as some analysts believe that if such persists, the financial inclusion drive of the central bank would be at risk.\n\nAt the convenience of her home in Amuwo Odofin, Lagos, a middle-aged woman used the USSD code of her bank to transfer N100,000 to a customer with a UBA account on December 18, 2021 but was not successful.\n\nThe response she received after initiating the transaction was, \u201cyour account is restricted please dial *737*20*BVN# or visit any GTBank branch to link your BVN to your account.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was sure that her account had been linked to her BVN, however, followed the instruction, only to receive another response, which read, \u201cYour account is already linked to your account. Dial *568*0# to confirm your BVN.\u201d\n\nOn different occasions at Lagos Island, customers were seen moving from one ATM machine to the other in search of cash but were disappointed.\n\nThe response displayed by one of the ATMs of a first-generation bank was, \u201cthis transaction cannot be completed\u201d and the second ATM machine said \u201cno service.\u201d\n\nIt was either the ATM machines of commercial banks around Marina area of Lagos that could not dispense cash or the cash transactions were delayed due to network issues.\n\nSome banks\u2019 ATM machines visited randomly by BusinessDay during the festive period were the ones owned by First Bank of Nigeria, GTBank, UBA, FCMB, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Polaris Bank, among others.\n\nResponding to the development, Muda Yusuf, CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), said this may slightly be a technology issue, noting, \u201cI believe that it is a question of the banks strengthening their technology capacity to be able to handle some of these transactions.\u201d\n\nHe said quite a lot of transactions were taking place online these days, adding that the use of cash was getting lower.\n\nRead also: CBN\u2019s interventions drive banks\u2019 credit to private sector growth\n\nAs more transactions migrate online or through electronic channels, he said the capacity of channels needs to be strengthened so that some of the downtime, failure of PoS, failure of ATMs, network collapsing in the banks, and all that would be reduced.\n\n\u201cI think it is a technology issue. So, we have to engage the banks to make sure that they invest a lot more in technology, and we also need to appeal to the government to support the telcos who are providing the backbone for some of these technologies to happen.\n\n\u201cSomething like the fibre optic cables and technology. All of these things are very important ICT infrastructure that other sectors of the economy need. But as for cash, I am not sure that there is any bank that is insolvent. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any bank that is distressed. So, people are not able to get cash because there is a challenge with technology,\u201d Yusuf told BusinessDay.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said a key focus of the central bank under his leadership had been enabling the build-out of a robust payment system that will provide cheap, efficient, and faster means of conducting payments for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWith the growing pace of digitisation globally, it is essential that we leverage digital channels in fulfilling this objective,\u201d he said.\n\nTotal transaction volumes using digital channels more than doubled between 2018 and 2020, as volumes rose from 1.3 billion to over 3.3 billion financial transactions in 2020. Digital payment channels, he said, also help to support the continued conduct of business activities during the lockdown.\n\n\u201cOur robust payment system has continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in Nigeria. Reflecting the confidence in our payment system, between 2015 and September 2021, about $900 million has been invested in firms run by Nigerian founders,\u201d Emefiele said.",

          "title": "How Nigerians can sing a new song in 2022",
          "text": "It was endless back-slapping yesterday as Nigerians joined the rest of the world to wish one another a happy new year and general goodwill. But the good wishes of new songs would, to a large extent, depend on what the socio-economic and political firmament would look like; observers told BusinessDaySunday.\n\nThe out-gone year was hell for many citizens on all fronts.\n\nIf one considers the realities on the ground, especially the economic downturn, a new song might elude Nigerians this New Year, except things are consciously done differently by the government and the people.\n\nAs much as the country and her citizens, who were battered by intense hardship, escalating insecurity, and the lingering impact of the pandemic, yarn for respite from their agonies of 2021, it is only a concerned government, which is ready to walk its talk that can make a new song possible and louder in 2022.\n\nMany concerned Nigerians and observers think that the country can bounce back in her economy, security, as well as, overcome other challenges if the leadership is determined to walk its talk, at least, for the first time.\n\nStarting from the base, observers argue that if the government had given license to many investors to build refineries, given them deadlines, monitor the projects, and offer them other incentives, the fear of subsidy removal by the middle of this year and the consequent hike in prices would have been averted.\n\n\u201cWeather Nigerians will sing a new song or not depends on our government. Ordinarily, coming out of 2021 was a miracle because of the hardship that overstretched Nigerians. It was a year when prices of goods tripled in just one month, a year that more Nigerians fell under poverty threshold and a year that many will curse if allowed,\u201d Paul Oghenkor, a lawyer and Lagos landlord, said.\n\nLamenting further, the landlord said: \u201cConsidering the debt pile, a sensitive government will not borrow again, rather manage and look for ways to stimulate the economy, get many entrepreneurs back on track and encourage companies rather than kill them with stifling policies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a new song is possible if government walks its talk on the diversification of the economy, recover the billions of Naira lost to gas flaring every day in the Niger Delta, open other seaports to importers of bulk goods to reduce the cost of transportation to final destinations, which impact prices, and encourage investors in technology companies and creative industry.\n\n\u201cWe all know that oil prices have never been stable for a long time now and will not in the future. So, we need to consciously develop other sectors of the economy to boost revenue. If Hollywood is raking billions of dollars for the United States of America\u2019s economy, Nollywood can do the same if encouraged and supported,\u201d Oghenkor said.\n\nExpressing his views on diversification of the economy as a means of salvaging the country this year, Nkereuwem Onung, president, Federation of Tourism Associations of Nigeria (FTAN), insisted that tourism offers diverse opportunities, amid huge capacity for employment.\n\nHe also noted that the umbrella body of tourism practitioners in Nigeria has credible members who are willing to partner with others for sustainable development of tourism in a way that it will earn foreign exchange and huge revenue for the country like some destinations such as Dubai, South Africa, Kenya, France, and Spain.\n\nThe same view was shared by Patrick Utomi, founder, Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL) and political economist, while as a keynote speaker at the annual general meeting of the National Association of Tour Operators (NATOP) in Calabar, recently.\n\nUtomi disclosed that tourism was the lowest hanging fruit for economic diversification due to its easy entry, it does not require huge capital investment and grows profit easily.\n\nFor him, the government can identify credible stakeholders in the tourism industry to partner with for sustainable tourism development projects that can impact the economy within a short period, though long-term investment in the sector is also necessary.\n\nThe professor observed that in Nigerian tourism, there seems to be a missing link, especially in a diversified economy, hence the need to train and direct Nigerian tourism stakeholders on better ways of marketing Nigerian as a tourism destination.\n\nDimifa Alagha, an investment banker with StanbicIBTC, pointed out that the prevailing policies in the country do not support investments, especially foreign direct investments, and that the government needs to change such policies in order to attract investors this year, who will help stimulate the economy.\n\n\u201cIn economies like Nigeria, it is the SMEs that are the backbone of the economy, but the policies and the business environment have not been favorable for them. If you want a better 2022, the government should consciously pull the SMEs out of the brick and the lingering impact of the pandemic. Again, the government should intervene with soft loans because high-interest rates, impossible collateral, and low purchasing power are challenging SMEs now more than before,\u201d Alagha said.\n\nThe investment banker argued that the government cannot pressure SMEs with unfavorable policies, amid multiple taxations and still expect the economy to improve this year.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired of promises, the government should learn from other economies that pass through a similar experience and how they managed to stabilise their economies. It is not all about loans and obeying World Bank orders, it is about finding what works for us and implementing them, loans do not work for us, they mortgaged our future,\u201d he said.\n\nHannah Irem, a mother of three and businesswoman, thinks that 2022 will be better if the government is sincere with the masses, and also avoid price hikes in fuel pump price, electricity tariff and other things that induce inflation.\n\n\u201cDo not promise what you cannot fulfill; do not increase something you cannot reduce, leave us to manage until when a messiah will come. You want to increase fuel price as if the masses are the reason the refineries are not working,\u201d she said.\n\nLai Omotola, group managing director, Masters Reality International Concepts Limited (MRICL), and chancellor of E-Boot Camp Limited, said that for those in business, like himself, to sing a new song this year, the government must try to reduce the hassles associated with doing business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe economy remains very vital to our welfare and indeed affects all aspects of our lives. This is why everybody wants to know how the economy is doing. There are certain indices that people look at to know how the economy is doing. What are those indices for the economy? Number one is inflation, which has accelerated fast and it is now 15.99 percent. Inflation of double-digit means that we need to raise the serious alarm.\n\n\u201cAnother one is the exchange rate which is at N575 to the dollar and you look at what was the exchange rate in 2015. Then, you look at the size of the economy in terms of the GDP which is at $440 billion. This for a giant of Africa is little. When you look at the budget size for 2022 is N16 trillion. The question is how are we going to spend the budget? The government is saying that there is going to be a deficit of N6.3 trillion out of the N16 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhat is the deficit? It means that we have a budget but we do not have enough money to cover it and we are going to borrow N6.3 trillion either from domestic or foreign. So, that begins to raise a flag. We are even budgeting beyond what we produce, which is a no from day one but they say we need to continue that way otherwise the economy will shut down.\u201d\n\nAccording to Omotola, \u201cWhen one looks at the budget to find out what we are spending money on, you will find out that out of the N16 trillion, we are spending N6.8 trillion on recurrent expenditure, which is close to 30 percent of the budget. On personnel cost, we will be spending N4.11trillion. Then, the question is which government parastatal in Nigeria can one enjoy excellent customer care service. Can one have a good experience at General Hospital, Passport Office or Police despite the amount spent annually on personnel cost?\n\n\u201cAnother question is- where is this money coming from? The budget says that 80 percent of the funding will come from oil. This means that for the past 60 years that we have been talking about diversification, we still remain in the same place.\n\n\u201cNigerian oil still provides 95 percent of foreign exchange and 80 percent of budgetary revenue. This means that Nigeria still remains a mono-economy. So, 20 years of democracy plus 32 years of military dictatorship, have not shifted us forward but we have gone backward.\u201d\n\nOmotola, who is a real estate player, told BusinessDaySunday that unless Nigeria begins to implement her ideas and policies, the new song may not be possible for the country this year.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to achieve a turnaround in her economy and record the desired change, the country must be looking not only for an ideas man but for an executioner that can say that the Niger Bridge, for instance, will be ready on October 1, 2022, and it will be so. An executioner will say that the three refineries in Warri, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna will be ready by 2023, and it will be.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigeria finds that executioner, our journey will still continue to manifest the way it has always been. It is now about executing ideas rather than giving talk shows, and seminars. We usually say that leadership is the problem of this country but we have now realised that human capital drain is totally on the increase and worse than leadership. This means that there is a vacuum of knowledge. Scarcity of knowledge is one of the reasons why we are where we are today.\u201d\n\nHumphrey Bamisebi Olumakaiye, diocesan bishop of Lagos and archbishop, Ecclesiastical Province of Lagos, urged both the leaders and the led to work positively for the good of the nation and the citizenry.\n\nAccording to Olumakaiye, \u201cEach New Year offers a blank sheet of rewriting history and changing the narrative. It is God\u2019s benevolent gift of time to etch our footprints in the sand of history. Indeed, New Year is a new window of opportunity to be a better person in character, disposition, and attitude. With the arrival of another 365 days comes another door of hope to rise from the shadow and shine the light in an ever-increasingly dark world. Therefore, the desire of the Lord Almighty is that we should all seize the moment and embrace this gift of time with resolute determination. The chance to make the right impact is for all and on all; for leaders and followers; for men and women; for boys and girls \u2013 without discrimination and partiality.\u201d",

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "For the Record: \u2018Wake Up and Help Save Our Tomorrow!\u2019 \u2013 Text of Open Letter By Emeka Obasi Jnr to African Youths on Climate Change",
          "text": "Fellow Youths of our beloved continent, it is with a heart full of trepidation, but also optimism, that I write to you this day. My trepidation stems from the fact that our continent is in danger, threatened menacingly by climate change. Already, Africa is confronted by the twin challenge of insecurity and poverty, but climate change now threatens the continent\u2019s very existence.\n\nBut I am also optimistic about the future of our continent. I look at the numbers; the millions of young Africans doing exploits globally, and particularly at the fact that a vast majority of the population of Africa are young people, and my heart is gladdened. Yes, the challenge of climate change is enormous, but I\u2019m confident that we have what it takes as youths of Africa to galvanize action towards averting the climate crisis that now stare us in the face, which is why I am writing to you today.\n\nLike many of you, I was born at the turn of the 21st Century. Indeed, I was born 21 years ago, at a very auspicious time in the history of mankind. It was a time when an old age had just passed away, giving birth to the new millennium. I was born at exactly 1pm on the first day of the first month of the first year of the new millennium, precisely on January 1st, 2001, at 1pm.\n\nMy mother keeps telling me that I\u2019m a special child; that maybe God wanted me to come on such symbolic day in order to make my life story more engaging.\n\nI spent my early childhood in Lagos, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest city. It\u2019s where I grew up and where I had my early education. I only travelled out during the holidays or during school excursion trips.\n\nLooking back on those years, I find it remarkable that despite maintaining great interest in current affairs, especially given the fact that my father is a Journalist, I never became conscious of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. It was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries.\n\nBut I find it inexcusable, and almost unforgivable that despite living my first decade and a half in Lagos; a city so threatened by climate change that scientists have projected that it may become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise, I did not become conscious of climate change and indeed the environment. What it underlines is the acute lack of deliberate policies to create awareness among the younger generation of Africans.\n\nLagos is a coastal city with a population of 24 million and is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100 as a result of global warming. According to certain scientific projections, Lagos could become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise.\n\nIt is, however, heartwarming that the state is already taking action to ensure that this potential disaster is averted. Not long ago, the the Lagos State government unveiled a five-year Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2020-2025. The goal, as stated by Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, is to achieve an emission-neutral city by 2050.\n\nBut the case of Lagos state is not unique. It typifies the acute environmental problems facing many parts of Nigeria. There is increasing desertification in the North, which has had very huge impact on security in the country; erosion in the East; oil spillage in the South/South, among others. The scenario is similar in other parts of Africa. Global warming is expected to melt Africa\u2019s remaining glaciers in the next few decades, and the reduction in water essential to agricultural production will create food insecurity, poverty, and population displacement.\n\nAgriculture, which remains heavily dependent on rainfall, is critical to Africa\u2019s economic growth, thus, climate change could potentially destabilize local markets, increase food insecurity, limit economic growth, escalate insecurity and increase risk for agriculture sector investors. Without doubt, for Africa to survive, sustained action must be taken beginning from today.\n\nIn this, our generation has a very critical role to play, because as we say in Nigeria, the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. If we analyse that saying well, it makes a lot of sense. Of course, the future belongs to the younger generation \u2013 it is their inheritance \u2013 but as an old African saying has it, the young shall grow.\n\nThe question I ask is, when the young must have grown, then what happens? The expectation is that when the young grow they will inherit the Earth. My worry is in what shape that Earth will be.\n\nSo, it is important that young people become involved in the global effort to ensure that the Earth is in fit and proper condition to make a worthwhile inheritance. Therefore, the effort to improve the environment should be championed by the youths because the world of tomorrow belongs to us.\n\nWhereas it is true that today belongs to our fathers and mothers, tomorrow belongs to the children; to us, and what we do today will surely determine the fate of our tomorrow and the fate of those coming after us. Therefore, I have resolved to contribute my own quota towards the global push to create a more sustainable, safer, cleaner and healthier environment for the future by setting up an NGO, \u201cOur Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe NGO will become an active player in the climate change ecosystem and I am committed to getting the youths of Africa to commit to this noble endeavour.\n\nOur tomorrow has a three point agenda:\n\nTo wake African youths up to the reality of the existential threat climate change poses to their future.\n\nTo sensitize African leaders, both at the government, corporate and non-governmental levels, to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change.\n\nTo mobilize resources, both material and human, to campaign and create sustained awareness of Africans, especially the youths, on the need to be actively involved in the battle to save the environment for their future and for future generations.\n\nFor me, it is a struggle of a lifetime. It is a call which I feel honoured to answer.\n\nAs the great Marxian philosopher, Frantz Fanon, once wrote: Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its true mission and either fulfil or betray it. I am proud to state that as an African youth, I have found my mission and by the grace of God, I will not betray it.\n\nMy target is to mobilise the teeming populace of the youths in Africa to achieve a critical mass of climate change advocates, whose voices will resonate loudly and clearly and catalyse positive action. We will use the awesome power of social media to create this unstoppable army and empower their voices in every country in Africa.\n\nIndeed, the prospects are exciting, I invite all African youths to this adventure.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nPrince Emeka Obasi junior.\n\nAston University, Birmingham, England.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Nurses in Lagos State under the umbrella of Lagos State Council of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) are to embark on three-day warning strike from January 10 over unmet demands by the state government.\n\nNANNM gave the order for its members to embark on the strike action in a circular signed by its state secretary, Oloruntoba Odumosu with REF NO: NANNM/LS/SEC/VOL.II/148/001 and addressed to members of the association in the state.\n\nThe circular said that the SEC of the association resolved to embark on the warning strike at its meeting held on December 29, 2021, accusing the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of failure to meet its demands.\n\nThis strike notice is coming a few months after the union abruptly aborted its decision to go on an indefinite strike in September 2021, following the last-minute approval of its request for payment of uniform allowance for its members by the government.\n\nWhile the government has failed to meet other demands aside from the payment of the uniform allowance, the union has reiterated some of the existing issues in the new directive.\n\nThe union highlighted eight issues in the circular, including what it described as the acute shortage of nurses and midwives in the state owned health facilities; payment of retention allowance, regularisation of graduate and stagnated nurses, improved welfare and working condition of nurses, improved hazard allowance, and life Insurance scheme for nurses and other health workers, among others.\n\nThe union also noted that the Federal Health Institutions have been exempted from the strike, which it noted would be monitored for strict compliance.\n\n\u201cThe struggle at hand requires the commitment and steadfastness of all members. We urge you all to play your part well,\u201d the union wrote.\n\nBefore the union rescinded its decision to go on strike in September, it gave a 21-day ultimatum to the government, threatening to down tools should it fail to pay the allowances or put in place concrete steps to commence the processes.\n\nThe union accused the government of \u201csectarianism\u201d, saying while those working under the state\u2019s health service commission are unpaid, their counterparts at the primary health care board and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) have either received their payment or were in the process of receiving it.\n\nIts strike notice, which was addressed to the governor in September, had read in part; \u201cAs of now, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) and the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board have commenced the payment of the allowance to nurses and midwives.\n\n\u201cPayment at the Ministry of Health would commence soon. The Health Service Commission where a large percentage of nurses and midwives in the state are domiciled is yet to commence payment and has informed us it made no provision for the payment of the allowance\n\n\u201cWe would want to make it unequivocal that a situation where the Health Service Commission Nurses and Midwives would not be paid the uniform allowance for this year cannot be contemplated and would not be tolerated at all.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you take this letter as both a reminder and an ultimatum for possible commencement of industrial action. If we do not have concrete assurances in terms of the approval of the governor and steps for the commencement of the payment within the next 21 days, the council would be left with no other choice than to take industrial action to press home our request.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari gets 14-day deadline to probe misuse of security votes by govs",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has been issued 14-day deadline to probe alleged misuse of security votes by governors of the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) issued the deadline in a statement on Sunday, urging Buhari direct the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice,, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN and appropriate anti-corruption agencies to promptly and thoroughly investigate allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999.\n\nSERAP said: \u201cAnyone suspected to be responsible should face prosecution as appropriate, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and any mismanaged public funds should be fully recovered.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in his 2022 New Year Message raised concerns about \u201cthe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country,\u201d and promised to \u201cremain resolute in our commitments\u201d to give \u201cutmost attention to the problem.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated 1 January 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cThe most satisfactory and effective way to demonstrate the oft-repeated commitments to address the insecurity in the country is to promptly and thoroughly probe persistent allegations of corruption in the spending of security votes by state governors.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cProbing the spending of security votes and ensuring accountability for any cases of corruption would improve the ability of your government to deliver on the promises to ensure the security of Nigerians, and to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part, \u201cEnding impunity for allegations of corruption in the spending of security votes and recovering any mismanaged public funds are matters of public interest.\n\n\u201cAs revealed by a recent report by Transparency International (TI), most of the funds appropriated as security votes are spent on political activities, mismanaged or simply stolen. It is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year.\n\n\u201cOn top of appropriated security votes, state governments also receive millions of dollars yearly as international security assistance.\n\n\u201cLongstanding allegations of corruption and mismanagement of security votes have hugely contributed to the growing insecurity in the country, and the failure of authorities to effectively discharge their constitutional responsibility to ensure the security and welfare of their own people.\n\n\u201cPervasive tendency by public officers to regard or treat security votes given to them for security of the state as their personal entitlement or funds is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and international standards. Security votes should be used for improving the security situation in the states or returned to the public treasury.\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments have failed to effectively discharge their primary and constitutional responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Nigerian people. This is patently contrary to Section 14(2)(b) of the Nigerian Constitution, which provides that: \u2018the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\u2019.\n\n\u201cAgainst the background of well-documented cases of abduction, killings and ongoing security challenges in several parts of the country, the time has come to end the culture of impunity for allegations of corruption and mismanagement of public funds meant to ensure the security of life and property of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, your government\u2019s responsibility to guarantee and ensure the security and welfare of the Nigerian people is interlinked with the responsibility under Section 15(5) of the Constitution to \u2018abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of office.\u2019 This imposes a fundamental obligation to ensure accountability for the spending of security votes by state governors.\n\n\u201cWhile sitting state governors may enjoy immunity from arrest and prosecution, they do not enjoy immunity from investigation. Any allegations of mismanagement of security votes against sitting governors can and should be investigated pending the time they leave office and lose immunity. The findings of such investigation can also be the basis for initiating impeachment proceedings against any indicted governor.\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to instruct the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to jointly track and monitor spending of security votes by the 36 state governors.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that in your 2022 New Year Message to Nigerians, you raised concerns about \u2018the persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country,\u2019 and the effects on the socio-economic conditions of millions of people, as well as promised to \u2018remain resolute in our commitments\u2019 to give \u2018utmost attention\u2019 to the problem, and to address \u2018human security at the grassroots.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP also notes your expressed commitment to give \u2018the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses\u2019 in any part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the Incorporated Trustees of SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.",

          "title": "My persecutors planned to drug, undress, film me among prostitutes \u2013 Mbaka",
          "text": "Fiery Catholic priest and founder of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka has said that his sudden disappearance sometime in 2021 was meant to hack him to death by those he said were persecuting him.\n\nAccording to The Nation, the cleric said that the plan was to take and drug him, undress him before prostitutes and film him where he would be seen frolicking with prostitutes before hacking him to death.\n\nMbaka also said that he never asked anyone to vote for Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria during his 2015 prophecy.\n\nMbaka was invited to the Bishop\u2019s Court after asking President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached in May last year with the presidency firing back and alleging that the cleric was angry because he sought to secure contracts from the Buhari-led government and was denied\n\nDuring his invitation to the Bishop\u2019s Court, his phones went off and nothing was heard from him after several hours, a development that forced his followers to besiege the Bishop\u2019s Court and demand his immediate release.\n\nExplaining what happened in that incident in his 2022 New Year message during the cross over night at the Adoration Ground, Emene, Enugu, Mbaka said the people who caused his disappearance wanted to give him the Nnamdi Kanu treatment.\n\nHe told the congregation, \u201cThe day you went on rampage looking for me, they would have killed me that night.\n\n\u201cThe way they took Nnamdi Kanu was what they planned to do to me. They would have picked me up and drugged me and I would be acting under the influence of that drug.\n\n\u201cBut the Holy Spirit already gave me an order on Sunday night. It is that kind of order that is called \u2018supernatural mandamus\u2019. The Holy Spirit told me never to park in a place for 20 minutes. You know I was given an order not to come into this adoration ground for 30 days.\n\n\u201cI was invited for a meeting and on my arrival, I noticed that it was a panel that was sitting about me. It was on that panel that I was ordered not to conduct adoration again for 30 days. They also said that I shouldn\u2019t come into my house for 30 days. I told them that I didn\u2019t have any toiletries, took brush and even money to buy them and that I would need to get home to pick some things before going but they refused and yet, I obeyed.\n\n\u201cBut the Holy Spirit told me to be careful with my obedience and never to park anyhow. I never knew that the Holy Spirit already knew that I was under watch. I parked my car in front of St. Joseph and I went to pray for like 15 to 20 minutes. I never knew they were tracking me that night.\n\n\u201cBefore the next morning when you people started looking for me, their plan was immediately they picked me up, they would take me to Cubana Junction where they would parade me among prostitutes. They would also show a video where I was frolicking with the prostitutes. The question would have been: what was Mbaka doing in this kind of place?\n\n\u201cFrom Cubana, they would have taken me to the one in front of Igboeze where prostitutes also stay. This was where they had planned to undress me. The question would have been, what was he doing there naked.\u201d\n\nThe priest disclosed that the grand plan was to take him to Abuja and kill me along the road.\n\nHe however withdrew the apologies he gave to Enugu Catholic Bishop, Callistus Onaga, after his disappearance last year, saying the reverse should be the case.\n\nHis words: \u201cI was apologizing after everything that happened. But two days ago, I was asking myself, why should I apologise to anyone? I shouldn\u2019t have apologised at all. They should be the ones to apologise to me because they wronged me.\n\n\u201cThey should be very careful, otherwise they will get the treatment my uncle got for always beating my father before us and his children when I was still a little boy.\n\n\u201cThis uncle kept beating my father till he lost one of his teeth as a result of the constant beatings. And on each occasion, my father would keep crying and I would do nothing because I was still a young boy.\n\n\u201cWhen I entered secondary school, I joined Taekwondo training to enable me to gather enough skills and tactics to fight back for my father. I was still leading Block Rosary and Charismatic very well.\n\n\u201cIt was after I was ordained a deacon that my uncle beat a tooth out of my father\u2019s mouth. In my uncle\u2019s mind, I would still do nothing about that because I was already a deacon. But I returned home to teach my uncle a great lesson he never forgot in his lifetime. I used him to show off my taekwondo skills and he found himself crying and begging for forgiveness.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m begging those who have set out to persecute Mbaka to leave me alone. I\u2019m over obedient (to the authorities of the church). If you ask me to kneel down, I will lie down. But, will my children (members of adoration) watch me lying down? That is the problem. Look at the crowd here (over hundred thousand worshippers). It is no longer Mbaka that is being persecuted. Nothing is too much to fight for a father.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading that 2022 should be a year of peace. Fr. Mbaka has continued to embrace peace to the extent of mounting the kind of a giant billboard in front of the ministry. The Pope\u2019s picture and all the bishops are there. Someone who is doing all this, do you still think he is quarreling with anyone?\n\n\u201cAnyone persecuting me and this Adoration Ministry is persecuting the Holy Spirit. He should be ready to bear any consequences that follow.\n\n\u201cFrom the one room I was given at Umuchigbo, God has given us a place (Adoration Ministry) he wants us to stay. This ground was an evil forest. I know what I did to remove the various deities in this forest before making it inhabitable.\n\n\u201cPeople should stop attacking this Ministry. It is where Igbos are getting their liberation. It is where souls are liberated.\u201d\n\nWith the over hundred thousand participants in the adoration ground on Friday night, Mbaka said even the Pope would be proud of the Ministry and do everything possible to protect it.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the church appreciate what she has? What kind of fight is this? The worst is that some priests are joining in this rubbish. Priests should not create \u2018anti-clericalism\u2019 because the lay people will soon begin to insult and attack them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cleric who intensified prayers for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in 2022, saying he sees the IPOB leader as his son.\n\nHe however pleaded with fellow priests to stop castigating him for praying for and blessing Kanu over his travail.\n\nMbaka said: \u201cI\u2019m begging my fellow priests to stop condemning me for praying for Nnamdi Kanu. I am not closing any priest\u2019s mouth and nobody should close my own. If I use my mouth to bless Nnamdi Kanu and you don\u2019t like it, please use your own mouth to curse him. Leave me to bless him.\n\n\u201cI see Nnamdi Kanu as my son. Every Igbo man and woman is my child. You may not understand the spiritual authority I have on this land.\n\n\u201cIf as a church, we can be praying for Nigeria in distress, nobody can stop us from praying for Nnamdi Kanu and our brothers in distress.\n\n\u201cThis year will be for Kanu and those held for agitations. God will show them mercy this year.\u201d\n\nHe thanked his followers for treating him as their shepherd, saying, \u201cI thank you all for listening to me as you rampaged and were about to destroy things. But immediately I called on you to be calm, you calmed down and avoided destruction of things. I\u2019m happy for your obedience.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything wrong. They\u2019re just trying to touch the tail of the lion. They should know that such an action has serious consequences.\n\n\u201cThey should look for those who are disturbing them. We\u2019re not disturbing anyone. In fact, we have never come to this ground to say anything bad about our bishop. We have never said any bad prayer against the bishop. Every time we remember him, it is blessings all through that we declare for him.\n\n\u201cSo, someone I call father should treat me equally as a son. You can\u2019t push somebody to the level of rebellion. It will look ridiculous for you to experience what happened to my uncle who beat out one of my father\u2019s teeth, I used him to show off my taekwondo and judo skills. And people couldn\u2019t believe that a man on his way to becoming a priest could act like that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of priest the society needs. When the masses are being maltreated, he speaks. If you are a governor, you already know that you must do well.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to correct the impression people had about his 2015 prophecy on Buhari\u2019s presidency.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen I said that Buhari would be president, I didn\u2019t tell anyone to vote for Buhari. But people were just quoting me out of context. I told you that it was revealed to me that Buhari would be president. That it was revealed to me doesn\u2019t mean that you should vote for him. What it meant was that whether you voted or not, Buhari would emerge as president. It\u2019s a vision. I also said that if he began to mess up that I would attack him.

          "text": "The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, says God has not told him who will become Nigeria\u2019s President in 2023.\n\nThe respected cleric said this on Saturday during the 2022 Crossover Service of the church held at the RCCG International Headquarters along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nAdeboye, while announcing his prophecies for the Year 2022, said many people had been asking him who would succeed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in May 2023.\n\nHe, however, said God had not revealed Nigeria\u2019s next President to him, adding that prophecy is no guesswork.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, Adeboye said, \u201cI just want to give you a hint of what Daddy (God) says is in store for the New Year. There are all manners of prophets out there. So, you will be hearing all manners of prophecies in the coming days. I am talking to you my children, not criticising anybody. I have my duty to make sure I teach my own children.\n\n\u201cWhen God speaks, He speaks specifically. There is no may be or perhaps; He speaks. So, if you hear somebody prophesy, \u2018It is likely one of the following people will succeed\u2019, that\u2019s not a prophecy; that\u2019s personal opinion. When God speaks, He will say, \u2018This fellow will succeed, that fellow is not going to make it\u2019. That is the way God speaks; He doesn\u2019t say, \u2018It is likely\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe 79-year-old cleric took a trip down memory lane and narrated how he was asked who would become Nigeria\u2019s President in 1993. Adeboye said as the then President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, he was approached by his fellow pastors to know who would become Nigeria\u2019s President between MKO Abiola of the Social Democratic Party and Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention during the planned transition to civilian rule by the military.\n\nThe cleric said, \u201cWhen God speaks, some of the things He says may baffle your brain a little. Let me give you an example. I have always told you I am not a prophet; I am only a pastor but I hear from God once in a while.\n\n\u201cYears ago, there were three people contesting to be President of Nigeria\u2014 (MKO) Abiola, Aminu Kano and (Bashir) Tofa. At that time, I was President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria and so the other Pentecostal people asked me, \u2018Sir, what do we do? Who do we vote for? There are three of them \u2013 all Muslims. Who is going to win sir?\u2019 I said, \u2018None\u2019. They said, \u2018How can that be? If you toss a coin, when it lands, it is either head or tail\u2019. I said, \u2018None\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Why?\u2019 I said because God told me. He spoke in parables. He said the winner will be the loser, the loser will be the winner and luckiest of them is Aminu Kanu. Aminu Kanu died before the election. Abiola won but he never got to the throne and the fellow who lost at least didn\u2019t have the embarrassment of winning and not reigning. The winner is the loser and the loser is the winner, the luckiest of them was the one who died. When it played out, my colleagues came to me and said, \u2018Well, it seems as if you really heard.\u2019\u201d\n\nContinuing, Adeboye said, \u201cFor example, if somebody asks me today like many people are already doing, \u2018Daddy, who is going to be our next President?\u2019 The answer is: I don\u2019t know. \u2018How can you say you don\u2019t know? You\u2019re Daddy\u2019s (God\u2019s) son.\u2019 He hasn\u2019t told me yet. You don\u2019t do guesswork with prophecy.\u201d\n\nThe cleric, who grouped his prophecies for Year 2022 into three categories\u2014 personal, Nigeria and intercontinental\u2014 said God told him specifically that in 2022, \u201cMore than 80 per cent of projects starting in 2022 will succeed.\n\n\u201cThis year will be a year of the emergence of previously unknown stars.\n\n\u201cIn spite of everything happening, this year will be a year of some massive breakthroughs (in science and finance).\n\n\u201cInfant mortality rate will drop by at least 50 per cent.\u201d\n\nFor Nigeria, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t make omelette without breaking eggs.\u201d According to the Oxford Lexico dictionary, the English proverb means: One cannot accomplish something without adverse effects elsewhere.\n\nOn the intercontinental scene, Adeboye said, \u201cThe issue of migration will take a new turn in the new year.\n\n\u201cThere will be two monstrous storms (one coming from the Atlantic Ocean and one from the Pacific Ocean). Unless they are weakened, the results will be terrible.\u201d",

The lessons of the past year will serve as a useful instrument that will guide us to fruition in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ortom thanked the Benue people who stood by him through thick and thin, promising that their interest, welfare, and well-being would remain his firm commitment, mission, and purpose throughout the days of his administration.\n\nHe assured them that his administration would continue to implement policies, programmes, and projects that have a direct and positive impact on them.\n\nThe governor, however, urged the people to be vigilant against terrorists who have continued to wreck communities and displace people from their ancestral lands.\n\nHe encouraged individuals and groups to ensure that they cooperate with the security agencies so as to keep the state free from criminal activities of terrorist gangs, saying, \u201cIn doing so, you must endeavour to give useful information to government through security operatives in order to nip any threat in the bud\u201d.\n\nFor the governor, this is necessary to ensure a smooth and orderly society as the nation approaches the 2023 general elections. He reminded the electorate to make informed and right choices during the elections.\n\nHe promised them that his administration would leave Benue State better than he met it and wished the residents a peaceful and prosperous new year.\n\nKeep Hope Alive\n\nOn his part, Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, assured the people of the state of a glorious and eventful 2022, with a promise of a full crystallization of a vision started over six years ago.\n\nHe stated that given the aggressive industrialisation drive of his administration which began barely one year into office, the state was already on an irreversible path to economic prosperity and greatness.\n\nThanking the people for their fidelity and unwavering support for his administration in the past years, the governor urged them to embrace the new year with steadfastness, faith, and hope.\n\nHe maintained that his administration has been able to firmly secure the future of the state through massive industrialisation with the establishment of industries across the state.\n\nGovernor Ayade called on residents to put the state above narrow considerations and not allow self-seeking politicians to manipulate them for their selfish end.\n\nHe also urged them to keep hope alive, wished them a refreshing and fulfilling new year, and asked them not to be complacent in complying with the COVID-19 protocols, especially in the face of the fast-spreading variant \u2013 omicron.\n\nBetter Days\n\nIn Adamawa, Governor Umaru Fintiri called on Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of forgiveness, love, reconciliation, and re-dedication to the service of God and humanity in the year 2022.\n\n\u201cThe end of the year and the beginning of a new one provides us all with an opportunity for reflection and introspection, as well as to plan,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut most importantly, it is a time to give thanks to the Almighty God for the gift and for his care and provision to all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile wishing the people of Adamawa a happy, safe and prosperous 2022, the governor noted the plans and efforts of the government.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for bringing us safely to the end of an eventful year. As we celebrate the end of an extraordinary year and look forward with hope to personal, state, and national progress in 2022, I urge you to be more committed to the Adamawa project and support our plans for the economic development of the state, as we intend to do more in terms of infrastructural renewal, human capital development, and welfare of our people,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLooking back on the achievements and milestones made in the course of 2021, I know that there are those among us who have had a very difficult year, either economically or through personal tragedies such as the loss of loved ones, or those battling illnesses and other troubling situations.\n\n\u201cTo you, it is my hope and prayer that the new year will usher in better days for you and for all of us\u201d.\n\nThe governor specifically praised healthcare givers as the world battles the omicron COVID-19 variant and encouraged people to be vaccinated against the pandemic.\n\n\u2018We Emerged Victorious\u2019\n\n\u201cThe year 2021 was historic for Ndi Imo, partly with the wrong reasons but largely, for the remarkable records, we have achieved in tackling challenges that confronted us as a state,\u201d Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State said in his New Year message.\n\nHe added, \u201cDespite the distorted flow of governance, we sailed through with dedication, commitment and progression. All these were made feasible by the unflinching support and resilience of Ndi Imo, which I do not take for granted. Through thick and thin, we emerged victorious to the glory of God Almighty and his grace shall abound in this new year.\n\n\u201cHaving recorded tremendous results in the restoration of peace and tranquillity in our dear state, it is now time to tackle development head-on. The expectations of Ndi Imo in this regard, shall not be cut short for we have set in motion, mechanisms to actualise these.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing, I, therefore, welcome Ndi Imo nile to the year 2022. Having signed into law, the People\u2019s Budget of 2022 as appropriated by the people\u2019s representatives, the implementation shall reflect the developmental and economic expectations of Ndi Imo in this 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we offer thanksgiving to the Lord for His faithfulness and mercies, let us endeavour to be a reflection of His goodness in our society and to our neighbours, for in a harmonious and peaceful cohabitation, development thrives faster.\n\n\u201cI celebrate Ndi Imo nile and welcome you, once again, to the year 2022, with compliments.\u201d\n\nShow Optimism\n\nIn Niger State, Governor Abubakar Bello called on the residents to continue to have hope and trust in the ability of his administration to work for the progress, growth, and development of the state.\n\nThe governor said the state government would work towards the successful actualisation of its programmes and policies as captured in the 2022 budget.\n\nHe urged the people to show optimism and be encouraged by the fact that his administration would not relent in sustaining the ongoing infrastructural revolution aimed at improving the general well-being of the people.\n\nGovernor Bello also spoke about the government\u2019s fight against insecurity and renewed the call for the strict observance of all precautionary measures against the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAccording to him, the security of the state will remain his administration\u2019s major focus in the new year in order to stop banditry and other criminal tendencies towards sustaining the relatively peaceful and harmonious coexistence in the state.\n\nWhile felicitating with the people, the governor praised the gallantry of the military and all security agencies involved in the fight against insecurity and appealed to the people to play their roles to ensure success in the battle against evil.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the new year, we must put the interest of the state over and above other considerations and work towards attaining our collective aspirations,\u201d he said.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nGovernor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, on his part, urged the people of the state to reflect and draw on the lessons learned in the preceding year in all aspects of human endeavours and continue to work for peace and unity, as well as security and development of the state and the country as the new year begins.\n\nHe projected that 2022 will offer the citizenry a new vista and opportunity to renew their faith in God, as he urged them to look to the future with optimism.\n\nThe governor also expressed optimism that the year 2022 would be a bright and prosperous one for both the state and Nigeria.\n\nHe acknowledged the resilience and perseverance of the people of the state in the midst of socio-economic difficulties, insecurity, and the global pandemic of COVID-19 and its consequential effects and asked them to maintain the undying spirit and enter 2022 with hope and renewed faith.\n\nWhile urging the people to continue to live in peace with one another, he assured them of continued support and cooperation with security agencies to combat all forms of criminal activities in the state.\n\nHe congratulated the citizenry for seeing the end of 2021 and stepping into the new year in high spirits and encouraged them to continue to work hard enough and show resilience in order to overcome the challenges and emerge stronger.\n\n\u201cThe year 2022 holds a great promise for all of us through improved security, youths and women empowerment, and greater attention to infrastructure and socio-economic development across all sectors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs we enter the new year, I call on all of us to draw on the lessons learned in 2021 in all aspects of human endeavours and continue to work assiduously for the peace, progress, security, and development of the state.\u201d\n\nSpirit Of Love\n\nIn his New Year message, Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, asked residents to continuously collaborate with security agencies to root out criminals anywhere they are hiding in the state.\n\nHe urged the Presidency and the National Assembly to work together to create an Electoral Act that would make elections in Nigeria transparent and acceptable.\n\nWhile giving security operatives a pat on the back for vehemently fighting crime in the state, the governor urged them to deploy their eagle eyes as political activities take off this year.\n\n\u201cTaraba State has had a very interesting year in 2021 and the good Lord has been able to see us through despite the challenges therein,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, our new year resolution should be to make a solemn pledge to the descent citizens by providing our fair share no matter how small to our beloved state, a better place for everybody which can only be accomplished if we stick to the law and inculcate the spirit of love and togetherness and being our brother\u2019s keeper.\n\n\u201cOur watchword should be security awareness as last year I had the opportunity of donating Toyota Hilux vans to security operatives in order to properly carry out their surveillance of the state. Everybody has a civic duty to cooperate and provide relevant information to security agencies as they have made substantial contributions to the reduction of armed banditry, farmers, herders crisis, tribal feud, kidnapping, and, therefore, needs our cooperation in the run-up to 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ishaku added, \u201cPolitical activities will pick up significantly in 2022, all political parties will hold primaries to select candidates for various political positions and as a result, I employ individuals who intend to run for office to exercise restraint. Let us play the game by the rules so that the will of the people is respected and protected at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI would also like to appeal to religious leaders, traditional rulers, parents and guardians to keep a tight grip on the youth so that they do not become agents of instability in the hands of misguided individuals seeking power at all cost.\u201d\n\nThe governor also assured residents of the state that his administration would continuously provide democratic dividends and complete all existing projects before the conclusion of his tenure next year.\n\nPromise Of Good Governance\n\nSimilarly, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos also with the people of the state a prosperous new year with a promise of good governance.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we draw the curtains on 2021, we should be reminded of life\u2019s lessons. Events that shaped our lives, and experiences that will be entrenched in our memories forever.\n\n\u201cWe must however be thankful for God\u2019s infinite goodness and mercies throughout the past year. Despite the raging pandemic which has crippled many economies, we\u2019re still standing strong and trudging along. Our resilience heightened and our faith unshaken, we made it through 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs your Governor, I salute you all and reassure you of my heart of service and spirit of candour. I will continue to be giving of myself, in spite of misconceptions. I will continue to deliver good governance and provide purposeful leadership to everyone in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe will as a Government, continue to deliver infrastructural developments that will improve the quality of life of residents, such that generations yet unborn will be partakers of the good fortune of Lagos. So, help us God. On behalf of my family and the Government of Lagos State, I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year!\u201d the governor added.\n\nPrayer For Peace\n\nUnlike his counterparts, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State joined the Christian faithful for a special crossover service at the St. Peters Cathedral Church in Ake, Abeokuta.\n\nIn his message, he promised deliberate and purposeful initiatives for economic recovery through his administration\u2019s economic blueprint.\n\nThe governor said efforts would be intensified in the areas of the independent power projects, mass transportation, education, security, critical infrastructure, and healthcare delivery to bring a new lease of life to residents.\n\nWhile asking residents to continue to live together in peace and harmony, he called for more prayers for his administration, the political leaders, and the country in general for peace and development.\n\nReducing Poverty\n\nIn Kwara, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq congratulated the people of the state and Nigerians on the new calendar year.\n\nHe assured residents of his administration\u2019s continuous focus on projects and programmes that would boost inclusive growth, reduce poverty, and create a better environment for sustainable job opportunities in the state.\n\nThe governor explained that the administration\u2019s Budget of Sustained Reformation for Inclusive Growth has been designed to double down on the achievements and reforms in the education sector, healthcare, workers\u2019 welfare, water supply, ease of doing business, a safety net for the poor, access roads within the metropolis and across the state, as well as improved investments and partnership with the security agencies, civic community, and the traditional institutions to guarantee the safety of lives and properties.\n\n\u201cAt the dawn of 2022, I call on our people to continue to support the administration\u2019s policies and programmes to place Kwara on the path of sustainable growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur major selling point has been peace and tranquillity, and I urge that we should continue to relate with one another as one people bound by a common destiny under God. This year, as always, let us watch over one another and work for a greater Kwara and Nigeria, irrespective of our differences.\u201d\n\nThe governors of Edo and Rivers, Godwin Obaseki and Nyesom Wike, also have a series of messages for the people of their states.\n\nMore Opportunities\n\nAs we usher in 2022, let us thank God Almighty that we are able to witness the beginning of another year. In spite of the challenges and uncertainties experienced in 2021, there is a lot which we should be grateful to God Almighty for. Despite witnessing two waves of COVID-19 in 2021, the mortality rate which we recorded in Edo State was far less than was projected. This persisting COVID pandemic is a clarion call for us to pay more attention to our environment and also strengthen our healthcare system. Consequently, the reform of our healthcare system is now a very high priority in our ongoing transformation of the entire governance structure of Edo State. Confident that Edo citizens will continue to subscribe to the Edo Health Insurance Scheme which will provide the long-term funds to sustain our new healthcare system, we are now revamping 100 additional primary healthcare facilities while building our network of specialist hospitals in the three senatorial districts. Our healthcare reform in Edo will also include encouragement of the private sector to invest in providing quality healthcare. We are encouraged with the progress in our transformation of the public service, and we are confident that with the ongoing recruitments, introduction of technology, and the emphasis on training, our citizens will begin to receive better quality services from their government. The construction and rehabilitation of roads are currently going on across the state. Even though the extended rainy season delayed the commencement of work, we are optimistic that significant portions of work will be completed before the next rainy season. We are also focusing on other infrastructure such as electricity and fibre connection. Our operation Light Up Edo is in full gear with the streetlighting project being rolled out in Benin City, Ekpoma, and Auchi. We are working with a private provider to connect all our 18 local government areas with fibre optic connections to enhance access to the internet and expand the digital economy across the state. The physical and digital infrastructure we are laying across the state, including the proposed Airport in Edo North, will position Edo State as a major commercial hub in Nigeria and West Africa. Investing in our people will continue to be a priority in 2022 as we roll out the EdoBEST framework to all tiers of education in the state. We are building shared production facilities in 6 technical colleges across the state to support the technical training of our youths while promoting technical entrepreneurship in these communities. The successful take-off of the Edo Tech Park with the graduation of the first set of highly trained software engineers and developers has spurred us to commence the construction of the permanent site for the Edo Tech Park. We hope the first phase will be ready for use in 2022, thus ensuring Edo\u2019s position as a tech hub on the African continent. In addition to exposing them to technology, we are supporting our youths in entrepreneurship and innovation to seize the moment and build top-of-the-range capacity to compete with their peers globally. We are expending resources to boost opportunities in the creative industry with the establishment of the Victor Uwaifo Creative Hub and Soundstage. As a government, we will continue to deepen our development strides following the gains made in the last five years. Our emphasis will continue to remain on building capacity, deploying technology, promoting innovation, enhancing the growth of the productive sector, and leveraging our Diaspora population to drive sustainable development. In the new year, we are recommitting ourselves to deepen growth across all sectors of the state and providing more opportunities for our people to realise their full potential. These we will do by leveraging the innate abilities of our people and providing them with the tools and enablement to dominate and conquer the world. Let me appreciate and commend the effort and services of all our security agencies particularly our vigilante network who continue to work and sacrifice to keep us safe. Our relative success in securing Edo particularly in the last few months is the result of the collaborative effort of these agencies. Our support will be extended in the new year to the training of our vigilante network in the Nigeria Police Force training facilities in Ogida Barracks which has been refurbished by the Edo State Government. In the areas of agriculture, tourism, infrastructure, energy, electricity, healthcare, education, and security, we are changing the way government works and delivers services to Edo people. As we fulfill this mandate to you, we urge you all to live up to your own civic responsibility by paying your taxes. We are revamping our tax administration system to make it easy for you to pay your taxes with the use of technology. We urge all Edo people to approach the new year with renewed hope in our political system. Our goal is to make sure that in Edo, democracy has full expression and we only vote for candidates with demonstrated evidence to add value to our society. I reassure the good people of Edo State that I will continue to strive to do only that which is in the best interest of Edo State and Edo people. I wish you all a happy and safe 2022. His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki Governor, Edo State\n\nEffective Environmental Sanitation\n\nA STATE-WIDE BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY NYESOM EZENWO WIKE TO MARK THE 2022 NEW YEAR My dear people of Rivers State As the clock ticks down and as we look forward to ushering in the New Year 2022, this is the time to give thanks to the Almighty God for his blessings and the opportunity to look into the future with greater hope and optimism. On behalf of my wife and the Government, let me thank all Rivers State citizens in particular, and Nigerians in general, for your continued love and support to our administration throughout the year 2021. Indeed, we cannot thank you enough for the trust, the solidarity, the cooperation, and above all, your prayers for the success of our government and the peace and progress of our State. We also thank the police, the department of state security, the armed forces, and the paramilitary services for working round the clock to make and keep our dear State peaceful, safe, and secure, not only in this festive season but throughout the outgoing year. Indeed, there is no denying the fact that crime and criminality have been at very low rates in Rivers State and citizens felt safer and more secure in 2021 than in the previous years. With the cooperation of the security agencies, we identified and destroyed most of the shanties that hitherto served as safe havens and hideouts for criminals, who have now been dislodged and dislocated from the State, having lost the space and capacity from which they could operate with ease. To consolidate on the gains of the dislodgement and dislocation exercises, and make the State even safer and more secure, we have decided to demolish all shanties and makeshift structures in identified crime hotspots in Port Harcourt Township and the Illabuchi areas of Diobu from the second week of January 2022. Those rebuilding the shanties we had demolished at Eleme or attempting to resume illegal trading activities at the closed Oginigba slaughter have one week to vacate or be arrested and charged to court. Additionally, we have discovered that most vacant plots or uncompleted buildings in the Old and New Government Reservation Areas (GRA) and some other parts of Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas have been hijacked and are now inhabited by criminal elements who are daily constituting a menace to public safety. We have therefore decided to end this danger by taking over all such abandoned plots and uncompleted buildings and re-allocate them to citizens who are ready to develop and put them into effective occupancy. In a similar vein, we have revoked the certificates of occupancy of several undeveloped plots of land in old GRA, Port Harcourt, for breaching the covenants attached thereto, which we would also re-allocate to interested members of the public for immediate development as part of the ongoing efforts to restore the entire old GRA to its pristine state of development, beauty, and serenity. We will also not spare those contributing to the perennial flooding challenge in parts of Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor Local Government Area by blocking natural water and drainage channels with illegal landfilling, reclamation of wetlands, or the construction of concrete structures. Consequently, we shall recover and restore all landfilled or reclaimed wetlands and demolish all structures erected on natural water channels spanning from the Eastern bypass areas up to Abana and Eleme streets in Old GRA, Port Harcourt. Only those with genuine government permits and allocation papers will be duly compensated. Again, it is important to appreciate what we have done to successfully transform our capital city, Port Harcourt, to one of the most beautiful cities in Nigeria with well-paved streets, pedestrian walkways, dual carriage roads, and flyovers. However, the beauty of the city is being defaced by illegal and indiscriminate trading on our streets, under flyovers, and other unauthorized open spaces as well as the challenges with the current largely inefficient refuse disposal system. I wish to therefore remind citizens that the ban on street trading and commuting on motorcycles in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas is still in force. Consequently, I hereby direct the task force on Illegal Street trading to arrest and prosecute all those: (i) shuttling with their motorcycles and or hawking foreign exchange along Birabi street, Hotel Presidential, GRA junction by Zenith Bank up to Tombia street; and (ii) trading on, under, and around the Rumuola junction and flyover; Rumuogba junction and flyover; as well as Rumuokoro junction and flyover.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Director-General, Tinubu Support Groups Mgt. Council, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has confirmed that former Governor of Lagos State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will indeed be contesting in the forthcoming 2023 Presidential election.\n\n\u201cSometimes I find it a bit funny when I hear people saying is he contesting or not. The only thing that is left is just the formality of organising an event where he is going to express his aspiration, just to notify the public that, yes, I am going to contest. But the issue of Bola Tinubu contesting is a done deal. He is going to contest the election; he\u2019s going to be on the ballot paper,\u201d Jibrin said in an exclusive interview with Channels Television on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat I keep telling people is that, it is one thing to be qualified to be President, it is one thing to be able to make a competent President, and it is another thing to be able to win a presidential election. They are two different things. You have so many people within the APC that are competent and qualified to become President. But it is completely different\u201d.\n\nRead Also: 2023 Presidency: About 2,500 Islamic Clerics Offer Prayers For Tinubu In Kano\n\nAccording to Jibrin, Tinubu has all it takes to defeat any other candidate in the election.\n\n\u201cFor me, the person who has an edge over all of them, that we can hand over the ticket to and perhaps go back home and sleep, is Asiwaju Bola Tinubu,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can assure that if you give people a choice of someone who will come and improve on what we already have on ground and revamp the economy and improve every part of the country \u2013 people just want to see progress, to see development. For me, it doesn\u2019t matter if you bring a Christian-Christian President or a Muslim-Muslim president.\u201d\n\nSpeculations about Tinubu\u2019s ambition to run in the 2023 election is one that has been highly debated over the past year.\n\nWhile he has yet to officially declare his intentions, several political groups have drummed support for him with billboards and posters in some parts of the country, especially major cities \u2013 Lagos and Abuja.\n\nIn December 2021, the APC Chieftain had said he will consult widely before making a decision on whether to run for the Presidency or not.\n\n\u201cI am not going to turn them down,\u201d he said of voices that have clamoured for his candidacy. \u201cBut I will still effectively and widely consult, particularly brainstorm with my friends and find a date to come out openly and tell Nigerians\u201d.\n\nSee Video Below",

          "text": "Face masks are to be worn in secondary classrooms in England\u2019s schools to reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has announced.\n\nThe temporary reintroduction of face coverings aims to address concerns about schools remaining open for face-to-face learning this coming term.\n\nMeanwhile, six school staff unions have issued a demand for urgent action to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThey warned national exams would be put at risk without further measures.\n\nThey also called for air-cleaning units, financial support for absence cover, help with on-site testing and a relaxation of the Ofsted inspection regime.\n\nSchools across the UK are re-opening after the Christmas break over the next week, with pupils being asked to take part in onsite Covid testing.\n\nUntil now, England was the only one of the four UK nations where face masks were not recommended for pupils in classrooms. Teachers will not have to wear them under the new guidelines.\n\nSome individual schools and local authorities in England had already required masks in classrooms.\n\nAnnouncing the change \u2013 just a few days before schools reopen \u2013 Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said face coverings would be required until 26 January.\n\nThis is when the current national Plan B Covid measures run out, although they will be reviewed on or close to 4 January.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to welcoming pupils back next week to continue their face-to-face learning, which is so important for their education and wellbeing.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Omicron variant presents challenges but the entire education sector has responded with a Herculean effort, and for that I thank each and every one of you.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister and I have been clear that education is our number one priority. These measures will bolster our support to schools as we do everything in our power to minimise disruption.\u201d\n\nThe government also announced it would be making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years setting, schools and colleges.\n\nStaff absences and rising Covid rates at the end of last term \u2013 caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant \u2013 have led to fears of further disruption to education.\n\nThe four main teaching unions covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT \u2013 plus the GMB and Unison, have issued a joint statement calling for urgent steps to help schools.\n\n\u201cWe need the minimum amount of educational disruption this term in order to avoid a third successive year where GCSEs, A-levels and other exams have to be cancelled, and thereby removing the uncertainty and additional workload for students and teachers,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cIt is essential, therefore, that the government takes immediate and urgent steps to mitigate the risk of Covid transmission and that it provides more support to minimise disruption in schools and colleges.\u201d\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said while there were obvious drawbacks to using face coverings in classrooms, it was clear that the Omicron variant poses a very significant additional risk.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely essential that everything possible is done to reduce transmission and ensure that children remain in school.\u201d\n\nHe added that the government\u2019s decision on masks was recognition that the spring term will be extremely challenging.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem they face is the likelihood of high levels of staff absence caused by the prevalence of the Omicron variant.\u201d\n\nHe added that while schools and colleges will do their best to minimise the impact on pupils, there was a real possibility that some classes and year groups may have to be sent home for short periods of remote learning.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast that while he did not think \u201canyone will be over the moon\u201d about masks being worn in schools it was better than the children missing out on learning.\n\nMr Streeting said the lack of supply of tests was \u201ccausing real challenges\u201d for parents trying to get their children back to school, for frontline workers and people wanting to go about their daily lives.\n\nHe called for the government to \u201cget a grip\u201d on testing and criticised the government for acting at the \u201c11th hour\u201d as headteachers prepared for the start of term.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers Paul Whiteman said reintroducing face masks in secondary classrooms was a sensible move, but that more should be done.\n\n\u201cWhere schools need air filtration units to improve areas of poor ventilation, they should be provided with them, without delay.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the 7,000 new units but said \u201cadequate ventilation in classrooms should not be limited to first come, first served\u201d.\n\nThe process by which schools can obtain these units is due to be set out by the DfE shortly.\n\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said \u201cfinally, the government has been forced to recognise, and react to, the scale of the Omicron variant and its potential impact on education\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe recommendation on wearing facemasks in secondary school classrooms is overdue \u2013 but it should be a requirement.\u201d\n\nMr Streeting said that the government\u2019s announcement did not go far enough \u2013 suggesting that 7,000 was enough for about one in four schools in England to get one \u2013 and looked \u201cvery much like appearing to be busy days before the start of school term\u201d,",
