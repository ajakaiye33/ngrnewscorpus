I appreciate the concern, but how can we work together and accelerate the programme?\n\n\u201cThe only way is your cooperation with HYPREP; allow it HYPREP to employ the youths of the community as environmental surveillance officers.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with women groups and the youth but we need your cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe want more indigenous people to acquire skills for the clean-up project so that we will not be doing this over and over again,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier, the Paramount Ruler of Tai Kingdom, King Godwin Gininwa, said that even though the HYPREP project was not for only the Ogoni people, Ogoniland should be considered first.\n\n\u201cOur land should be considered first in this project, even before other communities, because our people have suffered so much degradation,\u201d he said.\n\nGininwa urged the Federal Government to work on the proposed University of Environment for Ogoniland in order to assist in educating the people of the community in particular and the state in general.\n\nAlso speaking, the President of Kagote, Bori, Mr Emmanuel Deeyah, said that the community needed to be involved in the implementation of the project so as to aid its effective implementation.\n\nDeeeyah appreciated the minister for visiting the area, adding that this was a demonstration of the government\u2019s concern about the wellbeing of the Ogoni people.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that we are happy and grateful for the visit. We are asking you to please do your possible best to ensure that the HYPREP project has the desired impact on the people of the area.\n\nMeanwhile, during the inspection of the Ogoni clean-up sites, Ikeazor expressed satisfaction with the work done by the contractors.\n\n\u201cThe last time we visited the site, the ground was not fertile; we instructed them to work on the land to ensure that it brings out green grasses.\n\n\u201cToday, I can see that the land is growing weeds. This means that the workers are really complying with the instructions given to them at that time.\n\n\u201cThey should also put more effort to ensure that other areas grow grasses as well,\u201d she said.",

          "title": "Opinion: The Power Equation of Violence",
          "text": ",\n\nGbenro Olajuyigbe\n\nThere must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery- Karl Marx\n\nKarl Marx in his Conflict Theory claimed: \u201csociety is in state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources and that social order is maintained by domination and power\u201d.\n\nHence, social order in any society depends on how power is shared, owned and used. Where power is jointly shared, collectively owned and responsibly used for the happiness of all, gracious social order is likely to be achieved. Where power is privatized, appropriated and irresponsibly used, dislocation and disorder are the imminent consequence.\n\nPower appropriation leads to the ossification of authority; and often, it is at the root of tyranny and oppression. Lawlessness and irresponsibility in society are inherently related to leader\u2019s behaviour and actions. No people obey laws that rulers ignore. Impunity destroys laws, immunity imprisons justice.\n\nAlmost all violence are structurally constituted, systemically driven and humanly perpetrated. Like crime, violence is enabled by opportunity, tools and environment. It does not matter whether the space is private or public, those who control opportunity, have access to tools and create a vulnerable environment are often initiators of violence and crime that people commit.\n\nInjustices and bad governance are the underlying issues of violence in Nigeria; and they are social, political and economic in appearance; with outright criminality and extreme violence as attendant dynamics. Aside from poverty, inequality and injustice that are systemic issues in violent conflict, ethnic and religious identities have assumed lives of their own as critical drivers of violence and arguably, the most manifest gaslighting tools in the hands of political power hustlers.\n\nDesigned and deliberate failure of political leadership to justly manage diversity is a critical concern that has contributed to increasing in vulnerability of communities and people to the extent that protection of people and security of communities are now much more compromised than ever.\n\nHow will there not be violence in a country where abjectly poor hawkers\u2019 subsistent wares are confiscated under lame excuses of constituting a public nuisance, whatever that means. Wherever abodes of the poor are demolished on mere suspicion that they are criminal hideouts, new pools of violence are created.\n\nHow will there not be violence in a nation where access to opportunities is neither open nor equal? How will there be no violence where employment opportunity depends on who you know and not what you know? Any society where houses and structures that support livelihoods are callously demolished without recourse to due diligence and rule of law has given hostage right to violence.\n\nIn 2008, I led and coordinated streams of research work on Oil and Violent Conflicts in the Niger Delta published as a book, \u2018Ablaze for Oil\u2019. The summary was that you cannot de-humanize a people and expect enduring peace. What you invest in the environment is what you get from it. You reap what you sow.\n\nTechnicalities, even in law cannot replace justice, after all, some laws are immoral and they do not serve the cause of justice. Recently, I reflected on the book, \u2018The Closing Chapter\u2019 by Lord Dennings I read in 1991. For those investing technicalities of laws into issues of justice, particularly criminal cases like murder and mass murder, nature has a payback method that is only in the law of retribution.\n\nIt does not require the help of any mortal to perform its duty of dispensation. In the end, only social justice stabilizes society. Harvest cometh.\n\nIt is the collapse of law and leadership in the public space that enabled reckless lawlessness in private space.- defective public structure cannot support private decency. Today, we now have doctors raping their patients, hoteliers killing their guests, students beating their lecturers among others, without consequences in a prostrate society.\n\nA man would marry his seventh wife and some of us will be praising him. Sad we couldn\u2019t see the pattern of the psychological abuse as violence against (other) women he had married in a patriarchal society we live in. I tried capturing how magisterial power opportunism was weaponized as an instrument of oppression and tyranny in my book, \u201cOur Bishop is an Atheist\u201d Our Bishop is an Atheist is an allegory of righteous sermon brewed in cruel heart, the duplicitous character of callous demagogue whose Acts are demagnetized from their words.\n\nIts first chapter is a travelogue. The journey to the habitat of those homo creatures was horrible. The people were ancient in candour, toxic in character, at least to strangers \u2013 a befitting reminiscence of unbelievable cult culture and the unsparing rod of injustice.\n\nCrude powerful predators who weaponized culture and rustic authority and turned them into tools for torture and repression. It is about people of power whose degree of glory depends on the quantum of humiliation others are prepared to bear; testimonial of the inhumanity of man to man and capacity for collective cruelty by atomic custodians of traditional powers. It is the summary of anachronistic reinvention of the dark ages\u2019 atrocities in the era of light and sight.\n\nSafe for Ruka, a pleasant character with the character of care and love, the rustic bared villagers would have been taken as predating homo-Erectus with disdain for civility and humanity. As hard as one would have loved to judge them, we must spare thoughts for the exception, Ruka!\n\nThis fictionalized state of power and society in the book is the reality of our living and practice today. If not, how does one explain the cruelty of having the same person that afflicted you with elephantiasis of poverty in 2021 showing you the 340 per litre grave he has dug for you in 2022 simply because he possesses power, albeit, without purpose!\n\nGbenro Olajuyigbe is the Executive Director of Emergency & Risk Alert Initiative.",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nThe White Paper released by the Lagos State Government on Tuesday floored #EndSARS Panel Report, identifying many inconsistence in the report.\n\nThe government white paper stated that the report listed names of people who died at the Lekki Toll Gate but failed to offer explanation as regards the circumstances of their death.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set on pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, , Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed , at No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petition the Judicial Panel Inquiry in respect of his brother who he allegedly died at Lekki Toll Gate , was also listed dead person\u201d.\n\nThe state government White Paper further posited that, \u2018\u2019This finding of nine (9) deaths at LTG on 20 October is even \u2013 more baffling because apart from listing out their names in that form at pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their death. The names simply sprang up at pages 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, , Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother who he alleged died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020, Remarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No2 on the list of persons who died at LTG.\n\n\u2018\u2019The only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43, on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there-was no-shred of evidence regarding who shot him\u2019\u2019\n\nThe White paper further pointed out that another substantial inconsistency in the JPI Report was the award compensation to only one out of the alleged nine (9), listed as \u201cdeceased\u201d which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the death of eight other allegedly deceased persons on its list.\n\n\u2018\u2019The JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10M to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahi was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 0 the Report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the Panel; neither did she have any claims for compensation. This award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of section 13 Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 La of Lagos State) which prescribes that only witnesses summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at t request or summons of the Tribunal.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe White Paper added that, \u2018\u2019On the basis of the above fundamental inconsistencies in the findings the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG and particularly because the findings are clearly and mainly rot supported by evidence, before the JPI as attested to by the JPI itself, when it said there was no contrary evidence to that of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Government is therefore unable to accept the finding that nine people died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20\u00b0 October 2020.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs it relates to the role played by the military in the saga , the White Paper said that aspect had been referred to the Federal Government\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), has said the review of the 2021 budget has led to the discovery of 257 duplicated projects amounting to N20.138 billion.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nChairman of ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, made the disclosure at the 3rd National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in Public Sector, with the theme: Corruption and Coat of Government New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency, organised by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the ICPC.\n\nHe said the commission also uncover a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service corruptly employ unsuspecting Nigerians, issue them fake letters of employment, fraudulently enroll them on IPPIS and post them to equally unsuspecting MDAs to commence work. He said ICPC was already prosecuting one of the leaders of the syndicate from whose custody led to the retrieval of several fake letters of recommendation purportedly signed by Chief of Staff to the President, Hon Ministers, Federal Civil Service Commission and other high ranking Nigerians.\n\nOwasanoye added that ICPC\u2019s projects tracking covered 1083 projects across entire country with exception of Borno and Zamfara due to security challenges.\n\nHe said the exercise verified implementation of executive and zip projects of legislators. He added that so far action has been initiated against 67 contractors and forced them back to site and ensured completion of 966 projects worth N310 billion some of which were hitherto abandoned.\n\nThe ICPC boss added that there is a mini civil wars going on between the Board and management and sometimes within the board. He added that these squabbles are as a result of abuse of power prohibited by ICPC Act and unreasonable demands by some Board members for privileges contrary to extant circulars and laws and government\u2019s resolve to minimize cost of governance.\n\nThe Owasanoye boss said: \u201cICPC is committed to supporting the programmes and projects of government one of which is restraining the spiraling cost of governance. This is why the theme of this Summit is Corruption and the Cost of Governance: New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency has publicly acknowledged a number of times that your government inherited a number of challenges since 2015 when you assumed office including but not limited to an empty purse and the lack of savings when the economy boomed. A major aspect was the astronomical cost of governance at the federal and sub national levels. This has continued to reflect in the huge wage bill on personnel and operational cost standing at about 70% of annual budget.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency sir, a major push factor on high cost of governance and rising personnel budget is illegal recruitment, illegal and unilateral increase in wages and remuneration by some MDAs, indiscriminate local and international travels, unreasonable demands by some political appointee board members of MDAs without regard for extant circulars on cost management; procurement fraud, budget padding, etc. ICPC investigation of some cases of illegal recruitment forwarded to us by Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has so far implicated Ministry of Labour and the University College Hospital Ibadan and a number of corrupt staff of other MDAs at a lower level. This abuse of power is consummated with complicity of compromised elements in IPPIS. These cases are currently under investigation.\n\n\u201cAt another level, a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service corruptly employ unsuspecting Nigerians, issue them fake letters of employment, fraudulently enroll them on IPPIS and post them to equally unsuspecting MDAs to commence work. ICPC is prosecuting one of the leaders of the syndicate from whose custody we retrieved several fake letters of recommendation purportedly signed by Chief of Staff to the President, Hon Ministers, Federal Civil Service Commission and other high ranking Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSir, the third phase of ICPC\u2019s projects tracking covered 1083 projects across entire country with exception of Borno and Zamfara due to security challenges. The exercise verified implementation of executive and zip projects of legislators. We have so far initiated enforcement actions against 67 contractors and forced them back to site and ensured completion of 966 projects worth N310b some of which were hitherto abandoned.\n\n\u201cOur findings indicate that the same malady of corruption afflicts executive as well as zip projects thus undermining government projections, escalating the cost of governance and denying Nigeria value for money. These malady include poor needs assessment that disconnects projects from beneficiaries; false certification of uncompleted contracts as completed, deliberate under performance of contracts incessant criminal diversion and conversion of public property by civil servants, to name just a few.\n\n\u201cOther challenges relate to duplication of projects in the budget. ICPC review found that 257 projects amounting to N20.138b were duplicated in the 2021 budget leading us to submit an advisory to the HMF which was promptly actioned by the Minister to prevent abuse.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, a number of MDAs have mini civil wars going on between the Board and management and sometimes within the board. These squabbles revolve around abuse of power prohibited by ICPC Act and unreasonable demands by some Board members for privileges contrary to extant circulars and laws and government\u2019s resolve to minimize cost of governance. ICPC\u2019s Ethics Compliance Scorecard of MDAs report for 2021 shows that only 34.6% of the 360 MDAs assessed scored above average in Management Culture and Structure. This poor finding is not unrelated to unstable Boards unable to effectively oversight the institutions.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency sir, let me commend government\u2019s posture against illicit financial flows that drain resources from the nation. The time to further block leakages is now that government revenues are dwindling and practically threatened. ICPC is contributing to government\u2019s efforts by its IFF focused project that has resulted in a major advisory to government with recommendations including prohibiting confidentiality clauses that facilitate fraud and money laundering, prevention of tax evasion, prohibition of illegal tax waivers and all practices that undermine government revenue projections. The IFF Inter-Agency Committee has organized a number of capacity building programs for civil servant on how to avoid fraud and IFF prone agreements.\n\n\u201cOn this note sir, we advise that government invest more in prevention and behaviour change strategies alongside law and order measures to fight corruption. This is important if we are to maximize the gains of prevention and the wisdom that \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d. ICPC in collaboration with development partners notably Ford Foundation for IFFs and MacArthur Foundation for behavior change is putting more attention to these areas in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC boss also presented the winners of the 2021 ICPC Public Service Integrity Awards. They are Mr. Muhammad Tukur Ahmad of NDLEA and Mr. Nelson Orji Okoronkwo of Federal Ministry of Information and Mr. Ikenna Steve Nweke, a Nigerian student in Japan who has been appointed pioneer ICPC Citizen Anti-Corruption Volunteer Group Icon for his exemplary act of integrity of finding and returning intact a wallet containing substantial sums of money despite his impecunious state as a student.\n\nNweke joined the event virtually.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Breaking: Lagos Releases White Paper on Lekki Panel Report",
          "text": "*Rejects finding that nine persons died at Lekki tollgate\n\nBy Segun James\n\nLagos state government has released a White Paper on the Report of the Judicial Panel on police brutality.\n\nThe White Paper released on Tuesday denounced the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on the October 20 Lekki incident where peaceful Protesters were shot by soldiers.\n\nThe state government in its comment vehemently rejected the recommendation, saying it is not acceptable in the sense that it contradicted ,\u2019\u2019The evidence of Pathologist Prof. Obafunwa that only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury and this was not debunked. We deemed it credible as the contrary was not presented before the panel.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Judicial Panel of inquiry had in one of its 32 recommendations in the Lekki Toll Gate Incident recommended , \u2018\u2019 A moment of memorializing the lives lost and those injured at the Lekki Toll Gate with names inscribed on the monument.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe state government White Paper further posited that, \u2018\u2019This finding of nine (9) deaths at LTG on 20\u00b0 October is even \u2013 more baffling because apart from listing out their names in that form at pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their death. The names simply sprang up at pages 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, , Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother who he alleged died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020, Remarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No2 on the list of persons who died at LTG.\n\n\u2018\u2019The only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43, on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there-was no-shred of evidence regarding who shot him\u2019\u2019\n\nThe White paper further pointed out that another substantial inconsistency in the JPI Report was the award of compensation to only one out of the alleged nine (9), listed as \u201cdeceased\u201d which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the death of eight other allegedly deceased persons on its list.\n\n\u2018\u2019The JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10M to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahim was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 of the Report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the Panel; neither did she have any claims for compensation. This award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of section 13 Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 Law of Lagos State) which prescribes that only witnesses summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at the request or summons of the Tribunal.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe White Paper added that, \u2018\u2019On the basis of the above fundamental inconsistencies in the findings the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG and particularly because the findings are clearly and mainly rot supported by evidence, before the JPI as attested to by the JPI itself, when it said there was no contrary evidence to that of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Government is therefore unable to accept the finding that nine people died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20\u00b0 October 2020.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs it relates to the role played by the military , the White Paper said that aspect had been referred to the Federal Government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Accuses labour ministry, UCH of illegal recruitment of staff\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, has disclosed that the Agency has uncovered 257 duplicated projects worth N20.138 billion in the 2021 budget currently being implemented.\n\nHe also accused the Federal Ministry of Labour and the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan and other parastatals of engaging in illegal recruitment of workers.\n\nThe ICPC boss, who spoke Tuesday at the 3rd National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in Public Sector, held at the State House Conference Hall in Abuja, said the Commission\u2019s review of the 2021 budget resulted in the discovery of 257 projects amounting to N20.138 billion being duplicated in the budget \u201cleading us to submit an advisory to the Minister of Finance which was promptly actioned by the Minister to prevent abuse\u201d.\n\nHe further stated that ICPC\u2019s projects tracking covered 1,083 projects across the entire country with the exception of Borno and Zamfara States due to security challenges.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe exercise verified implementation of executive and zip projects of legislators. We have so far initiated enforcement actions against 67 contractors and forced them back to site and ensured completion of 966 projects worth N310 billion some of which were hitherto abandoned.\n\n\u201cOur findings indicate that the same malady of corruption afflicts executive as well as zip projects thus undermining government projections, escalating the cost of governance and denying Nigeria value for money. These maladies include poor needs assessment that disconnects projects from beneficiaries; false certification of uncompleted contracts as completed; deliberate under performance of contracts; incessant criminal diversion and conversion of public property by civil servants, to name just a few.\u201d\n\nOwasanoye listed the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment and UCH, Ibadan, among government establishments implicated in cases of illegal recruitment being investigated by the ICPC.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the summit: \u2018Corruption and Cost of Governance: New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency\u2019, the ICPC chairman disclosed that the cost of governance in the country has perpetually been pushed up by corrupt practices, including illegal recruitments, unilateral and illegal increase of salaries and wages, procurement malpractices and budget padding by some government establishments.\n\nAccording to him, the commission also uncovered a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service, corruptly employing unsuspecting Nigerians, issue them fake letters of employment, fraudulently enroll them on IPPIS and post them to equally unsuspecting MDAs to commence work.\n\nHe said ICPC was already prosecuting one of the leaders of the syndicate from whose custody led to the retrieval of several fake letters of recommendation purportedly signed by the Chief of Staff to the President, ministers, Federal Civil Service Commission and other high-ranking Nigerians.\n\nOwasanoye added that ICPC\u2019s projects tracking covered 1,083 projects across the entire country with exception of Borno and Zamfara due to security challenges.\n\nHe said the exercise verified the implementation of executive and zip projects of legislators, adding that so far, action has been initiated against 67 contractors and forced them back to site and ensured completion of 966 projects worth N310 billion some of which were hitherto abandoned.\n\nHe said: \u201cICPC is committed to supporting the programmes and projects of government one of which is restraining the spiraling cost of governance. This is why the theme of this Summit is Corruption and the Cost of Governance: New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency has publicly acknowledged a number of times that your government inherited a number of challenges since 2015 when you assumed office including but not limited to an empty purse and the lack of savings when the economy boomed. A major aspect was the astronomical cost of governance at the federal and sub national levels. This has continued to reflect in the huge wage bill on personnel and operational cost standing at about 70% of annual budget.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency sir, a major push factor on high cost of governance and rising personnel budget is illegal recruitment, illegal and unilateral increase in wages and remuneration by some MDAs, indiscriminate local and international travels, unreasonable demands by some political appointee board members of MDAs without regard for extant circulars on cost management; procurement fraud, budget padding, etc.\n\n\u201cICPC investigation of some cases of illegal recruitment forwarded to us by Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has so far implicated Ministry of Labour and the University College Hospital, Ibadan and a number of corrupt staff of other MDAs at a lower level. This abuse of power is consummated with complicity of compromised elements in IPPIS. These cases are currently under investigation.\n\n\u201cAt another level, a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service corruptly employ unsuspecting Nigerians, issue them fake letters of employment, fraudulently enroll them on IPPIS and post them to equally unsuspecting MDAs to commence work. ICPC is prosecuting one of the leaders of the syndicate from whose custody we retrieved several fake letters of recommendation purportedly signed by Chief of Staff to the President, Hon Ministers, Federal Civil Service Commission and other high ranking Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOwasanoye further revealed that the harmonies between boards and managements of some establishments had been disrupted because of disagreements bordering on abuse of power and other malpractices.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, a number of MDAs have mini civil wars going on between the Board and management and sometimes within the board. These squabbles revolve around abuse of power prohibited by ICPC Act and unreasonable demands by some Board members for privileges contrary to extant circulars and laws and government\u2019s resolve to minimize cost of governance.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency sir, let me commend government\u2019s posture against illicit financial flows that drain resources from the nation. The time to further block leakages is now that government revenues are dwindling and practically threatened.\n\n\u201cICPC is contributing to government\u2019s efforts by its IFF focused project that has resulted in a major advisory to government with recommendations including prohibiting confidentiality clauses that facilitate fraud and money laundering, prevention of tax evasion, prohibition of illegal tax waivers and all practices that undermine government revenue projections,\u201d he said.\n\nReeling out facts and figures of the Commission\u2019s Ethics Compliance Scorecard of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), Owasanoye said only 34.6% of the 360 establishments scored above the average mark.\n\n\u201cICPC\u2019s Ethics Compliance Scorecard of MDAs report for 2021 shows that only 34.6% of the 360 MDAs assessed scored above average in Management Culture and Structure. This poor finding is not unrelated to unstable Boards unable to effectively oversight the institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Mandates committee to probe incidents\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday resolved to summon the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola; the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and the Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, over the recurring incidents of jailbreaks in different parts of the country.\n\nIt also mandated its Committee on Interior to carry out a full scale investigation into the causes of jailbreaks in some correctional centres across the country.\n\nThe invitation of the two ministers and DG of NCS by the Red Chamber is also aimed at determining the status of correctional centres nationwide, with a view to finding out the challenges in order to prevent future jailbreaks.\n\nThese formed part of the resolutions reached by the Senate following a motion brought during plenary by Senator Istifanus Gyang.\n\nThe motion was titled \u2018Terror Attacks on two Communities in Plateau North and Jail Break at the Jos Medium Security Correctional Centre Jos.\u2019\n\nGyang, while coming under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules to present his motion, noted with grief the multiple terror attacks on two communities of Ta\u2019egbe, Rigwe land and Durbi, Sheri District in Bassa and Jos East Local Governments, leading to the death of over 10 persons last weekend.\n\nAccording to him, the attacks caused by a security breach of the Jos Medium Security Correctional Centre was a setback to the relative and much desired peace in Plateau North.\n\nHe disclosed that nine inmates, including an officer identified as Umar A. Mohammed, were also killed, while 252 inmates escaped during the jailbreak, adding that among the inmates at large, six were fatally injured, 10 of the escapees re-arrested, 63 sentenced to death, 27 convicted and 181 awaiting trials.\n\nGyang said that the invaders responsible for the jailbreak \u201cwalked through a security zone and broke through to have over 200 inmates escape from the centre\u201d.\n\nHe added that the wardens, who put up a fight against the invaders, were overwhelmed during a gun battle against the attackers.\n\nContributing, Senator Ahmad Babba Kaita blamed the spate of insecurity in Nigeria on the inadequate number of personnel across the various security agencies in the country.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the National Assembly to rise to the occasion by appropriating more funds to security agencies to enable them undertake recruitment of more personnel.\n\nOn his part, the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, attributed the recent jailbreak in the country to what he described as a \u201cporous prisons system\u201d.\n\nHe lamented that jailbreaks have become a recurring decimal which, in recent times, have exposed the lives of Nigerians to harm, as a result of prisoners on the rampage to avenge their conviction.\n\nAlso speaking, the Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, described the string of jailbreaks across the country as \u201cunfortunate\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the development, which must be tackled headlong, was a fallout of correctional services being the weakest link in Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system.\n\nThe Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, who presided over plenary, described the security breaches at correctional facilities as a \u201cserious issue\u201d that must be looked into.\n\nOmo-Agege also canvassed for more funding to the office of the National Security Adviser to facilitate intelligence gathering.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving given all the requisite funding to the security agencies, why are we still having these challenges? I think it is something we need to sleep over.\n\n\u201cBut in the interim, it is clear that we have a serious intelligence gathering gap, there\u2019s no debate about that.\n\n\u201cI think the Department of State Services (DSS) and most especially the office of the NSA, have not been given the kind of funding that is required for this fight, because they are the ones that are in charge of intelligence gathering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always taken the position that the office of the NSA, most especially, has been underfunded.\n\n\u201cHe is supposed to be the one coordinating intelligence gathering and providing such intelligence to the other agencies for them to give requisite protection.\n\n\u201cIf the office of the NSA is not properly funded, then of course it means that we are all in trouble.\n\n\u201cI think this is something that we must appeal to Mr. President, and even here in the leadership of the National Assembly, to look into for additional funding for the office of the NSA and, possibly, that of the DSS before the budget is finally tabled for consideration.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate in its resolutions called for a reinforcement of physical protection system and mechanism at correctional centres across the nation by the Ministry of Interior to forestall further attempts at jailbreaks.\n\nIt maintained that the attacks on Ta\u2019egbe and Durbi communities in Plateau North and other communities across the nation requires more decisive and proactive measures by the Chief of Defence Staff and the Inspector General of Police, to secure law abiding citizens from incessant terror attacks, particularly now that the long awaited proscription of bandits as terrorists has been formalized by the federal government.\n\nThe Red Chamber also commended the Judiciary for the recent judgment by the Federal High Court declaring all bandits and insurgents as terrorists, adding that doing so has empowered the military to take appropriate action against them.\n\nIt also mandated its Committee on Interior to invite the Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, the AGF, Malami, and Comptroller General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Nababa, in order to carry out full scale investigation of the status of correctional centres nationwide, with a view to finding out the challenges to prevent future recurrence of jailbreaks.\n\nThe Senate, thereafter, observed a minute silence in prayers for the victims from Ta\u2019egbe and Durbi communities, who lost their lives during attacks on the Jos Correctional Centre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The perpetrators must be prosecuted. The only healing to ensure that those killers paid the price of killings. Lai Muhammad must apologise for his statement on the report. Victims must be compensated. That is the only healing. \u2014 Focus 24/7 (@FalolaSegun11) November 30, 2021\n\nSanwoolu na joke. Lagosians are not stupid. He has invited Segun Sega Awosanya and Dele Farotimi for a peace walk after he committed a crime of murder. Why didn't he invite the grieving parents to come and walk with those who killed their children? Dude is a joker. \u2014 Oluyinka Oyeniji (@YinkaOyeniji) November 30, 2021\n\nSanwoolu na joke.

          "text": "A recent report from Unwanted Witness, a Uganda-based civil society organisation, reveals that two years on from the implementation of Uganda\u2019s Data Protection and Privacy Act, the nation\u2019s tech companies are still struggling with compliance.\n\nTelecommunication operators are at the core of Uganda\u2019s digital development, and yet are among the worst offenders on privacy violations, raising questions about their ability to protect sensitive user data.\n\nLaw in action\n\nUganda implemented its first codified legislation on data protection, the Data Protection, and Privacy Act, in 2019. The act, which establishes principles surrounding the protection, collection, and storage of customers\u2019 personal data, designates the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) as the official regulator for data protection in the country and lays out penalties for violators.\n\nSince its implementation, Uganda\u2019s core data privacy act has proven to be an effective regulator, to some extent.\n\nIn 2020, Unwanted Witness investigated motorcycle ride-hailing startup Safeboda\u2019s compliance with data privacy regulations in the country. Their findings revealed that the company was not only guilty of using a privacy policy that did not comply with Uganda\u2019s data protection standards but also using a third-party tracker called CleverTap. When asked about its use of CleverTap, Safeboda\u2019s Chief Financial Officer claimed it was for \u201ctracking marketing communication and identifying product issues\u201d.\n\nThough no punitive measures were taken against Safeboda, the NITA-U did publish a report on its own investigation into the company\u2019s practices in early 2021. The regulator concluded that Safeboda was, in fact, in violation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and ordered the company to address \u201call areas of non-compliance\u201d over a four-month period.\n\nTelecom offenders\n\nWhile the work of Unwanted Witness and Uganda\u2019s Data Privacy Act helped stop some of Safeboda\u2019s practices, Uganda\u2019s telecommunication operators are still among the worst offenders.\n\nThe Privacy Scorecard Report 2021 revealed that telecom operators in Uganda failed to give adequate information to data subjects, mention third-party sharing of personal data, and give information on the quantity of information shared.\n\nThis resulted in a low overall score of 35% for the industry when it came to data compliance.\n\nThese digital failures have real-life consequences.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Mukasa, CEO at Unwanted Witness, \u201cTelecom companies are the highest data collectors [in Uganda]\u201d, and they are still struggling to ensure that they protect individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in an environment where telecom companies occupy a fundamental position in a nation\u2019s economy and tech industry.\n\nThe number of mobile subscribers in Uganda is rapidly on the rise, increasing by 21,200% from 2000\u20132020. As mobile subscriptions have grown, telcos in Uganda have also received new access to personal information from Ugandan citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) issued new SIM card validation guidelines that required telcos to verify a registered mobile number against a citizen\u2019s National Identification Number (NIN). The regulation was meant to tackle fraud and crime, but, in the hands of telcos with suboptimal data privacy frameworks, it offered new capabilities for exploitation.\n\nHacking\n\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the use of mobile money\u2014of which MTN and Airtel Uganda maintain a 90% share of the market\u2014has increased by around 12.7%.\n\nAlongside this jump in users has also been more frequent instances of cyber fraud aimed at telecom companies, revealing just how essential proper data management and protection is.\n\nA 2019 Uganda Police Annual Crime Report revealed a 25% increase in cybercrime over a one-year period, leading to a loss of around $11 million from SIM card swapping and hacking digital financial accounts.\n\nIn 2020, MTN and Airtel Uganda were forced to temporarily suspend mobile money operations after their systems were compromised by hackers. Unconfirmed reports estimate that billions of Ugandan shillings were lost in the breach.\n\nWhy tech offends\n\nBeyond the value that an application garners from its products and services is the data it collects. Generally, a tech company, in its early stages, is not profitable in the traditional sense. At this point, its value is, in part, based on the data the company has access to through its user base.\n\nOften, as in the case of Safeboda, tech companies add trackers and third-party software on top of their applications to process the data they collect. Updating users each and every time a company adds a new tracker and explaining exactly what that tracker does can be bad for business.\n\nWhen Apple rolled out a new update allowing customers to opt-out of data trackers used by social media platforms earlier this year, digital citizens leaped at the opportunity, resulting in an estimated loss of $9.85 billion in revenue by Snap, Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, the tech companies that operate there gather data on a traditionally underserved tech market where there is \u201clow awareness of the power that they have to change and control their personal data,\u201d according to Mukasa.\n\nThis leaves Uganda\u2019s digital citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous tech companies who \u201care exploiting the low levels of awareness among the population to be able to collect as much as they can,\u201d said Mukasa.\n\nCountries around the world whose tech industries developed faster than regulation could keep up with had to learn hard lessons about digital privacy.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) has embarked on a year-long campaign to rein in powerful tech companies the government feels have had unchecked access to user data for far too long.\n\nFacebook has also been in and out of courts in the US and UK over data privacy issues, since 2018.\n\nAs Uganda\u2019s tech industry continues to develop, it too will have to contend with the benefits and costs of tech development.\n\nWhile this is going on, monitoring and evaluation by independent, civil society organisations like Unwanted Witness will become more important than ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Bolt partners with MAX to expand its vehicle finance scheme in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArt is evolving. Before now, art could only depict meaning in the real world \u2014 an image of a known person or a familiar sunset over a known hill. The idea of drawing, moulding or sculpting something that didn\u2019t or had never existed before was inconceivable.\n\nBy 1915, Kazimir Malevich, a Russian artist, proved art could be anything through his painting \u2014 a black square. With Malevich\u2019s work, art transcended from being a form of representation to a form of expression.\n\nPresently, evolution has brought art to an age where it is intangible yet valuable.\n\nAn idea of what NFTs are\n\nInherently, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital art that have been given a unique identity on the blockchain. See them as a digital certificate that shows the original owner of something even though there are several copies of that same thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re called non-fungible because, unlike fungible tokens, they\u2019re unique and cannot be replicated.\n\nA fungible token, for instance, is Bitcoin (BTC). That\u2019s because one BTC in my wallet is the same as one BTC in someone else\u2019s wallet, and if we exchange it, we still have the same thing.\n\nBut, if we own Anthony Azekwoh\u2019s Red Man NFT and someone else owns an NFT by another artist, we will have completely different things if we exchange it. Hence, non-fungible.\n\nInterestingly, NFTs could be anything; art, picture, video, or music.\n\nNFTs got popular with the birth of CryptoKitties \u2014 digital cats \u2014 which sold for as much as $110,707 in December 2017. However, the first-ever NFT is known as Quantum, minted on the Ethereum network in 2014.\n\nNFTs are stored on the blockchain like other cryptocurrencies but with a different token standard that contains additional information.\n\nIn straightforward terms, a token standard contains a set of information that tells which blockchain network a token belongs to. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, the common token standard for a fungible token is ERC-20, while for NFTs, it is ERC-721.\n\nHowever, knowing all that technical jargon isn\u2019t so important in creating and selling your own NFT. By now, it is clear that apart from a platform to display creativity; it is also a money-making stream. Beautiful times, we must say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe age of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nIt\u2019s the age where Anthony Azekwoh, a 21-year old NFT artist, is making a fortune from creating digital art such as his famous Red Man or historical Black Samurai.\n\nThis new dispensation presents an opportunity for people to showcase their artistic expressions and get appreciated immediately.\n\nWith over $10 billion exchanging hands in the NFT market this year alone, the era of digital art is starting to become one many do not want to miss out on.\n\nHowever, like most blockchain innovations, getting into NFTs can be complicated for newbies in the blockchain universe.\n\nGetting into NFTs isn\u2019t so complicated. All that\u2019s needed is to have the necessary tools to build your experience in the field.\n\nLet us walk you through the process\n\n\n\nThis is a Techpoint Extra article, reserved for readers in our Membership Programme.

Square CEO\n\nThis week definitely started with a surprise. Jack Dorsey is no longer Twitter CEO, a company he co-founded in 2006 and has held a role in for 15 years. He is now replaced by the CTO, Parag Agrawal (pictured in featured image).\n\nIn the meantime, he\u2019ll remain on the social networking platform\u2019s board until the second quarter of 2022, when his tenure ends and to also aid a proper transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack tweeted a screenshot of his email to the Twitter team to make the resignation public. He believes it was finally time for him to leave for three reasons \u2014 he has the perfect replacement, has gotten Bret Taylor to become board chair, and finally to pass a message to the Twitter team that every one of them has the potential to lead.\n\nHowever, there are claims that the resignation was necessary as he could no longer continue to head Twitter along with his digital payments company, Square, due to criticisms \u2014 or concerns \u2014 that he might not perform optimally from some stakeholders.\n\nInterestingly, Jack has been running Square since 2009, after he was deemed unfit by stakeholders in 2008 and forced out of the Twitter CEO role. Fast forward to 2015; it was a unanimous decision from investors of both Twitter and Square to make him a permanent CEO.\n\nLong time coming? There have always been suggestions that he might be forced to leave one of the companies for another.\n\nFun fact: Based on 2020 values, Jack owns 2% of Twitter, making up $849M of his $12,3B total net worth.\n\nAway from Jack, there\u2019s a kind of excitement that came with this announcement. Parag is yet another top executive of Indian descent (the youngest on the list) leading a global tech company. A few mentions include Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, IBM\u2019s Arvind Krishna, Adobe\u2019s Shantanu Narayen, and Ajaypal Singh Banga of Mastercard.\n\nAnother fun fact: Parag Agrawal was among 4 Twitter executives who visited Nigeria with Jack Dorsey in 2019. An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and Stanford University, Parag was instrumental in Twitter\u2019s foray into AI and Machine Learning. Learn more about him here.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify NFTs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney vector created by freepik\n\nPeople are making a killing from non-fungible tokens (NFTs), from $2 billion worth of trades in the first quarter of 2021 to $10 billion by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, not everyone knows how to get in on the NFT action. It is one of the many innovations in the blockchain space that only enthusiasts and experts can easily take advantage of.\n\nWhile the news about NFT sales worth millions of dollars keeps making the rounds on social media, many of us still do not know what NFTs are.\n\nIn the simplest form, NFTs are just like a digital certificate of ownership. But why are they worth so much, and how does one create them?\n\nTo find out, look out for Bolu Abiodun\u2019s article on how to get started with NFTs later today.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nAre Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?

And with companies like MaxAB, Sokowatch, and Sabi playing in the space, it does look like one to watch.\n\nNigeria\u2019s cooking gas woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are like me and have contemplated using firewood as an alternative to cooking gas in the last few weeks, then some of these statistics might not surprise you.\n\nIn October 2021, the average price of 12.5kg cooking gas in Nigeria increased by 62.76% compared to October 2020. Between August 2021 and October 2021, the price increased by 47%.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo State has the highest average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021.\n\nThe graph above shows the increase in the price of cooking gas since November 2019.\n\nTo see the top ten states by average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021, kindly follow this link.\n\nThis is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here\n\nAfrica-focused Sanicle raises $160k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanicle\u2019s website\n\nLast week, women-focused startup, Sanicle (Padbanque) received an impact investment of $160,000 from Platform Capital,\n\nCo-founded by Chaste Inegbedion (Chief Period Officer), Roxanne Stewart (CEO), and Sage Oni (CTO), Sanicle officially launched in January 2021 with a plan to demystify periods by promoting period literacy while destigmatising women in menstruation.\n\nIts primary offerings, however, include a period box, a book, and a board game called Period Genie. The Period Box, which contains period essentials, and the book (Period Passport) authored by one of the co-founders are available on the business\u2019 eCommerce platform, sanicle.shop.\n\nThe impact fund, as the CPO revealed, would be deployed to make the eCommerce platform more robust and evolve the game to become a community to period management.\n\nWith more technology positioned towards period tracking, Sanicle\u2019s end game is to make period literacy mainstream to all genders, and not only women.\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t see this\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nFound this gem of an artiste, thanks to a friend this weekend.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nFormer chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega has warned that Nigeria is dancing on the precipice and may collapse if not restructured sooner than later.\n\nJega who described Nigeria\u2019s federal system as the worst among contemporary federations, noted that the federation lacks the key principle of a federal system, which according to him, is unity in diversity.\n\nThe former INEC chairman who made the remarks while delivering a lecture at the 7th Goddy Jidenma Foundation Public Lecture on Tuesday at the Muson Centre, Lagos, also decried the growing insecurity in the country, noting that Nigeria is a rapidly failing state which could become a failed state if urgent steps were not taken to reverse the trend.\n\nHe noted that increasingly Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity is being challenged, and as today, government no longer has control of large swaths of the country\u2019s territorial space, which according to him, could continue to get worse.\n\nJega noted that the current security architecture was incapable of of tackling the country\u2019s security challenges, and called for immediate establishment of state police.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNo reasonable person should oppose state police in Nigeria today.\u201d\n\nJega also berated the government of President Muhammadu Buhari for, according to him, mismanaging the country\u2019s diversity, noting that the country is today more divided than ever, but cautioned against any potential attempt by his successor to emulate him, which could them drive the country into a vicious cycle of nepotism.\n\nThe former INEC boss who presided over the country\u2019s general elections in 2011 and 2015, equally noted that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is becoming increasingly dictatorial, while calling on the populace to wake up and get involved in governance.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must use democracy not just a basis for attaining good governance, but also as a basis for ensuring that whatever governance process, we are following democratic norms.\n\n\u201cThis is very important because when we review Nigeria\u2019s situation, while we think we are democratising, and while we may be happy that we have 21 years uninterrupted elections, our democratic culture is being eroded and we are confronted with the threat of authoritarian reversal.\u201d\n\nJega who regretted that the country\u2019s democracy is still dominated by military officers, called for a paradigm shift, while rallying Nigerians to get involved in the democratic process.\n\nHe said the country needed a third force, as according to him, the two dominant political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressive Congress have shown that they are incapable of providing leadership for the country.\n\nCommending the Goddy Jidenma Foundation for organising the lecture, Jega described the late Goddy Jidenma in whose honour the foundation was founded as a worthy Nigerian who contributed his energy and intellect to national development.\n\nIn her own remarks, Dr. Nike Akande, former Minister of Industry who chaired the event, said the late Jidenma contributed immensely to national development, especially during his tenure as a commissioner in Anambra State.\n\nAlso speaking, Prof Pat Utomi, Chairman of the Foundation\u2019s Board described the late Jidenma as a committed Nigerian who was passionate about improving society.\n\nHe paid tribute to his wife, Dr. Ije Jidenma whom he described as an extraordinary person who has never give up spirit.\n\nIn her own remarks, Dr. Ije Jidenma, founder of Goddy Jidenma Foundation, called on all well meaning Nigerians to rise to the challenge of rescuing the country from the brink.\n\nShe said insecurity has become part of daily life in the country, which must not be allowed to continue.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Uchenna Cyril Anioke, President of Nigerian Publishers Association; Dare Oluwatuyi; President of Booksellers Association of Nigeria; Dr Nkem Osuigwe, of the African Libraries and Information Associations and Institutions and Mr. Richard Mammah, President of Network of Book Clubs and Reading Promoters in Nigeria, also tasked industry players to be fully ready to raise their voices and make their activities more visible for all to see through enhanced public awareness and sensitization.\n\nThey also decided that it had become necessary to remind government of its role in the continued nurturing and development of the book sector, \u201cbeginning with the coming into effect of a National Book Policy within the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nAlso among the resolutions reached at the end of the session was to encourage the attachment of functional and viable book clubs to all libraries in the country, and to encourage governments across board, and particularly at the local government area level, to establish, maintain, staff and furnish at least one community library per LGA, whose book stock must be renewed and updated annually.\n\nThe stakeholders noted that going forward, \u201clibraries should be seen and regarded as more than \u2018houses of books,\u2019 but even more appropriately as \u2018living community houses and centres of ideas and culture\u2019 where unfettered dissemination and transmission of information is maximally encouraged and takes place.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, government, as well as stakeholders in the book trade, should pay even greater regard to factors of ease of availability and affordability of books as a way of engendering improved readership patronage.\n\n\u201cThat in a practical sense, stakeholders should do more to facilitate the coming into being of at least one \u2018National Books Distribution Company\u2019 as a practical vehicle for lowering distribution and marketing costs within the next three years,\u201d the communique read.\n\n\u201cThat Publishers must take advantage of the Information Technology tools prevalent amongst the youths nowadays, to package their contents for readers across various formats (audio books, e-book, V-book, braille etc) to encourage and promote reading amongst the youths\n\n\u201cThat the respective associations in the book trade should continue with their ongoing engagements in respect of the restoration of the traditional book chain and invest more resources in order that we may be able to better guarantee the immediate and long-term sustainability of the books ecosystem in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders were drawn from, among others, the Committee for Relevant Art, the Nigerian Book Fair Trust, the Nigerian Publishers Association, the Booksellers Association of Nigeria, the African Library and Information Associations and Institutions, and the Network of Book Clubs and Reading Promoters in Nigeria.\n\nThe session themed \u2018Getting books to readers across the country and the Role of Library and Resource Centres in Getting Books to Readers,\u2019 witnessed presentations by Mr. Dare Oluwatuyi, Chief (Hon.)

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nCongo and Nigeria were worst hit as rate of organised crime increased across Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows no signs of slowing, according to the 2021 Organised Crime Index released on 25 November.\n\nIt is one of Africa\u2019s biggest security challenges, with more than two-thirds of Africans living in countries with high criminality, and nearly 80% in states with acute vulnerability and low resilience.\n\nOrganised crime, the report said, got worse in 42 countries on the continent and improved in just 12 between 2019 and 2021. Africa has the second-highest levels of criminality globally, after Asia.\n\nOrganised crime causes vast social, economic, political and environmental damage; from human trafficking for sexual exploitation to corruption, fraud and money laundering, and poaching of endangered wildlife.\n\nThe report said organised crime threatens peace and security on the continent, in a vicious and self-perpetuating cycle, damaging governance and eroding the rule of law.\n\nAccording to it, Africa experiences an annual loss of US$88.6 billion in illicit financial flows linked to criminal activities. This is equivalent to 3.7% of the continent\u2019s GDP, according to UNCTAD\u2019s Economic Development in Africa Report 2020.\n\nThe Organised Crime Index is published by the European Union-funded ENACT programme (Enhancing Africa\u2019s Response to Transnational Organised Crime) \u2013 run by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), INTERPOL and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n\n\u201cThe wheels of the criminal ecosystem kept turning during COVID-19,\u201d says Mark Shaw, Director of GI-TOC. \u201cOur 2019 Index reported widespread organised crime with no region spared the damage inflicted by illicit economies. In 2021 our data suggests it is worse, with more criminality and less resilience.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has the highest criminality, followed by Nigeria, while Kenya, South Africa, Libya and Mozambique are also in the top 10.\n\n\u201cOrganised criminals took advantage of the pandemic to fill gaps left by state institutions and adapt illicit activities to beat COVID-19 restrictions. Institutional responses to stop the virus caused extensive losses for legitimate businesses and, despite lockdowns and restrictions on movement, organised criminals were able to adapt more effectively than legal entities,\u201d the report said\n\n\u201cState-embedded actors grew more powerful as they monetised their control over government resources and institutions. The pandemic may also have provided opportunities for states to crack down on critical voices under the pretext of promoting health and curbing the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cHuman trafficking remained the most pervasive criminal market in Africa, while the cocaine trade saw the biggest increase.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that Central Africa registered the largest rise in criminality, and East Africa remains the region in which organised crime is most prevalent.\n\nIllicit economies, from drug markets to illegal mining and weapons smuggling are drivers of conflict and instability; and conflict zones and fragile states create conditions where organised crime can flourish.\n\n\u2018\u2018Criminal economies often intertwine themselves with formal economies and market institutions of countries experiencing violence, terrorism, insurgency and war. Instability caused by conflict is a significant impediment to an effective government response to organised crime,\u201d said Martin Ewi, Coordinator of the Southern African organised crime observatory for the ENACT programme.\n\nThe 2021 assessment shows that countries scoring highest for organised crime often experience conflict or some form of violence, insurrection, terrorist activity or civil unrest. Conflict also diverts important resources, thereby undermining institutions responsible for taking steps to contain organised crime.\n\nENACT researchers found some positive change between 2019 and 2021, with marginally more resilience driven by social protection measures such as victim and witness support.\n\nBut a major injection of political will is required to tackle organised crime in Africa. Economic opportunities and development, and improved regulatory environments, will reduce incentives to engage in illicit behaviour, ENACT researchers said.\n\nThe index also proposed capacity building across justice and security structures, with greater support for social protection and civil society to strengthen national resilience.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The White Paper released by Lagos State government on Tuesday night has denounced the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry into police brutality especially on the alleged Lekki Tollgate killings of October 20, 2020.\n\nThe Judicial Panel of Inquiry had in one of its 32 recommendations on the Lekki Tollgate incident, recommended \u201cA moment of memorialising the lives lost and those injured at the Lekki Toll Gate with names inscribed on the monument.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the state government in its white paper vehemently rejected the recommendation, saying it was not acceptable in the sense that it contradicted \u201cThe evidence of Pathologist Prof. Obafunwa that only three of the bodies that the conducted post mortem examination on were from Lekki and only one had gun shot injury and this was not debunked. We deemed it credible as the contrary was not presented before the panel.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe state government White Paper further posited that, \u201cThis finding of nine (9) deaths at LTG on 20 October is even more baffling because apart from listing out their names in that form at pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their death. The names simply sprang up at pages 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother who he allegedly died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020. Remarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No2 on the list of persons who died at LTG.\n\n\u201cThe only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43 on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there was no shred of evidence regarding who shot him.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe wwhite paper further pointed out that another substantial inconsistency in the JPI report was the award of compensation to only one out of the alleged nine listed as \u201cdeceased\u201d which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the death of eight other allegedly deceased persons on its list.\n\n\u2018\u2019The JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10m to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahim was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 of the Report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the Panel; neither did she have any claims for compensation. This award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of section 13 Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 La of Lagos State) which prescribes that only witnesses summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at t request or summons of the Tribunal.\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe White Paper added that, \u2018\u2019On the basis of the above fundamental inconsistencies in the findings the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG and particularly because the findings are clearly and mainly rot supported by evidence, before the JPI as attested to by the JPI itself, when it said there was no contrary evidence to that of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Government is therefore unable to accept the finding that nine people died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20\u00b0 October 2020.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs regards to the role played by the military in the saga, the government White Paper said the aspect had been referred to the Federal Government.",

          "title": "Govt White Paper Rubbishes Lagos #EndSARS Panel Report On Lekki Killings",
          "text": "The White Paper released by Lagos State government on Tuesday night has denounced the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry into police brutality especially on the alleged Lekki Tollgate killings of October 20, 2020.\n\nThe Judicial Panel of Inquiry had in one of its 32 recommendations on the Lekki Tollgate incident, recommended \u201cA moment of memorialising the lives lost and those injured at the Lekki Toll Gate with names inscribed on the monument.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the state government in its white paper vehemently rejected the recommendation, saying it was not acceptable in the sense that it contradicted \u201cThe evidence of Pathologist Prof. Obafunwa that only three of the bodies that the conducted post mortem examination on were from Lekki and only one had gun shot injury and this was not debunked. We deemed it credible as the contrary was not presented before the panel.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe state government White Paper further posited that, \u201cThis finding of nine (9) deaths at LTG on 20 October is even more baffling because apart from listing out their names in that form at pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their death. The names simply sprang up at pages 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother who he allegedly died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020. Remarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No2 on the list of persons who died at LTG.\n\n\u201cThe only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43 on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there was no shred of evidence regarding who shot him.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe wwhite paper further pointed out that another substantial inconsistency in the JPI report was the award of compensation to only one out of the alleged nine listed as \u201cdeceased\u201d which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the death of eight other allegedly deceased persons on its list.\n\n\u2018\u2019The JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10m to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahim was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 of the Report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the Panel; neither did she have any claims for compensation. This award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of section 13 Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 La of Lagos State) which prescribes that only witnesses summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at t request or summons of the Tribunal.\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe White Paper added that, \u2018\u2019On the basis of the above fundamental inconsistencies in the findings the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG and particularly because the findings are clearly and mainly rot supported by evidence, before the JPI as attested to by the JPI itself, when it said there was no contrary evidence to that of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Government is therefore unable to accept the finding that nine people died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20\u00b0 October 2020.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs regards to the role played by the military in the saga, the government White Paper said the aspect had been referred to the Federal Government.",

          "title": "Lagos White Paper rubbishes #EndSARS Panel report of massacre at Lekki Tollgate",
          "text": "Lagos State Government\u2019s White Paper has rubbished the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) report of massacre at the Lekki Tollgate, saying the report is full of inconsistencies and contradictions.\n\nThe White Paper was released by the state government on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Judicial Panel Report had claimed that nine people were shot dead by the army and police, with several others injured at the Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020.\n\nThe report also said an additional four people missing were presumed dead.\n\nBut the government has rejected the report of the killings, saying that the report contradicted the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa.\n\nObafunwa had testified that only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on were from Lekki. Out of them, only one had gunshot injury.\n\nThe White Paper said: \u201cThe JPI\u2019s finding of nine deaths is therefore irreconcilable with evidence of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died of gunshot wounds at 7:43pm at Lekki Tollgate on 21st October, 2020.\n\n\u201cHaving held that, there was no evidence before it to the contrary of what Prof. Obafunwa said. The question is, where did JPI then get its finding of nine deaths?\u201d\n\nAccording to the White Paper, \u201cThis finding of nine (9) deaths at LTG on 20th October 2020 is even more baffling because apart from listing out their names in tabular form at pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their death. The names simply sprang up at pages 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set out at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salami and Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the person listed as No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother who he alleged died at Lekki Tollgate (LTG), was himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u201cRemarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abuta Solomon) was then also listed as No 2 on the list of persons who died at LTG.\n\n\u201cThe only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43pm, on 21 October, 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99) Furthermore, there was no shred of evidence regarding who shot him.\n\n\u201cAnother substantial inconsistency in the JPI Report was the award of compensation to only one (1) out of the alleged nine (9), listed as \u201cdeceased\u201d which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the death of eight (8) other allegedly deceased persons on its list.\u201d\n\nThe White Paper added: \u201cOn the basis of the above fundamental inconsistencies in the findings of the JPI regarding the nine deaths at LTG and particularly because findings are clearly and manifestly not supported by evidence before the JPI as attested to by the JPI itself, when it said there was no contrary evidence to that of Prof. Obafunwa that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds at LTG on October 20, 2020, the State Government is therefore unable to accept the finding that nine people died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 20th October, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt also follows that the irresistible conclusion to be drawn from the JPI\u2019s acceptance of Prof Obafunwa\u2019s testimony that only one (1) person died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 21st October, 2020 is that there was no massacre at LTG, contextual or otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe findings of the JPI that nine died at LTG on 20th October 2020 from gunshots fired by the Military are based on assumptions and speculations.\n\n\u201cThe inconsistencies and contradictions in the entire JPI Report concerning the number of persons who died at LTG on 20th October, 2020 and their cause of death rendered the JPI\u2019s findings and conclusions therefrom as totally unreliable and therefore unacceptable.",

          "text": "There appears to be a confusion of sort in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) with some members forming a parallel national caretaker committee, purportedly sacking the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and scheduling the party\u2019s convention for February 26, 2022.\n\nBut the Buni-led CECPC has disowned the group which it described as impostors, and asked security agents to swoop on them.\n\nThe new group which appointed President Muhammadu Buhari as head of its advisory committee also named Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and others as members of the new caretaker Committee.\n\nAddressing journalists Monday in Abuja, the group under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) announced the sack of the Buni-led committee and announced a new national caretaker committee with Mustapha Audu as chairman.\n\nAudu, who briefed journalists on the development, also announced the formation of a national reconciliation committee with a mandate to reconcile aggrieved members before its national convention slated for February, 26, 2021.\n\nHe said a zoning formula for positions in the new National Working Committee is expected to emerge at a national convention slated for February 26, 2022.\n\nWhile inaugurating the new committee, Audu the self-acclaimed national chairman said: \u201cToday, we are here to inaugurate the PYM \u2013 CECPC, these young men and women of noble repute have been carefully selected and mandated by all the well-meaning young stakeholders of our great party- the APC- to plan and execute our convention before the end of February 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the plethora of issues within the party. Our party has had a history of shying away from true reconciliation and in many cases inflicting chastisement on members that should have been rewarded for their effort towards building the APC. We will also be setting up a reconciliatory committee to help reconcile aggrieved members within the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that in the last couple of years, the party has been on a regressive course and it is necessary for all well-meaning party members to roll up our sleeves and do the needful to ensure that we correct the mistakes that have been made to ensure victory in 2023 for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would advise all party members to look inwards and understand the need to do things differently so that we can ensure we win back the trust of the Nigerian people as we move closer to the election year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s join hands and strengthen our internal democracy in our dear party- the APC- and show Nigerians that we have what it takes and we deserve their votes in 2023,\u201d Audu added.\n\nCCEPC reacts\n\nReacting to the development in a statement, National Secretary of the Buni-led CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, described the new group as a \u201cpaid and misguided group.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cWe have received several enquiries from the media and concerned APC members on the felonious activities of a purported group parading themselves as \u201cProgressive Youth Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purported group and membership are unknown to the Party, its structure or as a registered support group. Hence, we completely disown them and cannot account for their activities or join issues with them.\n\n\u201cHowever laughable, the criminal attempt of the purported group to usurp the leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC now bothers (sic) on treasonable felony. Relevant security bodies must now check and address their unscrupulous activities.\n\n\u201cThe attention the purported group seeks will not be given to them by the party. We can only advise that the general public completely disregard them. Members of this group are not registered members of the APC and are being used by opposition elements and fifth columnists to cause confusion.\n\n\u201cAs widely reported, the successful meeting between the APC leadership, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and the President produced February 2022 as the timeframe for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cOur focus now is preparing the ground for a rancour-free exercise.\u201d\n\nSheriff tackles Buhari, govs\n\nIn a related development, an APC national chairmanship aspirant and former Borno state Governor Alimodu Sheriff has warned President Buhari and governors elected on the party platform against jettisoning the party\u2019s constitutional requirements for a national convention.\n\nThe former governor said both the president and the APC governors lacked the power to fix a date for the party\u2019s national convention unless a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting is summoned.\n\nSheriff spoke through his campaign media director, Senator Victor Lar in Abuja Monday.\n\nHe said the February date must therefore be rectified by the party\u2019s NEC to make it constitutional.\n\n\u201cWe want to add that though we have commended the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) for taking the initiative to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the need for the party\u2019s National Convention to hold, the decision to hold the convention in February 2022 has to be by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cIt is normal for members of the party\u2019s national caucus to meet that meeting between the PGF and the president was maybe a partial caucus meeting, even though it was not properly constituted and convened.\n\n\u201cBut both the governors and the president do not have the constitutional powers to take such decision. That decision is supposed to be taken by the party\u2019s NEC. So, we suggest that the APC governors, the president and the party should call a NEC meeting to rectify that February 2022 suggestion for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\u201cThe president does not have the constitutional powers to call for a meeting, neither do the governors. It is only the party\u2019s NEC that can take such decision as regards when its national convention will hold.\n\n\u201cWe, however, appeal to our members and supporters to remain calm and focused, we are on course and victory is certain,\u201d Modu Sheriff said.\n\nWhen asked to comment on media reports that APC has zoned the national chairmanship position to the North-central, Senator Lar described the report as laughable.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation finds the purported story as very laughable because the organs of the party that are supposed to communicate that kind of information, are not the ones communicating it, for that reason, we will take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cAgain, the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party has never adopted zoning. At what point did they start zoning that they are talking about zoning the party\u2019s national championship position to the North Central?\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an open contest and the best candidate should emerge for the party to be galvanised for victory in 2023 and Sheriff remains the best candidate. We find the report as the very poor scheming of people who are scared of contesting the position with Sheriff.\u201d\n\nParty denies zoning\n\nSpeaking on zoning, the APC said it did not discuss or reach any decision to zone its national chairmanship position to the North-central zone as reported in a section of the media.\n\nThe party\u2019s scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said the issue of zoning was not in the mandate of the CECPC. \u201cI have the mandate to report whatever decision the CECPC takes and to the best of my knowledge, the committee has not discussed zoning.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the party\u2019s national convention fixed for February 2022, it was expected that party members would come up with different zoning speculations.\n\n\u201cPeople are just flying what will favour their interest, all I know is that the caretaker committee has not discussed or reached a zoning decision,\u201d he said.\n\nMustapha lauds Buni c\u2019teee\n\nAlso speaking on the party leadership, a top national chairman ship aspirant, Malam Salihu Mustapha said the Buni-led committee was on course in its given assignment.\n\nHe said contrary to expectations in certain quarters, there was no uncertainty in the direction of the party under Buni\u2019s watch.\n\nMustapha said this at an interactive session with journalists recently in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere should be no blame game at this stage in our party. Honestly, there should be no blame game. Don\u2019t forget the caretaker committee has the mandate to stabilise the party, and that Governor Buni is doing creditably well. I think we should give it to him. This is not the time to be pointing accusing fingers. We must come together to ensure the committee realises its set objective of stabilising the party.\n\n\u201cYes, the committee is on course. No uncertainty in party direction. We are on the right course and we must not allow this collective effort to be derailed. The prayer is that we (referring to his chances) come out victorious so we, as a party, under my watch In Shaa Allah, can deliver dividends of democracy to Nigeria beyond the tenure of the present administration.\u201d\n\nOn what he hopes to do differently if he emerges as the party\u2019s chair, Mustapha, who was the deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) led by Buhari, said \u201cwhat I will do differently is looking at the future via what is obtainable now.\n\n\u201cIt is against this background that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made a 25-year-old man its national youth leader. So, if making a woman the national chairman is a strategy for a party to win election, why not?\u201d\n\nAssuring of a brighter chance over all fellow top contenders, the youthful politician said \u201cmy youthful age is an added advantage. Any party that wants to win in 2023 has to factor in the young generation because 75 per cent of the votes belong to the youths.\n\n\u201cThe ENDSARS has revealed some lessons. The message the ENDSARS was trying to pass before it was hijacked and mismanaged was that the youth should be effectively be part in the scheme of things. So, for me, having seen it all, I will perfectly fit into ensuring a kind of synergy between the old and the youth.\u201d\n\nWhile priding himself as having the endorsement of party stakeholders, Mustapha also said he looked forward to being the chairman for all.\n\n\u201cI want to be the chairman for all, and those contesting with me will be the first people I would approach after the election for them to buy into my programmes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC chieftain also identified the imposition of candidates on political parties as a major source of conflict in the nation\u2019s polity, saying this comes with a consequence.\n\n\u201cWe have seen several cases of imposition of unpopular candidates within our polity. You, as will suffer within and the party will also suffer outside because the ultimate of any political contest is to win election after which you settle down to good governance,\u201d Mustapha further added.\n\nThe former governorship aspirant in Kwara state also promised to bring about a leadership that would ensure equity and justice in the party and hold governors accountable to their manifestoes.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore the request of Igbo elders to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja Monday and signed by NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the forum said Buhari would be interfering in the judicial process should he consider the request of the Igbo elders.\n\nIt reads: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has carefully studied the request of Igbo Elders for President Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally. It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\n\n\u201cThe Forum noted a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommends greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development. In any event, the Forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Forum advises that the National census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. The integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity such as this will be compromised by destabilized and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity such as general elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum invites attention to the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lives. Increasing poverty levels and widespread insecurity demand that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the price of fuel in particular will compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians.

Investigations revealed that the modus operandi of the suspects include snatching the cars at gun point and sometimes removing the cars from where parked especially crowded car parks like the Cinema, Church and Mosque.\n\n\u201cThese cars are sold in neighbouring countries at give-away prices and sometimes delivered to Alhaji Garuba in exchange for illicit weapons. The INTERPOL unit of the Nigeria Police is already working with their counterparts in Niger Republic to arrest the fleeing suspects in order to bring them to book.\n\n\u201cSecondly, is the arrest of one 27yrs-old Dayyabu Mohammed of Soba LGA of Kaduna State for illegal possession of five (5) AK47 rifles and 250 rounds of AK47 ammunition. The suspect was arrested during a crackdown on bandits at Saminaka Forest in kaduna State by operatives of STS. Investigation shows that Dayyabu Mohammed is an arms supplier to two (2) identified and wanted bandits in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe two bandit kingpins are Yellow and Budderi. Dayyabu Mohammed was intercepted while ferrying the weapons from Jos, Plateau State in a Golf-3 saloon car to the Bandit in their hideouts located in a forest at Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna State. Investigations by the Police team revealed that the Golf-3 saloon car was given to Dayyabu as his operational vehicle by one of the wanted bandits, with a promise that the full ownership of the vehicle will revert to him on completion of five successful arms delivery missions.\n\n\u201cAlso, is the arrest of the perpetrators of a recent deadly attack on travellers in the Tafa axis of the Kaduna \u2013 Abuja highway where two (2) women and their husbands were abducted by the criminals into the forest. The operatives of the Special Tactical Squad deployed to that area were quickly mobilized and went after the suspects to rescue the victims. The Police operatives eventually identified the hideout of the criminals, launched a rescue mission and successfully rescued the hostages, including the women, unhurt.\n\n\u201cThe operatives equally apprehended a gang of six; Mohammed lawali, Suleiman Ibrahim, Mohammed Rebo, Bashir Audu, Monsoru Abubakar and Abubakar Hamidu, in connection with the attack on a Mosque in Mazakuka area in Mashegu LGA in Niger State where eighteen (18) people were reportedly killed and more than thirty (30) abducted. Investigations by the Police team revealed that the gang leader, Mohammed lawali and some of the gang members are escapees from the Lokoja correctional centre. Bashir Audu was arrested for his criminal role of supplying hard drugs to the gang. Two (2) AK47 rifles, three (3) fully-loaded magazines and various parcels of hard drugs were recovered from them.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), NPM, fdc while commending the team for the successful operations, assures the nation that the Force would continue to close-up on these criminal elements who pose threats to our national security. The IGP calls on members of the public who are victims of car theft to visit the STS office at Guzape, Abuja with proof of ownership to claim the vehicles bearing in mind that the colour, interior and vehicle number plate might have been tampered with.\n\n\u201cAll the suspects will be arraigned in court on completion of investigations.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday inaugurated the multi-billion naira Delta State Secretariat Complex named after the Asaba monarch, H.R.M, Prof. Chike Edozien.\n\nThe vice president described the Civil Service as the arrowhead of government at any level.\n\nOsinbajo also described Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as a visionary leader and commended his administration for building such a worthy monument to enhance efficiency in the public service and for naming the state-of-the-art edifice, which would house 27 state ministries, after Nigeria\u2019s oldest professor and reigning monarch, Edozien.\n\nAlso, the vice-president inaugurated the Asaba IPP (independent power project) established under a joint partnership with the Delta State Government and Bestanchury Power Solutions Nigeria Limited and Africa Plus Partners.\n\n\u201cThis is historic indeed, because the seat of the civil service of any arm of government anywhere in the world is usually one of the major monuments enshrining not just the power but also the splendour of the authority of government.\n\n\u201cThis imposing complex clearly meets this requirement. In due course, touch builders become historical monuments and the commissioning of this secretariat is special in two different ways. First the civil service and the people of Delta are today being presented with the state of the art functional and befitting secretariat after many years.\n\n\u201cThis is worthy of great celebration, but beyond that is the fact that it is, at the same time, immortalising one of the Nigeria\u2019s most illustrious sons, HRM Chike Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba, Nigeria\u2019s oldest living professor in any discipline and an internationally renowned professor of medicine.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMore importantly, he is an outstanding bridge-builder and patriot. He has played, and continues to play, an important role as a symbol of unity in the state.\n\n\u201cDuring his 30-year reign thus far, Asaba has changed dramatically, becoming the capital of the newly created Delta State in 1991, and has attracted people from far and wide that have come to seek their fortunes here.\n\n\u201cHis traditional leadership has ensured that the growth and increasing diversity of Asaba has proceeded without tension and antagonism among those who live here.\n\n\u201cI believe that naming this building after Asagba, you are not just celebrating a highly respected deserving son of Delta State and Nigeria, you are also signalling a sort of excellence in public service that we wish to see incubated in this complex.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, more importantly you are saying to a generation that is not even old enough to be employed into the service that integrity, diligence and service to community still pay. It is my hope that this place will be a symbol of unity and distinction.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said he was delighted that Okowa has demonstrated responsible and visionary leadership in that his administration has consistently defied the economic downturn that had put much pressure on financial resources at all levels of government in Nigeria, executing worthy projects.\n\n\u201cThere is more for which Okowa deserves commendation. Despite dwindling revenue receipt and severe resource constraints across all levels of government, he has been able to provide funding for this project.\n\n\u201cAlso your recognition of the critical role of the public sector is notable, whether we are talking about a need for a more Internally Generated Revenue and greater tax efficiency, compensation for resource deficit or the management of the public health crisis such as the pandemic or even the drive for a more IGR, it is the capacity of the public sector that is invariably an issue,\u201d he added.\n\nWelcoming the vice-president and the many personages and people, including the Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri; Deputy Governor of Edo State, Mr. Philip Shuaibu, Okowa thanked Osinbajo for his support and encouragement.\n\nOkowa said, \u201cBy now, many people will probably be wondering if the Vice-President has Delta roots. We have lost count of the number of times he has been here on official engagements.\n\n\u201cI stand here today feeling very proud of this legacy project. Indeed, I am filled with a great sense of joy, satisfaction, fulfilment, and triumph. It was an arduous journey from the time construction commenced on November 27, 2017, to this momentous occasion. As you would expect, constructing an edifice like this would task the ingenuity, resources, and patience of any government in the times we live in.\n\n\u201cIt was quite demanding and exacting, and there were times we were tempted to throw up our hands in despair, and even questioned the wisdom for embarking on a project of this magnitude. The turbulence that has plagued the economy since 2017 was worsened with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing major financial disruptions during the construction process.\n\n\u201cWith the ministries in one central location, the state government will be saving hundreds of millions of naira that was spent annually in renting offices all over the capital city. Coordination and synergy among MDAs would be enhanced, leading to higher morale, better time management, efficiency, and greater productivity.\n\n\u201cThis sprawling office complex occupies a total floor space of 45, 000 square metres. It is designed around five clusters with multiple floors, each cluster around a courtyard. This concept allows plenty of natural light and ventilation into the offices.\n\n\u201cAll the 27 ministries and their commissioners and permanent secretaries will be housed here, with the entire secretariat interconnected through a system of voice and data networks.\u201d\n\nOmon-Julius Onabu in Asaba",

          "text": "A disturbing, hard to watch two minute, eight seconds video of how the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the security wing of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), celebrated the abduction and beheading of two out of three police officers, has surfaced online, causing shock and disbelief across the social space.\n\nThe repulsive video featured some young men, believed to be IPOB/ESN members, communicating in the Igbo language and surrounding two severed heads of the police officers, placed by a fire they set up as if being roasted, in a remote place.\n\nThe brutish young men, who cannibalised the deceased, clowned and scorned them, even as they repeatedly stated that, one of the two killed looked like a \u201cFulani\u201d from the look of his nose, the third officer was seen sitting on the floor with his fate unknown at the time the video was released.\n\nBut the federal government, which described the development as unacceptable, has vowed to bring to justice, the persons behind the gruesome murder of the two policemen.\n\nAlso, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), on Monday, kicked against alleged plans by President Muhammadu Buhari to succumb to pressure and terminate the on-going trial of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in a statement on Monday, described the abduction of the three policemen and the killing of two of them, in the most horrific, barbaric and cannibalistic manner, as an unacceptable attack against the Nigerian state.\n\nHe condemned the murder of two policemen, warning that those, who carried out the killings, videotaped their heinous act and circulated such would be apprehended and brought to justice.\n\nMohammed identified the officers as ASP Francis Idoko (AP No. 154945); Inspector Emmanuel Akubo (AP No. 222336) and Inspector Rufai Adamu (AP. No. 285009), all serving officers of the Nigeria Police.\n\nAccording to him, they were abducted on November 27, 2021 by members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), acting on the instructions of their leader, Chinonso Okafor, otherwise known as Temple.\n\n\u201dTwo of the officers, Inspectors Akubo and Adamu, were killed in the most gruesome manner and their decapitated bodies videotaped and circulated widely. The leader of the ESN team that killed the two officers is one \u2018Gentle\u2019.\n\n\u201dChinonso Okafor, the most influential commander of ESN in charge of Imo and Anambra States, as well as \u2018Gentle\u2019 and all those who perpetrated the abhorrent act will be made to face swift and sure justice,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile condemning the targeting and killing of security agents under any guise as a direct attack on the state that would not be tolerated, the minister said the continued attacks on security agents and agencies of government by ESN/IPOB ran contrary to calls in certain quarters for a political solution to the IPOB issue.\n\nHe also queried why those making calling for political solution have yet to condemn the appalling murder of serving police officers.\n\nThe minister, however, paid glowing tributes to the officers, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service to their fatherland, as well as all security agents, who were serving the nation to the best of their ability in a most difficult moment.\n\nHe further condoled with the families of the slain officers, praying that God to comfort and strengthen them.\n\nMeanwhile, NEF, while advising President Buhari not to yield to pressure to release Kanu, said granting such request could do more harm to the country.\n\nA group under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, had recently met with the president at the State House, Abuja, where they demanded unconditional release of the IPOB leader.\n\nThe president said their demand for unconditional release of Kanu was a difficult one, but he would consider the request of the respected Igbo leaders.\n\nNEF Kicks against Kanu\u2019s Release\n\nBut the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of NEF, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a statement yesterday said there were no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has carefully studied the request of Igbo Elders for President Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally. It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response, which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request, and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\u201d\n\nThe forum alluded to a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommended greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development.\n\nIt added, \u201cIn any event, the forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\u201d\n\nThe forum further advised that the national census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. It said the integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity, such as census, would be compromised by destabilised and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity, general election.\n\nWhile decrying the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lived, the forum noted that the increasing poverty level and widespread insecurity demanded that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\nIt stressed that an increase in the price of fuel, in particular, would compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians.\n\nNEF said it was important that decisions on this matter included consideration of the interests of the national economy, welfare of the citizens, and reactions of a hard-pressed citizenry.\n\nKalu\u2019s Visit to Kanu\n\nIn a related development, Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, yesterday, visited Kanu, in the custody of the Department of State Services and advised him to be wary of some of his actions.\n\nKalu, in a statement personally signed, said the IPOB leader was in good health and under proper care.\n\nThe former governor of Abia State, however, noted that he spoke with Kanu as a brother and told him the need to consider the consequences of certain actions that he would be taking.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis afternoon, I visited my brother, Maazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, Abuja. I met him in good health and care and we discussed as \u2018Umunne\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, when I was Governor, I made his father Eze Israel Okwu Kanu, the traditional ruler of Akwara Ukwu and since then the family has been very close to me.\n\n\u201cI understand that Nnamdi has an insane number of people rooting for him back home and I encouraged him to consider the consequences of certain actions and utterances for the sake of the same people.\n\n\u201cEven though my ideology and his ideology are totally different, God has made us brothers and we can\u2019t run away from each other. I owe him and Nigerians good counselling, whether he and his family listen to me or not. I will continue to counsel him as I have always done in the past.

          "text": "As countries across the world continued to take measures to prevent the spread of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, Nigeria on Monday said there was currently no reported detection of the strain in the country.\n\nNational COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Mukhtar Muhammad, stated this position yesterday in Abuja at a media briefing organised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19.\n\nAddressing journalists, Muhammad stressed that as of yesterday, there had not been any detected case, saying, \u201cthe PSC has continued to review our risk of this latest information and take every necessary step to stop it from being imported into the country. We have taken far-reaching proactive measures to minimise and mitigate this possibility.\u201d\n\nThe discovery last week by South Africa and Botswana of the more infectious variant of COVID-19 elicited global concern.\n\nMuhammad said PSC would be issuing a travel guideline today to prevent the virus from spreading. The new travel guideline will require passengers arriving the country to do a PCR test 48 hours before departing.\n\nThey would also do day two and day seven PCR tests on arrival while they will be required to self-isolate for seven days, he added.\n\nMuhammad explained: \u201cPassengers that are outbound, going out of Nigeria, will be required to either show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or provide a negative PCR test taken 48 hours before departure. These conditions apply to diplomats as well. The measures will come into effect by Friday, 3rd of December, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Technical Secretariat of PSC said the authority would ensure that there was enforcement on passengers who arrived and refused to take tests, through suspension of their passports and prosecution, or both.\n\nHe added that PSC would step up surveillance at the ports of entry into the country, intensify testing and contact tracing, and optimise sequencing capacity.\n\nMuhammad decried the promotion of vaccine nationalism, a pervasive inequality at the global level that made rich countries to be able to procure vaccines for their own citizens, through direct agreements with pharmaceutical companies, while low and middle countries lagged behind. He said this was one of the factors fuelling COVID-19 and the emergence of variants of concern, including Omicron.\n\nHe warned that lack of vaccination in developing countries would provide a fertile ground for the virus to develop mutations, which will in turn threaten progress already recorded. Muhammad called on the developed countries to support efforts being made globally to ensure that there was equity and access to vaccines.\n\nThe federal government also said it was reviewing the situation around the world and putting in place measures to curtail the effect of the new variant on the country.\n\nSpeaking at the national briefing of the committee, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, PSC on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha, urged Nigerians to exercise extra caution and vigilance in practice and enforcement of preventive measures.\n\nMustapha stated, \u201cAs the DG WHO has just stated today, the emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is. South Africa and Botswana should be thanked for detecting, sequencing and reporting this variant, not penalised.\u201d\n\nHe said both South Africa and Botswana should be commended for not hiding Omicron but revealing to WHO the outcome of their sequencing.\n\nMustapha warned that other countries might in future choose to maintain silence, in the process putting the world at risk, instead of disclosing discovery of new outbreaks in order not to suffer liabilities, like the ones South Africa and Botswana are suffering.\n\nThe SGF said PSC was aware of some travellers circumventing the travel protocols by providing fake COVID-19 test results, vowing, \u201cThe weight of the law is heavy and will come hard on these people.\u201d\n\nMustapha said under the Vaccine Mandate that would come into effect fully on December 1, 2021, every federal government worker and, in essence, all Nigerians and residents were expected to get vaccination.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith the developments around the world, people will not be able to travel without their verified vaccination cards.\u201d\n\nThe SGF also said the impasse on the Nigeria-UAE flights had been resolved in the interest of both parties. He said though this process had taken so long to pull through, with its ripple effects, everyone involved in getting the deal deserved plaudits.\n\n\u201cA date for the commencement of flights between the two countries will be announced in due course,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SGF also said PSC\u2019s nine months mandate extension would end on December 31. He said to effectively capture the core elements of the national response, a National Summit to end COVID-19 in 2022 and to strengthen Global Health Security was being planned to hold in Abuja 6-7 December.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\n",
