          "title": "After 23 years of battling infertility, failed IVF, I conceived twins naturally \u2013 49-year-old school proprietor",
          "text": "While it\u2019s not impossible to become pregnant naturally in the late 40s or 50s, it is, nevertheless, rare with experts always warning that conceiving at such age can increase the risk of some health problems for the baby and the mother. Mrs. Modupe Gabriel, a school proprietress in Lagos, however, defied the odds by conceiving naturally at age 49 and giving birth to twins. The feat was also remarkable because Mrs. Gabriel had battled infertility for over 23 years and even had a failed IVF. LARA ADEJORO writes on the remarkable story of Mrs. Gabriel and the contentious medical issues about women with late pregnancies.\n\nAn overwhelming joy lit up her face the first time she saw her twin children \u2013 a boy and a girl. Carrying a pregnancy without any reproductive assistance during her run-up to the fifth decade is a big deal for her.\n\nMrs. Modupe Gabriel had no plan to have children late but things ended up that way for her as she had to battle infertility for 23 years.\n\nWhile she peers intently at her \u2018miracle babies\u2019, her mind flashed back to the years she was fervently expectant and battling infertility.\n\nShe visited several hospitals in her quest to get a solution to her fertility problem and even had a failed In vitro fertilisation treatment.\n\nShe recalled how she had to put on a brave face while with family and friends. Mrs. Gabriel, however, says she never slipped into a panic because of her condition but rather remained hopeful.\n\nAs a school proprietress in Lagos, she kept on with her work and responsibilities as a wife. She made up her mind never to compromise her faith despite the challenges.\n\nFortunately, she was confirmed pregnant a few months after her 49th birthday.\n\n\u201cI had been advised by people to go diabolical to have a child, I spent a lot of money going to hospitals, I\u2019ve had a failed IVF but I\u2019ve kept on trusting only in God.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that anything God cannot give me, I don\u2019t want. We waited patiently and it is indeed worth it, though it seems so tough and discouraging, however, with God by our side, it became a thing of the past,\u201d the delighted mother said.\n\nFor Mrs. Gabriel, being older didn\u2019t mean biting her nails with worry through the pregnancy despite the risks involved.\n\n\u201cI was told I had gotten to my menopausal stage but I was still menstruating. When I was confirmed pregnant, my doctor told me I needed to be on bed rest but I was strong and I was able to do my job in my school, I wasn\u2019t idle or lazy, I was up and doing,\u201d she said.\n\nHer children arrived in the New Year \u2013 January 25, 2022.\n\nPregnancy after age 45 likely, but rare\n\nHer late pregnancy is rare, but she is certainly not alone. While there is no national data on women with late pregnancy without reproductive assistance, findings show that few women in their late 50s have natural conception and deliver healthy babies.\n\nExperts say pregnancy after age 45 years is considered a high risk for the mother and baby.\n\nA Professor of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Rotimi Akinola said it is out of the ordinary to have a baby in the late 40s or 50s but nothing is impossible.\n\n\u201cIn medicine, you never say never. So, if somebody has late menopause, she still has eggs to shed, so it\u2019s not impossible for that person to get pregnant, maybe accidentally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing is that the eggs that will be shed at 49 have a high risk of genetic abnormality,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nAccording to him, conceiving a child without IVF or other interventions presents an increased risk of certain chromosomal problems with age.\n\n\u201cFor people from the age of 37, they begin to have that risk so I won\u2019t be surprised if, at 49, you have a risk of about 1 in 60 that it might be genetically abnormal, chromosomal abnormal like Down syndrome.\u201d\n\nProf. Akinola, however, noted that most times, women with late pregnancy are not honest with the method of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cWhen you are hearing that 60 years old give birth, they often do with assistance and often, that assistance is with donated eggs.\n\n\u201cPlenty of women in their 40s have children but have a high risk of genetic abnormality. As long as you\u2019re not menopausal, it\u2019s possible that they still have a few eggs and those eggs can still yield children but from 59, most women in that age group will be menopausal and menopause simply means no more eggs. If such a person menstruates, it will send panic to the doctors because the person might be dealing with tumors.\n\n\u201cWhen the eggs are no longer there, the only way that person can conceive is through assisted reproduction with the help of donated eggs.\u201d\n\nRisk for complications increases\n\nThe gynaecologist said it will be challenging for such a woman to maintain her health because of the chance of becoming hypertensive or diabetic.\n\nHe noted that the older an egg, the more likely it is to have chromosomal issues, which can increase the child\u2019s risk for birth defects.\n\n\u201cEverything that happens to somebody who is old \u2013 hypertension, diabetes are problems they can have and once they come in, they affect the outcome of the pregnancy. A woman who has late pregnancy has a chance of developing hypertension, gestational diabetes which can create a problem for the mother and baby.\u201d\n\nAkinola recommends adoption for women who battle fertility for a long time instead of risking their lives.\n\nFertility in women after age 45\n\nIn a study published in the International Journal of Fertility, the researchers say pregnancy after age 45 years is infrequent and noted also that the mother and baby should be considered as a high risk.\n\nAccording to them, there is a greater incidence of spontaneous abortion, gestational trophoblastic disease, and chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.\n\n\u201cBirth control practices should be discontinued after 49 years of age in the best interest of the woman\u2019s sexuality if abortion is acceptable to her. The patient should be completely informed of the risks and, in the event of pregnancy, abortion should be advised.\n\nThe researchers obtained data of 72,005 pregnant individuals age 45 years and older at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington.\n\nThe women were contrasted according to age, gravidity, parity, abortions, outcome of pregnancy, complications, and birth control practices. 10 patients menstruated to age 55 with an occasional missed period, 63 patients menstruated regularly to age 50, and the remainder had irregular menses before complete cessation of menstruation.\n\nNone of these patients after age 49 years used contraception or hormone replacement therapy. 25 of this group had endometrial biopsies as an office procedure or hospital dilatation and curettage for irregular bleeding. Eight of the 25 demonstrated secretory endometrium with evidence of ovulation. There were no pregnancies in this group of women.\n\n\u201cThere were 82 pregnancies that occurred in women 45 years of age and older. The oldest in this group delivered 6 days after her 49th birthday and one week beyond her expected date of confinement. This was her 10th pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThere were 24,779 abortions in the study period. The total number of induced abortions during the period was 17,869 with 31 patients 45-51 years of age. There were four patients 48-49 years of age and one patient 51 years. The data collected reconfirm that pregnancies in older women are infrequent and must be considered as high risk.\u201d\n\nThe researchers emphasised that the gynecologist should counsel the patient realistically as to her chances of becoming pregnant after age 48; the risk of pregnancy in the older woman relative to the risk of various birth control practices must be carefully weighed.\n\nSlowing down menopause\n\nLead Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Dr. Joseph Okoeguale, said smoking accelerates menopause.\n\nDr. Okoeguale added that risk factors for early menopause include severe infection of the ovaries, ovarian tumors, exposure to irradiation or use of chemotherapy, ovariectomy, oophorectomy, or post-operative ovarian gangrene.\n\n\u201cThe onset of menopause is biologically determined by age. It is relatively constant and not influenced by any factor.\n\n\u201cHowever, female smokers are known to attain menopause earlier than non-smokers and this effect is unrelated to body weight or the number of cigarettes smoked. Smoking has been said to induce hepatic metabolism of estrogen thereby leading to an earlier drop in its levels.\n\nThe average age of menopause in industrialised countries is 51 years. Early menopause is said to occur when menstruation ceases before age 45 years. Age remains an independent factor for menopause; gene plays little or no role,\u201d Okoeguale said.\n\nAccording to the expert, nothing can be done to prevent, postpone or slow down physiological menopause but artificial menopause can be prevented by clinicians by protecting the ovaries from radiation exposure, elective ovarian removal, cautious pelvic surgeries, avoiding cigarette smoking.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Studies have shown it\u2019s possible to outgrow asthma \u2013Physician",
          "text": "Godfrey George\n\nAn Ogun State-based general practitioner, Dr. Shina Ajidahun, speaks to GODFREY GEORGE about asthma and its management\n\nWhat is asthma?\n\nAs a way of introduction, asthma is from a Greek word, which means \u2018panting\u2019. It is a disease of the airway in which these airways become hypersensitive and in the process get blocked because there are a lot of chemicals released and a lot of other things going on. This would make the person have difficulty breathing and chest tightness.\n\nWhat causes asthma?\n\nThe world of science is still trying to understand very much the causes of asthma. There have been a lot of hypotheses and a lot of research. To some extent, we know there is an interplay between the environment and genetics. For genetics, we know that there are some genes, when they are mutated, can predispose one to have asthma. It has also been proven that asthma can run in families. The kind of environment one grows up in too can be a factor. Environments with a lot of pollution like you have in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, where you have a lot of sooth in the air and other environmental and air pollution, are not healthy for anyone to live in. There are things that can trigger asthma. Tobacco smoking and other exposure to allergies are things that can predispose one to have this condition. There have been other hypotheses like what we call the hygiene hypothesis. Here, we say, a low level of hygiene can predispose one to have asthma. In a dirty environment, a child is exposed to a lot of bacteria and all that and the immunity may not be well-developed, so the child can pick up asthma just like any other disease. This is just a hypothesis \u2013 the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nAre there types of asthma?\n\nThere are different types of asthma? We have early-onset asthma, which happens before the age of 12. There is also the late-onset, which occurs later in life. Exclusive breastfeeding may reduce the risk of a child getting asthma. When a child is exclusively breastfed, it would help the child to withstand these issues, studies have shown. Breastfeeding reduces the chances of a child having asthma to the barest minimum. Someone that is exposed to things like smoke and other toxins has a higher likelihood of contracting asthma. Usually, asthma for children starts when they have this shortness of breath, where one may be feeling that they cannot really breathe. Because of this, you will see this feeling of chest tightness and you would find them always coughing, and may be coughing out sputum. These are the classical factors. There are other allergic conditions that a child may have and when you visit the hospital as a parent, they would tell you it is asthma. For a lot of people, it is until they have an attack that the diagnosis is first made. Else, it is hard to tell whether or not a child is asthmatic.\n\nWhat should a mother do when they notice signs of asthma in their child?\n\nSuch a mother has to get to the hospital and get a clinical diagnosis. The doctor needs to confirm that the condition is really asthma by using what is called a spirometry. The first thing to counsel a mother whose child is asthmatic is to avoid the trigger. From what I explained, there are a lot of things that can trigger asthma, such as dust, smoke, pollution, etc. The first thing is to avoid all that. Another thing you should do is to train the mothers and their children on how to use the inhalers. You never can tell, a lot of things, both emotionally and physically, can trigger an asthmatic attack. Some exercises and drugs can also be triggers, even a chest infection. So, it would be in the best interest of the doctor to teach the mother how to use the inhaler and monitor the progress to be sure it is working.\n\nThere are different types of asthma which can go from mild to moderate and to severe. There is a ladder in medical practices, so if the child doesn\u2019t respond to a particular drug, doctors know what to add. The basis of the whole treatment is identifying triggers. There are also lifestyle modifications. If you are staying in a place like Port Harcourt, the best thing is to relocate since you cannot stop what is going on. If they are smokers or have someone smoking around them, they should also avoid all that. Also,, make sure the environment is clean and rid of dust because this dust can trigger these attacks.\n\nAre there conditions associated with asthma?\n\nThere are a number of conditions that can accompany asthma. It is not something that happens to everyone. There are some people who develop allergies to food. People who may begin to have anxiety disorder can be said to be associated with asthma. Some links are also trying to establish a lead between obesity and asthma.\n\nWhat advice would you give to people who take asthma medications that don\u2019t seem to work?\n\nAsthma is not something you would say you want to keep the host at home. The child should be taken to the hospital. There is a way we grade if someone is having mild, moderate, or severe asthma based on the level of attacks. It helps to grade the severity. Some people can have an acute exacerbation, which is like an attack. So, we put all that together to see the severity of asthma and the best way to administer help. When one has an attack and the person can be admitted to a clinic, there are different medications that can be given to them. If it is not working, we know when to go to the next level. If we see someone whose oxygen circulation is low or one whose chest is silent, we know what to do. If worse comes to worst, we may need to admit the person to the intensive care unit.\n\nIs it possible for one to outgrow asthma?\n\nIt has been shown that some people can outgrow asthma. It is a possibility, and that also depends on the type of asthma. Studies have shown that some people can actually outgrow asthma but this is not for everyone. It is a possibility.\n\nAre you saying it can be cured?\n\nAsthma does not have a cure, but it can be treated and managed. There is no drug or medication one can be administered that makes asthma just go like that. One can improve the symptoms where the person can function and access their day-to-day activities and would not have an attack late. One can manage it very well.\n\nIf one has an asthmatic attack and there is no inhaler nearby, what should the people around do to help this person?\n\nI will be very honest. If it were an ideal country, I would advise these bystanders to call 911 and wait for the ambulance to come. But if this person collapses on the road in Nigeria with an asthmatic attack, there is little a bystander can do other than rush the person to the nearest hospital. You cannot put your hands in the person\u2019s lungs to open it up. If there are emergency responses in the state where it happened, that is the best place to start. A lot of treatment of the exacerbation, which is the attack, is something that only the hospital can give to the patient.\n\nHow would you react to Nigerians who do not like finishing the doses of their medications once they feel better?\n\nThe worst that can happen to this set of people is death because asthma can kill. That is why we do multidisciplinary management when it comes to managing asthma. We get a lot of people to join in the fight against ignorance. Asthma is a big deal. It is not just coughing. If it\u2019s not attended to on time, the person can die. If there is a delay in getting to the hospital and there is no inhaler nearby, it could get really worse. All asthmatic patients must have their inhalers nearby. It would be a very stupid thing for one to say because they haven\u2019t had an attack in a while, they shouldn\u2019t go around with their inhalers. It is a very dangerous thing for one to do and I would not advise that.\n\nIn this period of COVID-19 when people have to wear masks; what would be the fate of asthmatic people?\n\nA face mask is physically protective against the COVID-19 virus we are all trying to run away from. There is also a lot of space for one to breathe. There are a lot of chemicals being released that shut down the airways. So, people who have asthma should continue to wear their masks. But if they are having an attack, you have to take it away so you can breathe properly so it doesn\u2019t get too bad for the patient to be on oxygen.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Godfrey George\n\nAn Ogun State-based general practitioner, Dr. Shina Ajidahun, speaks to GODFREY GEORGE about asthma and its management\n\nWhat is asthma?\n\nAs a way of introduction, asthma is from a Greek word, which means \u2018panting\u2019. It is a disease of the airway in which these airways become hypersensitive and in the process get blocked because there are a lot of chemicals released and a lot of other things going on. This would make the person have difficulty breathing and chest tightness.\n\nWhat causes asthma?\n\nThe world of science is still trying to understand very much the causes of asthma. There have been a lot of hypotheses and a lot of research. To some extent, we know there is an interplay between the environment and genetics. For genetics, we know that there are some genes, when they are mutated, can predispose one to have asthma. It has also been proven that asthma can run in families. The kind of environment one grows up in too can be a factor. Environments with a lot of pollution like you have in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, where you have a lot of sooth in the air and other environmental and air pollution, are not healthy for anyone to live in. There are things that can trigger asthma. Tobacco smoking and other exposure to allergies are things that can predispose one to have this condition. There have been other hypotheses like what we call the hygiene hypothesis. Here, we say, a low level of hygiene can predispose one to have asthma. In a dirty environment, a child is exposed to a lot of bacteria and all that and the immunity may not be well-developed, so the child can pick up asthma just like any other disease. This is just a hypothesis \u2013 the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nAre there types of asthma?\n\nThere are different types of asthma? We have early-onset asthma, which happens before the age of 12. There is also the late-onset, which occurs later in life. Exclusive breastfeeding may reduce the risk of a child getting asthma. When a child is exclusively breastfed, it would help the child to withstand these issues, studies have shown. Breastfeeding reduces the chances of a child having asthma to the barest minimum. Someone that is exposed to things like smoke and other toxins has a higher likelihood of contracting asthma. Usually, asthma for children starts when they have this shortness of breath, where one may be feeling that they cannot really breathe. Because of this, you will see this feeling of chest tightness and you would find them always coughing, and may be coughing out sputum. These are the classical factors. There are other allergic conditions that a child may have and when you visit the hospital as a parent, they would tell you it is asthma. For a lot of people, it is until they have an attack that the diagnosis is first made. Else, it is hard to tell whether or not a child is asthmatic.\n\nWhat should a mother do when they notice signs of asthma in their child?\n\nSuch a mother has to get to the hospital and get a clinical diagnosis. The doctor needs to confirm that the condition is really asthma by using what is called a spirometry. The first thing to counsel a mother whose child is asthmatic is to avoid the trigger. From what I explained, there are a lot of things that can trigger asthma, such as dust, smoke, pollution, etc. The first thing is to avoid all that. Another thing you should do is to train the mothers and their children on how to use the inhalers. You never can tell, a lot of things, both emotionally and physically, can trigger an asthmatic attack. Some exercises and drugs can also be triggers, even a chest infection. So, it would be in the best interest of the doctor to teach the mother how to use the inhaler and monitor the progress to be sure it is working.\n\nThere are different types of asthma which can go from mild to moderate and to severe. There is a ladder in medical practices, so if the child doesn\u2019t respond to a particular drug, doctors know what to add. The basis of the whole treatment is identifying triggers. There are also lifestyle modifications. If you are staying in a place like Port Harcourt, the best thing is to relocate since you cannot stop what is going on. If they are smokers or have someone smoking around them, they should also avoid all that. Also,, make sure the environment is clean and rid of dust because this dust can trigger these attacks.\n\nAre there conditions associated with asthma?\n\nThere are a number of conditions that can accompany asthma. It is not something that happens to everyone. There are some people who develop allergies to food. People who may begin to have anxiety disorder can be said to be associated with asthma. Some links are also trying to establish a lead between obesity and asthma.\n\nWhat advice would you give to people who take asthma medications that don\u2019t seem to work?\n\nAsthma is not something you would say you want to keep the host at home. The child should be taken to the hospital. There is a way we grade if someone is having mild, moderate, or severe asthma based on the level of attacks. It helps to grade the severity. Some people can have an acute exacerbation, which is like an attack. So, we put all that together to see the severity of asthma and the best way to administer help. When one has an attack and the person can be admitted to a clinic, there are different medications that can be given to them. If it is not working, we know when to go to the next level. If we see someone whose oxygen circulation is low or one whose chest is silent, we know what to do. If worse comes to worst, we may need to admit the person to the intensive care unit.\n\nIs it possible for one to outgrow asthma?\n\nIt has been shown that some people can outgrow asthma. It is a possibility, and that also depends on the type of asthma. Studies have shown that some people can actually outgrow asthma but this is not for everyone. It is a possibility.\n\nAre you saying it can be cured?\n\nAsthma does not have a cure, but it can be treated and managed. There is no drug or medication one can be administered that makes asthma just go like that. One can improve the symptoms where the person can function and access their day-to-day activities and would not have an attack late. One can manage it very well.\n\nIf one has an asthmatic attack and there is no inhaler nearby, what should the people around do to help this person?\n\nI will be very honest. If it were an ideal country, I would advise these bystanders to call 911 and wait for the ambulance to come. But if this person collapses on the road in Nigeria with an asthmatic attack, there is little a bystander can do other than rush the person to the nearest hospital. You cannot put your hands in the person\u2019s lungs to open it up. If there are emergency responses in the state where it happened, that is the best place to start. A lot of treatment of the exacerbation, which is the attack, is something that only the hospital can give to the patient.\n\nHow would you react to Nigerians who do not like finishing the doses of their medications once they feel better?\n\nThe worst that can happen to this set of people is death because asthma can kill. That is why we do multidisciplinary management when it comes to managing asthma. We get a lot of people to join in the fight against ignorance. Asthma is a big deal. It is not just coughing. If it\u2019s not attended to on time, the person can die. If there is a delay in getting to the hospital and there is no inhaler nearby, it could get really worse. All asthmatic patients must have their inhalers nearby. It would be a very stupid thing for one to say because they haven\u2019t had an attack in a while, they shouldn\u2019t go around with their inhalers. It is a very dangerous thing for one to do and I would not advise that.\n\nIn this period of COVID-19 when people have to wear masks; what would be the fate of asthmatic people?\n\nA face mask is physically protective against the COVID-19 virus we are all trying to run away from. There is also a lot of space for one to breathe. There are a lot of chemicals being released that shut down the airways. So, people who have asthma should continue to wear their masks.

          "text": ".\n\n**Charges them to embrace Political Dynamism and rout out ballot snatching, voter apathy and arson.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai has tasked Nigerian Youths to resist the temptation of being used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\nIn a message to the youths titled, \u2018Dynamism in Politics and Nigeria\u2019s Founding Fathers\u2019, Buratai told the youths, \u201cYou must embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor that contributes to the democracy deficit in Nigeria, namely voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes. You constitute a large percentage of our voting and working population. You are also going to be the number one\n\n\u201cMy message to young people today is that they must not let themselves be used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\n\u201cInstead, you must embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor that contributes to the democracy deficit in Nigeria, namely voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes. You constitute a large percentage of our voting and working population.\n\n\u201cYou are also going to be the number one population block that will suffer the consequences of bad governance and incompetent leaders in the future. Therefore, you must do everything to safeguard your future survival and welfare in mind. Get actively involved in the democratic process by joining a political party and electing those who will lead you. Remember that voting is a civic duty expected of every Nigerian.\n\nThe text of the message to Nigerian Youths reads, \u201cLet me begin by stating unequivocally that I have spent my entire service life defending my nation and democracy because I am convinced that it is the political system most conducive to peace, sustainable development, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, which are the three pillars of any healthy and democratic nation.\n\n\u201cPermit me to utilize this opportunity to congratulate Nigeria and all Nigerians, particularly the youth, on 22 years of uninterrupted democratic administration.\n\n\u201cSome may argue that Nigeria\u2019s young democracy is nothing to celebrate because its elections, which are designed to serve as means for the peaceful resolution of political rivalries, are frequently flashpoints for political bloodshed.\n\n\u201cI concur that elections devoid of integrity cannot bring legitimacy to the winners, security to the losers, or public confidence in their leaders and institutions. This weakens polities by encouraging disaffected groups to seek out less constructive outlets for their discontent.\n\n\u201cBecause of this challenge associated with all nascent democracies, some people feel that there is no need to commend the Nigerian democratic project. I respectfully disagree.\n\n\u201cWe are evolving, and as you can see, the system is improving daily as a result of our leaders\u2019 periodic enhancements to the democratic system.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the 2022 Electoral Act which the President, Commander-in-Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari just signed into law, is a factor that will undoubtedly improve the transparency and acceptability of the country\u2019s future elections and promote democratic governance.\n\n\u201cDemocracy remains a universal aspiration because it actually delivers. For example, of the twenty countries with the highest levels of human development as measured by the UN\u2019s human development index, nineteen are liberal democracies.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nElectoral Act 2022: CSOs write INEC over review of Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency Bye-election\n\n\u201cAmong the top forty, thirty-six are liberal democracies. And even the citizens of poorer democracies live, on average, nine years longer than citizens of poor autocracies, because they have better access to health and education. Democracies are also less vulnerable to famines and conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt was the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who said, \u201cMan is, by nature, a political animal.\u201d It means that a man is born, lives, and dies as a member of a community, and the affairs of that community are therefore his and vice-versa. This is why since my transition back to civilian life from the Army, I have continued to participate in every civic activity I could to promote peace and strengthen our democracy. It is the reason I decided to send this message to all Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is known as the finest form of government. Why so? It is because, in a democracy, the people of the country choose their leaders who will then form a government to lead them. They enjoy certain rights that are very essential for any human being to live freely and happily.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Good governance has been defined to refer to structures and processes that are designed to ensure accountability, transparency, responsiveness, rule of law, stability, equity and inclusiveness, empowerment, and broad-based participation. Good governance also represents the norms, values and rules of the game through which public affairs are managed in a manner that is transparent, participatory, inclusive and responsive.\n\n\u201cIf we want to continue to make our democracy work and deliver dividends, we must take the critical issues of participation and a vibrant democratic system in Nigeria as sacrosanct, and our youths must embrace what I termed political dynamism.\n\n\u201cPolitical dynamism can be defined as vigorous political activity that is geared towards progress, and strength in the polity. It is usually characterized by patriotism, service to the fatherland, and youth inclusivity.\n\n\u201cYouth can be a creative force, a dynamic source of innovations, and they have undoubtedly, throughout history, participated, contributed, and even catalyzed important changes in political systems, power-sharing dynamics, and economic opportunities.\n\n\u201cHowever, young people also face poverty, barriers to education, multiple forms of discrimination, and limited employment prospects and opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is a global challenge although it differs across countries, and it is why the youth must take the issue of electing their leaders very seriously. Our greatest resource as a country is not crude oil or any of the natural minerals but our population, our youth.\n\n\u201cToday, we have the largest global youth population in history, and the large majority of young people around the world are committed to peace, sustainable development, and human rights.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time in the Army, I\u2019ve met with many groups of young people, including youth groups, student groups, and young leaders. I\u2019ve always been impressed by their talent, knowledge, and desire to make the world a better place.\n\n\u201cIf I should take you back to memory lane to the history of our founding fathers, which most people agree that Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, and Chief Obafemi Awolowo agreed on, you will find out that they all started as youths fired by political dynamism.\n\n\u201cDr. Azikiwe captured the nation\u2019s attention when, in 1937, he arrived in Nigeria with an electrifying personality and a bundle of talents, and on November 22, 1937, he published the maiden edition of his popular newspaper, The West African Pilot.\n\n\u201cThe Sardauna started to experiment with his leadership qualities right from Katsina Teachers\u2019 College, and later on, through political dynamism characterized by the inclusiveness of all ethnic nationalities in the North.\n\n\u201cSame with Awolowo who showed his people the power of education as a liberating and equalizing force in any society. All three of these great leaders practised political dynamism characterized by non-violence, patriotism, human development, and service to humanity.\n\n\u201cThe first time all three met together was on Friday, June 19, 1953. Enahoro\u2019s Self-Government-Now bill and the consequent resignation of all the Action Group\u2019s federal ministers caused a constitutional crisis that made Nigeria ungovernable.\n\n\u201cOliver Lyttleton, the secretary of state for colonies, tried to salvage the situation by inviting the main players to a constitutional conference in London. But Awolowo and Azikiwe, who had become friends since Enahoro\u2019s bill was tabled, refused the terms and conditions. Because the Sardauna was fine with them, Macpherson, Nigeria\u2019s governor, brought Sardauna, Azikiwe and Awolowo together in his office to jointly fashion new terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting, which ended at 10:10pm, he presented the trio to the media and the Daily Times the following day, naming them The Big Three. Since then, it has stuck that they were founding fathers because their tribes and their parties were the largest and because it offered an inclusive impression that all the regions had a say in the formation of the country.\n\n\u201cIn countries emerging from or facing conflicts, young people can engage in peace-building by leading non-violent movements and using innovative solutions to mobilize societies to bring about the needed transformation.\n\n\u201cYoung people have demonstrated the potential to build bridges across communities, working together to help manage conflict and promote peace. Young people play a big role in conflict and peace-building, and they can be agents of peaceful change and help rebuild lives and communities, making the world a better place.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has laid a foundation for a new Nigeria. Despite the myriad of challenges, he has kept faith in his vision and principles. The youths must carry these visions and principles beyond this administration. The legacies must be protected for a greater Nigeria and formidable future generations.\n\n\u201cMy message to young people today is that they must not let themselves be used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\n\u201cInstead, you must embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor that contributes to the democracy deficit in Nigeria, namely voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes. You constitute a large percentage of our voting and working population. You are also going to be the number one population block that will suffer the consequences of bad governance and incompetent leaders in the future.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you must do everything to safeguard your future survival and welfare in mind. Get actively involved in the democratic process by joining a political party and electing those who will lead you. Remember that voting is a civic duty expected of every Nigerian.\n\n\u201cI thank you all Great Nigerian Youths.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Esther Onyegbula\n\nFresh facts have emerged on the circumstances that led to the death of a 48-year-old artisan, Seun-Tijani Atepasile, who fell from a water tank he was repairing on top of a building situated in Gbagada, Lagos.\n\nThe news of the incident and eventual demise of Seun-Tijani Atepasile filtered out on December 6, 2021.\n\nSunday Vanguard learned that Atepasile had been contacted by one Lanre Okunade, a tenant in the said building, to carry out repairs on the leaking water tank mounted on top of the building.\n\nUnfortunately, that particular job would be his last as he was reported to have slipped from the top of the water tank and fell heavily to the ground, thereby sustaining grave injuries to his head and some parts of his body.\n\nSunday Vanguard gathered that Atepasile, a father of four, died as a result of the injuries he sustained.\n\nThree hospitals rejected him after which he was taken to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba where he passed on the following day.\n\nWife\u2019s account\n\nMrs Tijani Atepasile, wife of the deceased, who could not hold back tears, spoke to Sunday Vanguard, saying her husband died inside ambulance at LUTH premises six hours after he was brought to the hospital without being attended to.\n\n\u201cHe was given water and juice drink while screaming in pains by Lanre Okunade\u2019s wife who is a medical doctor, optician by profession at LUTH\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cI was in the market when my brother-in-law called to say my husband had an accident where he went to carry out repairs at a building and that I should come to LUTH\n\n\u201cImmediately I rushed down to the hospital. On getting there, I met my husband in an ambulance screaming in pains without being attended to, not even first aid was administered on him.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I heard Lanre Okunade\u2019s wife saying was that there was no bed space.\n\n\u201cIf my husband had been taken to a private hospital he wouldn\u2019t have died\u201d.\n\nLamenting, Festus Aighu, the artisan\u2019s colleague, agreed with Atepasile\u2019s widow, saying if the deceased had been attended to or taken to a private hospital he could have made it.\n\n\u201cOn the day of the incident both of us were supposed to have gone for the repairs but I went for another work\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we received a called that he had an accident, we rushed down to the said building, rescued him and took him to three different hospitals.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately all three hospitals rejected him due to the severe injuries he sustained; we then took him to LUTH where he was abandoned inside the ambulance until he gave up the ghost.\u201d\n\nAnother tenant in the building where the artisan fell, who did not want his name mentioned, blamed the occupant who invited Atepasile for disobeying all forewarnings about the said property and thus jeopardizing the life of the ill-fated artisan.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in that house is quite unfortunate but preventable. Merely looking at that property, one would easily notice the terrible state it is in. If care is not taken, we might be hearing another case of building collapse\u201d, he stated.\n\n\u201cI think that tenant should be held responsible for the death of the artisan because he knew the state of the house yet he engaged that innocent man to work there.\u201d\n\nMr John Adewale, another occupant, blamed the tenant for the incident.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is a clear case of negligence and wickedness. Why would any person ignore all expert warnings and still go ahead to carry out repairs on a decaying structure without obtaining proper approvals?\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a sad development that the police need to thoroughly investigate\u201d.\n\nIt was learnt the accident occurred around 4pm, but the victim was only taken to Lagos University Teaching Hospital at 10pm after being rejected at three different hospitals due to the severity of the injuries he sustained and claim of no bed space by the lawyer\u2019s wife who is a staff member at LUTH.\n\nHe gave up the ghost at about 3am the following day.\n\nBrother of the deceased, Mr Kabiru Atepasile, said \u201cproper medical attention was not given to my brother and he died in pains\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven while at LUTH, he was only given water and juice\u201d, Kabiru said.\n\n\u201cHe screamed all through due to pains coupled with the massive wound on his head, yet no one attended to him.\n\n\u201cTo make matters worse, my brother was not allotted any bed space or registered for the hours he spent in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe occupant who engaged him in the first place did not help matters.\n\n\u201cHe sat in his car outside the medical facility throughout the ordeal while his wife, whom we heard is an optician, bought water and 5alive for my dying brother\u201d.\n\nMr. Emmanuel, a security guard at the property where the incident occurred, told Sunday Vanguard that when the incident happened he rushed down to the spot and carried the victim on his shoulder to a nearby hospital where he was rejected.\n\n\u201cThe lawyer who engaged his services was inside his flat but came to join us there and took him to another hospital\u201d, he narrated.\n\n\u201cIt was later I learnt that the artisan had given up the ghost\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Esther Onyegbula\n\nWife of a businessman, Mrs. Adewola Adesioye Ojo, has raised the alarm over the disappearance of her 31-year-old husband, Michael Ojo, four months ago in Ibadan, Oyo State capital.\n\nMichael Ojo, a solar installer, was last seen on October 10, 2021, in the company of a lady with an undisclosed identity in a hotel.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Vanguard, the wife said, \u201cHe said he was going out at about 5pm. We chatted around 8pm on Whatsapp when he asked if there was light and said I should prepare Eba (cassava flour) for him. \u201cAfter preparing it, I put it on the dinning.\n\n\u201cI became worried when he did not return home by 9pm. I called his mobile line severally, he didn\u2019t pick.\n\n\u201cI called my brother-in-law to help me call him. After a while, he called back to say my husband\u2019s phone was switched off.\n\n\u201cWhen I dialed it, it was indeed switched off.\n\n\u201cI thought he did not want to come home and didn\u2019t know how to tell me.\n\n\u201cThe next day, I dialed his number again and it was still switched off. That was when I started calling his friends and they all said they didn\u2019t see him.\n\n\u201cI went to the nearest police station in the company of some of my husband\u2019s friends to lodge a complaint on his disappearance.\n\n\u201cWe were advised to go lyaganku Police Division.\n\nALSO READ: Potentially poisonous foods Nigerians love to eat\n\n\u201cAt the Division, the officers said we should go to their control room, where his information was collected and they called all the police stations in Oyo State to know if he was in police custody.\n\n\u201cThe Divisions called back that he was not in any of them.\n\n\u201cLater, we went to the Anti-kidnapping Squad at Dugbe, where they collected N35, 000 to track the first three numbers that he called.\n\n\u201cThey called someone in the Glo office to check the last three numbers that called him on the day he went missing.\n\n\u201cThe first number was his mother\u2019s, the second number was mine and the third number was his ex-girlfriend. \u201cThe police later arrested the ex-girlfriend who revealed that they both went to a hotel together that evening.\n\n\u201cShe said she left before my husband. The police went to the hotel and they confirmed that they both checked out but that the lady left him in front of the hotel.\n\n\u201cHowever, his ex-girlfriend revealed that when they were together in the hotel Michael was receiving a video call.\n\n\u201cShe said he also received a video call when he was leaving the house too\u201d.\n\nLamenting, the nursing mother of a five months old baby said police investigation seems to have come to a dead end without any information on her husband\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nShe also informed that his ex-girl friend who was arrested has been released.\n\nThe wife said, \u201cI can\u2019t even think straight, our wedding is not even up to a year\u201d.\n\n68\u2013year\u2013old mother of the missing man, Mrs. Bisi Ojo, who visited Vanguard Corporate headquarters in Lagos, called on the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Usman Akali Baba, to help investigate the whereabouts of her son.\n\nShe said, \u201cI am a widow.

          "text": "The AfricaNXT Conference 2022, known previously as Lagos Social Media Week, has ended on a historically impressive note for the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), having drawn the largest attendance and participation at a single session during the conference, where its team discussed the socio-economic benefits of 5G services.\n\nThe conference had scheduled over 200 sessions and about 400 speakers.\n\nHowever, NCC session was oversubscribed as all seats were occupied, while some participants had to stand to listen to the discussion on a topic that patently enthused and electrified the audience, and marked by very rare social networking and participation.\n\nOn Thursday, March 3, 2022, the NCC team mounted the FutureNow Stage of the Innovation Pavilion of the Conference to inform, educate and rally further support for the Commission\u2019s strides on the preparedness of Nigeria to deploy the Fifth Generation (5G) network and services.\n\nUsing simple, fact-based examples, the NCC\u2019s 5-man panel, provided necessary clarifications to the audience on the safety of 5G technology and gave copious examples about how the technology will significantly impact life qualitatively and bring socio-economic benefits to the citizens, businesses, the nation, and the continent of Africa.\n\nThe panelists extensively discussed 5G technology, focusing on safety, data privacy, the chronology of programmes, actions and activities of the Commission towards the launch of the services, including the issuance of 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum and licence for 5G deployment, the rollout plans, use cases as well as citing concrete socio-economic significance of the expected services.\n\nThe NCC team explained to the excited audience how 5G will power a plethora of applications, innovation and creativity. These include smart cities, telemedicine, Internet of Things (IoT), smart agriculture, driverless cars, bolstering of the security governance sector, among others. The team asserted that 5G is a network of networks because of its huge capabilities, and its derivable benefits can only be limited if humans limit their own imaginations.\n\nReckoning that 5G technology is a total shift from the internet connectivity people are used to at the moment, the panel stated that 5G would open doors of new possibilities and socio-economic impacts.\n\n\u201cWith 5G, there is something for everyone. Nigeria is kick-starting these massive benefits with enhanced broadband. 5G will bridge the fibre connectivity gap and with wireless broadband connectivity, Nigerians will enjoy the enhanced broadband,\u201d a member of the panel stated to emphasize enhanced connectivity that comes with 5G technology.\n\nThe discussants also agreed that telecom operators will reap huge benefits from 5G in many ways, through network slicing, new revenue streams from IoT, industrial applications, gaming and entertainment as well as live broadcast features supported by 5G amongst others.\n\nThe NCC team comprising specialists in engineering, law and communications, also said that 5G will power more than a billion devices in the next two years, and this means there will be upsurge in the manufacturing of related user equipment which is expected to bring down the prices of associated devices and equipment.\n\nThe process is also expected to trigger utilisation of raw materials such as rare earth metals that are found in large quantities in Africa, and cities will equally benefit from the 5G enabled infrastructure such as smart street lighting, smart traffic control systems, maintenance services and so on that will deliver huge economic gains.\n\nExplaining NCC\u2019s efforts and plans on consumer safety in the 5G era, discussants recalled that the Commission was already working closely with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) to develop a Risk Management Frameworks. The framework will grow the need for the ethical hacking skill set and allow the use of ethical hacking as part of risk management towards ensuring the cyber space safety during 5G era.\n\nAdditionally, the panel informed the audience that NCC had established a sectoral Computer Security Incidents Response Team (CSIRT) to work with the telecoms operators to reduce risks on the cyber-attacks and data breach.\n\nThe Centre, inaugurated in 2021, has been collaborating with the national agency, the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT), towards enhancing the security of the cyber space and privacy of citizens. These strategic collaboration, for which NCC is noted, will now be boosted by the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau, recently established by the Federal Government.\n\nWhile explaining the security, safety and speed characteristic of 5G, the panel reasoned that, while 4G has a response time of 10 millisecond, equivalent of the capacity of human brain, 5G network is even faster. Therefore, the high-speed feature of 5G will make it unlock greater opportunities that will enhance human productivity for the development.\n\n\u201cThe latency of 5G, which measures its response time, is 1 millisecond, while that of 4G is measured at 10 milliseconds. While 4G can accommodate 100,000 device connections in one square kilometre, 5G can connect a million devices within the same space, and thus, power Internet of Things (IoT). Also, 5G peak data rate is 20 gigabits (GB) per second for download, and 10GB for upload, which is higher than 100 megabytes (MB) per second download and 50MB upload offered by 4G network,\u201d it said\n\nThe panel allayed fears of health concerns, propelled by \u201cmisconceptions, disinformation, misinformation and malinformation\u201d.\n\nThe panel informed the participants that the apprehension was unnecessary. It cited research-based evidence from the World Health Organization (WHO), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the International Commission on Non-Ironising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), to prove the safety of 5G network to human health.\n\nThe panel explicated further that Nigeria can indeed begin to create smart cities, an ecosystem powered by 5G applications. The massive speed of 5G, according to the discussants, will also enhance the capacity of start-ups and other tech entrepreneurs to leverage the enabling environment powered by the fast connectivity, to develop unlimited solutions for the benefit of Nigeria and her citizens.\n\nAccording to the panel, an enhanced broadband that allows low latency and facilitate billion of connections in machine-to-machine communication certainly holds a big promise for socio-economic growth and development.\n\nWhen asked if the country was ready for 5G, the panel declared that, \u201cNigeria is ready for 5G because the NCC has been supported by key stakeholders to make Nigeria ready.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has built the regulatory foundation, the deployment plan has been designed and various exercises have been carried out up to the level of handling over 5G Spectrum licences to the operators.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the panelists also emphasized the centrality of collaboration among state and non-state actors to drive the ecosystem. They contend that, as with other previous technologies, such as 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G, efforts must be made for all stakeholders to glean and exploit the massive use cases of 5G for socio-economic development.\n\nWhile rounding off the highly engaging session, the moderator thanked the co-panelists for their diligence and painstaking engagements, and the audience for its interest, enthusiasm and solidarity.\n\nHe reiterated the unflinching commitment of NCC to doing all within its regulatory powers to ensure data security and data protection.\n\nHe also underscored the need for sustenance of collaborative efforts among tiers of government and all other stakeholders to ensure effective utilization of 5G services across all sectors.\n\nThe well-attended panel discussion, which focused on, \u201cMoving Forward Steadily: Socio-Economic Significance of Development of 5G Services\u201d was moderated by NCC\u2019s Head of Online Media, Dr. Omoniyi Ibietan.\n\nOther panelists were: Babagana Digima, Team Lead, Nigeria Office for Developing the Indigenous Telecoms Sector (NODITS); Usman Aliyu, Head, Space Services; Anthony Ikemefuna, Head, Fixed Networks and Converged Services; and a Senior Manager in the Legal and Regulatory Services Department of the Commission, Dr. Mohammed Suleh-Yusuf.\n\nThe AfricaNXT Conference is the largest assemblage of innovators from across Africa and Africa\u2019s Diasporan communities. Formerly known as Social Media Week Lagos, the confab and festival, now in its 10th Year, is an annual event that takes place in Lagos, focusing on harnessing Africa\u2019s potentials for her development, using the dual agencies of human creativity and the promises of technology.",
          "summary": "The NCC team explained to the excited audience how 5G will power a plethora of applications, innovation and creativity.\nWhile explaining the security, safety and speed characteristic of 5G, the panel reasoned that, while 4G has a response time of 10 millisecond, equivalent of the capacity of human brain, 5G network is even faster.\nWhen asked if the country was ready for 5G, the panel declared that, \u201cNigeria is ready for 5G because the NCC has been supported by key stakeholders to make Nigeria ready.\nHe also underscored the need for sustenance of collaborative efforts among tiers of government and all other stakeholders to ensure effective utilization of 5G services across all sectors.\nThe well-attended panel discussion, which focused on, \u201cMoving Forward Steadily: Socio-Economic Significance of Development of 5G Services\u201d was moderated by NCC\u2019s Head of Online Media, Dr. Omoniyi Ibietan.",

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun has called on the youths to imbibe the courageous and patriotic spirit of the legendary Lisabi and shun cultism and money rituals.\n\nHe also charged them to inculcate the core values of hard work, perseverance, diligence and all the positive values which form the embodiment of the spirit of Omoluabi in themselves, which the Ogun people are reputed for.\n\nAbiodun gave this charge while speaking at the grand finale of the 2022 Lisabi Day celebration, held at the Ake Palace Ground, on Saturday.\n\nThe Governor, who expressed his worries over what he termed \u201cget-rich quick syndrome\u201d among the youth, stressed that \u201call of us have a responsibility to inculcate in our youth the core values of hard-work, perseverance, diligence and all the positive values which form the embodiment of the spirit of Omoluabi. Our youth should shun cultism, money rituals and all other anti social behavior.\n\n\u201cWe must all learn from what Lisabi lived for and continue to propagate that for the development of Egbaland in particular and Ogun state in general.\u201d\n\nThe Governor noted that Lisabi as a fearless warrior and liberator of the Egba people had become the whole essence of Egbaland, describing the annual celebration as a memorial of the great exploits of a community leader, selfless soldier and emancipator of his people.\n\nAccording to Abiodun, Lisabi remained a personification of inclusiveness, justice, fairness, equity, perseverance, and self-sacrifice, noting celebrating the legend is also a celebration of the enviable ancestry, rich history, outstanding qualities and the greatness of the Egba people.\n\nHe pointed out that the unique experience and privileged position of the Egba as early beneficiaries of western education have enabled them to be at the forefront in many fields of human endeavour and to continuously play leadership roles in the socio-economic and political life of the nation.\n\nWhile congratulating the Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo and the entire people of Egbaland, the Governor posited that the enviable legacy of Lisabi should serve to propel the people to greater achievements in their individual and collective pursuits.\n\nHe thanked the people of Egbaland for their support, cooperation, prayers and collaborations since his emergence as the candidate of our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), till date, assuring his administration would continue to espouse developmental projects across the state equitably.\n\nWhile noting that Egbaland had continued to be the major beneficiary of the concentration of major projects initiated both by his administration and the previous administrations, Abiodun said four out of the five legacy projects commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari are located in Egbaland.\n\n\u201cThe City Gate Monument to which serves as a befitting welcome to Abeokuta, the State Capital; the Abeokuta-Siun-InterChange Express road; the Kobape Housing Estate, and the King\u2019s Court Housing Estate at Oke-Mosan are located in Ogun Central.\n\n\u201cWe have renovated 41 schools in Ogun Central in the first phase of our rehabilitation plan of schools in Ogun State. More so, most of our agriculture programmes take place in Odeda, in Egbaland. The Odeda farm Institute hosts many of young farmers who are being trained to take advantage of our robust agriculture and agric-business schemes.\n\n\u201cIn all, the above is to show that Egbaland and its people remain vital in our development programme for Ogun State.\n\n\u201cFor Abeokuta, in particular, we have a special plan that will continue to place the city in a vantage position as a befitting capital city like its contemporaries all over the world. Abeokuta has been chosen among the 15 towns as the new city. This is a United Kingdom Project as part of our Public-Private Partnership (PPP).\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, we will be launching the Mass Transit Bus which will take off in Abeokuta very soon. That mass transit will be a revolution to road public transportation not only in Ogun State but in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is also our promise that any inherited projects that have bearing and will impact the development of our dear State will not be abandoned. In fact, those that could no longer be used for their initial purposes will be converted to the advantage of our dear State. An example is the conversion of the Model School at Kobape road into the Ogun Tech Hub. I am happy to report that the Ogun Tech Hub has been fully utilized by our youth as an infrastructural support for young innovators, and incubation for tech-based start up.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I enjoin all our people to take ownership of these projects. This is the only way that we will ensure that these projects serve the purposes they are executed. Let me also call on all Egba sons and daughters to take concrete steps in charting a new and improved course for the development of Egbaland in particular, and Ogun State in general,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nHe, however, called on the people to pay attention to the issue of security, submitting that \u201cwe must all understand that security is a task for all us. We must also appreciate that it is only in a secured and safe environment that development can take place\u201d.",

          "text": "Missing Bamise was going to brother\u2019s house on surprise visit \u2013 Sister\n\nDevastated family members lament mysterious disappearance\n\nSay police have arrested guarantors of bus driver\n\nThe family of Oluwabamise Ayanwola, the 22-year-old female fashion designer whose whereabouts became unknown after she boarded a Lagos State Government owned BRT bus from Chevron Estate in Ajah on her way to Oshodi on February 26, is in deep sorrow over the incident.\n\nIn a chat with our correspondent yesterday, Bamise\u2019s sibling, Elizabeth, lamented alleged abduction of her sister by the driver of the bus, identified as Nice Andrew Omininikoron.\n\nAlthough the operators of the bus said they were awaiting the outcome of police investigation into the matter, the driver, The Nation learnt, was still at large.\n\nElizabeth told our correspondent yesterday that her missing sister was heading to the brother\u2019s house at Ikotun to stay with the wife who was in \u2018labour\u2019.\n\nShe reportedly boarded the bus with number 240257 at 7:30pm and became suspicious when the driver told her to sit at one of the back seats.\n\nBamise\u2019s last movement\n\nNarrating her sister\u2019s last movement, Elizabeth said: \u201cOn Saturday evening (February 26), my sister closed at 7 pm. She normally had breaks on Sundays. She works at Ajah as a fashion designer and normally works from Monday to Saturday.\n\n\u201cSo when she closed on Saturday (February 26), she wanted to go to my brother\u2019s house because his wife was in labour. My brother stays at Ikotun (a Lagos suburb).\n\n\u201cMy missing sister\u2019s house is in Ogun State, Ota precisely. She stays with our aunt who is the first born.\n\n\u201cShe called my brother three days before then that she would be coming but she did not know when. On the day she left Ajah, she wanted to surprise my brother by not telling him that she was already on her way.\n\n\u201cShe boarded a bus from Chevron Bus Stop. When she entered the BRT bus, it was only her, and there was no light inside the bus.\n\n\u201cShe had felt safe inside the BRT bus since it is a popular state bus, but she wondered why it was only her that was in the bus and the driver didn\u2019t pick any other passenger.\n\n\u201cShe was even conversing with a colleague of hers because she felt unsafe. She was sending voice notes to her friend. Her friend advised her to drop since the driver didn\u2019t pick up any other passenger.\n\n\u201cBefore entering, she informed her friend that the driver was passing some remarks at her but she did n\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cSo later on, the driver later picked up three people on the road: two men and a lady. Then she now felt calm.\n\n\u201cBefore the driver picked the three other persons who had disguised as passengers, she made several videos of the bus and the driver and sent it to her friend. The video captured the bus number. It helped us in tracking the bus.\n\n\u201cHer phone was not low. It is a new phone she just bought three weeks ago. Her friend chatted with her several times, but she didn\u2019t reply.\n\n\u201cShe tried calling her via normal call a few minutes to 8 pm, but she didn\u2019t pick up.\n\n\u201cAround 7:32 pm, she posted \u2018God, it is your protection I need\u2019 on her Whatsapp status.\n\n\u201cI saw the status but I didn\u2019t see it on time because I was not online.\n\n\u201cAfter repeated calls, her friend said she heard some voices underneath trying to struggle to get the phone from her.\u201d\n\nDistraught mother\n\nAs would be expected, Bamise\u2019s mother of 10 \u2014 five boys and five girls \u2014 has been seriously disturbed since her daughter went missing. In one of the viral videos seen by The Nation, the distraught mother was seen wailing in front of a bus numbered 240257, at one of the terminals of LBSL, said to be the bus Bamise had boarded.\n\n\u201cThis is the vehicle that Bamise boarded. It has been parked. They say they cannot find the driver. Bamise boarded the vehicle at Ajah and said she was going to Oshodi. \u201cThe vehicle got to its destination but the child did not get home. We can\u2019t find her. They must find Bamise for me. I didn\u2019t tell her to go to Lagos to die.\u201d\n\n\u2018How her friend alerted us about her plight\u2019\n\nAsked how the family learnt about Bamise\u2019s plight, Elizabeth said: \u201cIt was her friend who was chatting with her that alerted us.\n\n\u201cShe called one of my brothers to ask for her whereabouts, but he said he had not seen her.\n\n\u201cI was even in church when they told me that they could not reach her.\n\n\u201cMy sister is someone I can vouch for because she is focused and determined. I\u2019ve been crying because I am devastated.\n\n\u201cSince the day she went missing, we\u2019ve been going around different stations. We tracked the driver and the phone number of my sister.\n\n\u201cWhen we tracked it independently of the police, we tracked it down to Oshodi terminal station. When we got there, they didn\u2019t answer us properly.\n\n\u201cWe were told the driver was supposed to resume by 2 pm, but we didn\u2019t know he was around and we were there till 3/4pm.\n\n\u201cWe later learnt the following day that the driver was around but took to his heels when he learnt that there was trouble.\n\n\u201cWe went to Maroko and Ajah police stations to lodge complaints and we\u2019ve been shuffling through these stations.\n\n\u201cWe had to look for his guarantors. After locating one of his guarantors, we were told by the elder brother of the guarantor that his junior brother was not aware he was being used as a guarantor.\n\n\u201cThe other guarantor stays at Ekoro axis, while the other stays at Ikoyi axis. They\u2019ve been arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken with the Commissioner of Police. He had a phone call meeting with the terminal operators and the family to ask for questions that would aid investigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sent SOS to the governor for about four days but there is no response. We\u2019ve even gone on social media but the government has not given an audience.\n\n\u201cAll I want is for my sister to be found. We were told to write a letter to the terminal but they refused us access.\n\n\u201cThe police are not taking this issue for granted; they are putting themselves in our shoes because they are handling the case properly\u201d\n\nLast location tracked\n\nAccording to Elizabeth, the family made an attempt to track the driver\u2019s location and it showed through his phone that he was two streets away from where her missing sister is.\n\n\u201cThe last location of the phone tracked is in Ogun State, but the driver is currently on the run.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the bus that is directly involved in this whole issue is still operating. This is insensitive.\n\n\u201cEveryone has been disturbed since Saturday that she went missing. The whole family is devastated. We need God\u2019s intervention. I have been fasting and praying.\u201d\n\nMatter under investigation\n\nWhen The Nation visited the Oshodi terminal on Saturday, normal operations were ongoing with various buses loading commuters for various destinations.\n\nA staff at the terminal, who did not want to be named, said the Oshodi bus terminal is where BRT buses usually load to various destinations and that the family had been directed to Lagos Bus Services Limited where the case would be handled.\n\nHe however noted that the terminal operators had escalated the matter because the issue became a stain on the terminal.\n\n\u201cWhen the family came, they were angry and wanted to create a scene. I now advised them to go to LBS where the matter would be handled, so they are on it.\n\n\u201cThe police are investigating too\u201d.\n\nThe Nation learnt that Bamise\u2019s family had held a meeting with the Lagos Bus Service Ltd. (LBSL), operators of BRT, on Wednesday, March 2, and the latter assured that efforts were being made to track down the driver.\n\nPolice spokesman in Lagos, Adekunle Ajisebutu, who confirmed the incident, said it was under investigation.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has directed that no stone should be left unturned to locate her whereabouts. Search parties have also been organised,\u201d Ajisebutu said.",

          "title": "2022 International Women Day: Nigerian women berate NASS",
          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu and Christy Anyanwu\n\nNot a few people exchanged messages of goodwill on Tuesday, March 1, as they wished one another \u201cHappy New Month\u201d via SMS and on various social media platforms. But at the National Assembly, a wholly different situation was brewing for the Nigerian women.\n\nWhen the two chambers of the National Assembly convened to vote on the bills amending several provisions of the Constitution, civil society organisations and many other interest groups that had advocated for specific amendments waited with bated breath, anticipating endorsement of the amendments they championed.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBy the time the votes were cast, Nigerian women were left in shock as the major bills that pertained to, and were of great interest to them were literally thrown into the legislative trash cans of the two chambers of the 9th National Assembly.\n\nReacting to the news, a Senior Lecturer at Bells University of Technology, Dr (Mrs) Nkiru Ifekwem, who is also a gender expert and public analyst, characterised what transpired on the floors of the Senate and House of Representative on that fateful March 1 as the annihilation of women in Nigeria, in a year when the theme for the 2022 International Women Day, marked annually on March 8 is, \u201cTime to Break the Bias.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to comment on the readiness of women to break the bias against them, Dr Ifekwem retorted: \u201cHow can we say that women are ready to break the bias when the women that most Nigerian women look up were in Dubai, instead of being at the National Assembly on the day women in Nigeria were being annihilated in the name of constitutional amendment?\u201d\n\nPrior to the final vote on the proposed constitutional amendments, the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari had led a special delegation comprising the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen and other notable women to the floors of the two legislative chambers of the National Assembly to observe their special plenary sessions, in demonstration of her personal support and commitment to seeing the women-centric bills become part of the amendments to the constitution.\n\nAmong the issues of major concern to women were: reserving specific seats for women in the National Assembly, giving citizenship to the foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman, allowing women to become indigenes of their husband\u2019s state of origin after five years of being together, 35 per cent appointed positions for women and women 35 per cent affirmative action in party administration and leadership.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nIn a very real sense, the visit of the First Lady and earlier efforts ultimately did not sway the legislators as all the issues so dear to the heart of Nigerian women were thrown out by the National Assembly, which incidentally had only a five per cent female membership.\n\nWithout doubt, women have always faced gender bias, which Ifekwem explained as \u201cbehaviour that shows favouritism towards one gender over another,\u201d noting that it is a common stance in this part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge or rather it is obvious that men and boys are favoured over women and girls.\n\n\u201cYou see, having a baby boy seems a greater achievement than a baby girl even when it is a fact that girls take care of their aged parents more than boys. We normally hear that someone had a bouncing baby boy as if a baby girl doesn\u2019t bounce. Remember the advert, \u2018Mama, na boy\u2019, which a GSM telecommunication company once ran several years ago. Female activists fought to stop further broadcast of the television commercial as it was considered discriminatory to the baby girl. In spite of the little improvement we have in the gender space, there is still bias, stereotyping and discrimination against women.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that women in Nigeria have not shown enough readiness to break the bias. Women are still caught up with so many frivolities instead of the main issues that affect them. Talk of intra-gender animosity, women in different spheres of life still fight with each other instead of supporting each other for growth; there is much pettiness and unnecessary envy.\u201d\n\nIn Ifekwem\u2019s view, the National Assembly clearly indicated that women in Nigeria are irrelevant.\n\n\u201cWe are looking out to see if the women agree that they are. Going through history, I feel for the women that laid their lives for us during the Aba Women Riot over 90 years ago. With all our education now, the technology, the awareness and globalisation, Nigeria is still the way it is today and we women are not ready to sacrifice the way our less educated sisters did 90 years ago. The likes of Margaret Ekpo and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti are definitely disappointed with us in their grave. They can never believe that there are only seven female senators out of 109 members and 12 female House of Representatives members out of 360 members in the 9th assembly and Nigeria has never had a female governor except the opportune and accidental case of Mrs Virgy Etiaba, who became governor after Peter Obi got impeached in Anambra State,\u201d she said with an obvious sad tone.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe pain of Ifekwem is shared by Prof Remi Sonaiya, a politician, educationist and writer. She was the only female presidential candidate in 2015 general election on the platform of KOWA Party.\n\nContextualising the bias which she strongly believes was shown to women by NASS, Sonaiya said: \u201cI was actually thinking that we have been talking about bad treatment meted out to Nigerian citizens in Ukraine, the racism against them in that they were not allowed to board buses in the wake of the Russian invasion to get to the border of Poland. When such things happened members of the National Assembly were angry, saying they could not tolerate that kind of treatment. But what they did against the women is it not the same thing? Is it not the same act of discrimination; is it not the same refusal to recognize the humanness? They are practicing the same thing: gender discrimination and gender bias.\u201d\n\nDealing with bias\n\nVice Chairperson, Commonwealth Businesses Women Network and Chief Executive/Boardchair, Strategic Women and Youth Institute (SWYI), Mrs Ngozi Oyewole, is one resourceful female person that has mastered the art of confronting and overcoming barriers placed in her way.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs an entrepreneur I am always happy to tell my story and the barriers I face every time, and how I overcome them. Like they say your story is your strength and be shameless about the hustle.\n\n\u201cOffice furniture manufacturing is thought to be a male-dominated industry, but I thrive very well and pounding the ground even harder than the men. What I face is a Catch-22 situation sometimes, where some are biased and display stereotyped behaviour and the implicit association with the entrepreneur\u2019s business competency, especially when they say \u2018don\u2019t pitch like a girl\u2019 \u2013 this driven by stereotypes based on gender role expectations for men and women. In my case, a woman entrepreneur playing in a male dominated area such as mine, is considered overly assertive, viewed negatively, and will experience career backlash.\n\n\u201cSo, women entrepreneurs who disrupt gender norms by adopting masculine-stereotyped behaviour are likely to lose approval and be negatively perceived by others. This then creates roadblocks for them. This is very common when seeking growth capital, where the women suffer from investor perceptions as a female entrepreneur instead of looking into their preferences for the venture.\n\n\u201cSo, women experience a greater difficulty in obtaining funding for their businesses because the investors perceive women-led businesses as less legitimate, riskier and competency deficient. Because of these discriminatory practices women entrepreneurs face, a lot of women are discouraged and cannot even take off from ground zero.\n\n\u201cIn the early stages of my entrepreneurial journey where I had to pitch for funds for my business, I was poorly served because I was perceived as inferior to men in terms of having the necessary abilities to lead a business, because I was expected to display communal traits to fulfill my female gender role as a nurturer, which is in contrast to the leadership role\u2019s requirement for energetic traits.\n\n\u201cI sat back and looked inwards, got myself well equipped to face the battle and realized that gender bias cannot be killed by fire, but by knowledge! I embarked on self-development, got myself a coach, grew my confidence, expanded my knowledge, through networking by joining social organizations, increased my net-worth and today here I am.\u201d\n\nOn the way forward, to achieve the desire of women in the Nigerian polity, Sonaiya counselled that the womenfolk need the cooperation of the men, to attain the increase in the number of women participating in politics.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t give up,\u201d she said with dogged confidence of a fighter.",
          "summary": "But at the National Assembly, a wholly different situation was brewing for the Nigerian women.\n\u201cI can assure you that women in Nigeria have not shown enough readiness to break the bias.\nWhen such things happened members of the National Assembly were angry, saying they could not tolerate that kind of treatment.\nBecause of these discriminatory practices women entrepreneurs face, a lot of women are discouraged and cannot even take off from ground zero.\n\u201cI sat back and looked inwards, got myself well equipped to face the battle and realized that gender bias cannot be killed by fire, but by knowledge!",

          "text": "By Tosin Ajirire\n\nEwomaoghene Luther-Abegunde a.k.a Elwoma is a blend of grace and gifts. The singer, songwriter and movie marketing executive is the voice behind several popular songs including Unforgiveness and A King Is Born, which recently earned her nominations in two categories in BAGMA, an international gospel music award.\n\nElwoma\u2019s recent releases such as Oseme, More than Christmas and Jehovah Bankable are being played and downloaded daily on global streaming platforms like Spotify, Boomplay, iTunes, Audiomack and Pandora.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIn this chat, the mother of three opens up on why she\u2019s been regarded as the voice of hope and inspiration to her world. Please enjoy it.\n\nWhat motivated you to be a gospel singer?\n\nI would like to state that I wasn\u2019t motivated to be a gospel singer; rather being a gospel singer is part of fulfilling my God-given purpose here on earth. Being a gospel singer is my expression of love to God, and an extension of sharing this love with the world. When you are in love with someone, you don\u2019t need any motivation to express or show off that love.\n\nYour new single, Beautiful is Your Name, is highly rhythmic and powerfully rendered. What inspired it?\n\nBeautiful is Your Name was borne out of an experience in 2020. I host a weekly Instagram programme called \u2018Fun/True Facts Behind the Songs We Sing\u2019. On this programme, I interview gospel artistes across the globe and they talk about the inspiration behind their songs, their walk with God and people, challenges faced and the likes. On one of those days, I interviewed Bukola Bekes, and the presence of God was so strong and tangible that after we logged off, I went straight to my bedroom, knelt down and started weeping in worship before God. All I kept muttering was \u2018beautiful is your name\u2019, \u2018beautiful is your name\u2019. Then it became a song and I kept singing those words. Two years later, here we are with the song being recorded and now ready for release. I am just in awe of God\u2019s goodness.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nWhen are you dropping the song and on which label or streaming platform?\n\nThe audio has been released on February 25 on all digital platforms \u2013 Boomplay, iTunes, Audiomack, Spotify and Pandora etc. And this will be followed by the song\u2019s video, which will premiere on my YouTube channel @elwoma\n\nHow does music come to you?\n\nThere is no one way music comes to me. I could be listening to the sound of the piano and inspiration would come. It could come in the place of studying the Bible or praying or during rehearsal with the choir in my home church.\n\nI remember when my dad died last year; I wrote some of the songs that would be released in my sophomore album. During that grieving time, I needed the comfort that only God could give, and the songs kept coming. Also, I wrote Living Water, another song in my upcoming album while in Lagos traffic, jingling my house keys. Beautiful is Your Name and Jehovah Bankable, which I released last year, came out of an Instagram live experience. And at other times, I deliberately sit down to write songs. For example, when my friends want me to sing at their wedding ceremonies, I have to compose songs for them. And I also do collaborate with other songwriters.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWhat do you think is unique about you or your music?\n\nI am an inspiring human being on a mission to impact the world, with all that God has inhaled in me. I am a wife and mother of three amazing children, and I serve my generation as a hope merchant.\n\nHow do you combine music with your job at Silverbird Film Distribution?\n\nIt is a matter of creating the balance. For example, for two consecutive years, I sang the national anthem at my company\u2019s event, \u2018Silverbird Man of The Year Award\u2019. So, they are aware I sing. When it is time to do my official work, I give it my best shot; and when it is time to do my music, I also give it my all. It is a matter of knowing what to do at the appropriate time.\n\nGiven the opportunity, would you consider pursuing music professionally?\n\nThat\u2019s a very tricky question; but I can tell you that professionally, I am currently doing music.\n\nWho are your mentors in gospel music both locally and internationally?\n\nMy mentors are Sinach, Yolanda Adams and Cece Winnas. I love African American singers; they inspire my style of singing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after Beautiful Is Your Name?\n\nBeautiful Is Your Name is off my sophomore album. By the grace of God, I will be releasing more songs from the album this year, until the full work is ready. So, expect more music as we make Jesus global, giving hope to our world.\n\nAs a gospel singer, where do you see yourself in the next five years?\n\nIn the next five years, I see myself bringing home the Grammys, with more music, more albums. I see myself carrying out pet projects that inspire lives in the city, rural areas, and also doing lots of collaboration that will impact lives whilst carrying out God\u2019s kingdom assignment across the globe, beginning from Nigeria.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer Spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Yekini Nabena, has always been blunt in his views about anything.\n\nLittle wonder in this chat with Sunday Sun, Nabena did not only admonish his kinsman and former President Goodluck Jonathan, not to dent his reputation by falling to the trap to contest the 2023 presidential election under APC, but also frowned at the continued election of ex-governors as APC chairmen.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nHe speaks on other political issues, especially as it concerns his party, the APC, what Nigerian youths must do to wrest power from the older politicians, among others.\n\nWhat is the assurance to party members that APC will not implode after the convention?\n\nNigerians don\u2019t need to be worried about postponing the national convention of our party. The chairman, Caretaker Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, is not relenting. You can see that each time we postpone our convention, a good thing is about to happen. Although there are no plans to postpone the March 26 date, I can also tell you that two governors are about to join the APC. Let me emphasize that two serving PDP governors will soon join the APC before or after our convention or latest before the general elections. Resolving the zoning arrangements is not a big deal. I also want to dismiss the speculations that our party will implode after our convention. It will not happen. All these speculations are fuelled by people with selfish interests. They are coming from people who want to remain relevant in the party. Most of the persons making noise and predicting implosion doom for the party are those that want to be carried along. Haven been with the party in government, they don\u2019t want to be left out. Some of them want to make noise to be part of the government and to be on the sharing table. The party will not implode after our convention. One thing you need to understand is that in every exchange of batons, there is bound to be some crisis because whoever is coming is bound to upset the status-quo by coming with his own people. People who want to belong at all costs are the ones responsible for the impression in many quarters that the party is in serious crisis. Come to think of it, APC is a moving train that nobody can stop. That two governors are joining the APC from the PDP is a confirmation that the ruling party is a moving train. I still maintain that there is no reason to be afraid of anything like the implosion of the party before, during or after our convention. Whoever that is nursing such thought should perish it because it is not going to happen. Yes, I understand the fears of those that want to make noise and be carried along because haven been in government, they don\u2019t want to see themselves outside the government. They want to cause crisis so that they can come to the sharing table to continue benefitting. Otherwise, if they feel so popular, why can\u2019t they float a political party where they will exercise overwhelming influence? But because they want to be on the sharing table, they decided to stay with the APC and cause confusion.\n\nWho is actually in charge of the APC, President Buhari, the governors or the Caretaker Committee?\n\nThe President is undoubtedly the leader of our party and should expectedly have an overwhelming element of control in the affairs of the party. Members of the APC Progressive Governors Forum are also strong stakeholders and do meet from time to time to discuss and take a stand on issues concerning the party. The Caretaker Committee, for me, oversees the day-to-day running of the party. In most cases, that is why it has been easy to make acceptable decisions.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nJudging by the agreement to swap the national offices between South and North, how sure are you that the presidential ticket will not tear the Southerners apart, especially micro-zoning it?\n\nI don\u2019t think so and I don\u2019t see the reason it should tear them apart. I know that ambitions will certainly clash but I always believe in the supremacy of the party. Once the party makes a decision on the zone to get the ticket and even decide on micro-zoning it, everybody at that particular point will have to sacrifice their individual ambitions in compliance with the decision of the party and support the anointed person. We must always know that it is only God that gives power because no single individual can make himself president of this country or elsewhere in the world. Anybody can get angry over the decision of the party, but will be left with no other option than to comply. Everybody must queue to join the moving train. However, let me say that the permutations of the viability of which zone is competent enough to produce the next president is better discussed when the party takes the decision on it. We will cross the bridge when we get to the river. We must learn to take one step at a time, not rushing it. We have to finish our convention and go into the primary before knowing which zone will produce the next presidential candidate.\n\nWhat is giving you the confidence that APC will retain the presidential seat beyond 2023 especially with the volume of crisis rocking the party?\n\nLet me reiterate what I said earlier that there is no crisis in the APC. I should, however, admit that even in a very small family, there is still little misunderstanding. The noise many are misinterpreting as a crisis is coming from people wanting to belong. On your question on confidence, I can tell you that APC has worked very hard and we are trusting Nigerians to still vote for us massively as they did previously. If there is crisis in APC as many claimed, how come it performed very well in the recently concluded bye-elections? APC performed well even in a state like Cross River where they believed that the governor is a pushover. What I can tell you for free is that PDP will not pose any challenge that will be of serious threat to the APC in the 2023 general elections.\n\nDid anyone among those that have declared interest to contest the 2023 presidential election come to you as a surprise?\n\nMy concern is that most of them are people who have gotten to the limit of their political career. Some have been ministers, governors, and legislators with the desperation that if they don\u2019t do it now, they may not have the opportunity to do it again. Somebody like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has become everything, but age is catching up with him. It does not call for desperation but don\u2019t forget that everybody has his own style of doing things. All I advise them is to know that it is only God that gives power.\n\nDid the recurring issue of Jonathan contesting with even the recent report that APC will give him an automatic ticket come to you as a surprise?\n\nThis is time for him to speak up if he is man enough. He should graduate beyond people speaking for him. Nigeria has passed the stage that he wants the ticket delivered at his doorstep. However, if you ask me I will still say that it is not right or ideal for Jonathan to contest again. It will be so selfish of Jonathan to contest again just to do a tenure because it will be a disservice to the South. In fact, I don\u2019t know what Jonathan forgot at Aso Rock that he is coming back to pick there by contesting as president. What is he going to fix in four years that he could not fix in six years? He will not have time to solve security, economy and political challenges facing the country today. He should resist the temptation, be the Goodluck and statesman everybody knows him for and not come out to dent his little reputation.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIs it true that Timpre Sylva will be contesting for president in 2023?\n\nI have not heard about him contesting, but if Mr President anoints him to succeed him, so be it. He is eminently qualified to contest, having been tested in one way and the other. However, only God gives power and as a party man, I will abide by the decision of my party if he emerges as our party\u2019s candidate.\n\nHow would you rate the Caretaker Committee after being shrouded in one controversy or the other?\n\nAnybody who claims that the Caretaker Committee didn\u2019t help the party must be an enemy. What people must know is that approaches to leadership differ. No two leaders can operate on the same frequency. APC has recorded many successes under this Caretaker Committee. It is not easy to drag sitting governors into running a party. The Caretaker Committee chairman is a target-driven, straightforward, peaceful person. Look at the calibre of sitting governors and politicians he has attracted to the party.\n\nAre you saying that the performance of the Caretaker Committee has justified the sacking of the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led NWC?\n\nIt is wrong to claim that the performance of the Caretaker Committee has justified the sacking of Oshiomhole. But you ought to know that once there is a gang up against someone, it may be impossible to survive it. The problem with Oshiomhole was very simple. Most of the governors facing serious fear of unknown for the 2023 elections were behind his travails by ganging up against him. Oshiomhole is an independent-minded person who cannot be easily intimidated.\n\nWhat is your impression about those aspiring for the position of the National Chairman of the party?\n\nHaving tried past governors as our chairmen in the past from the beginning of the party, I will suggest that the party must change that pattern and try something different instead of the old format of appointing former governors. Most of the former governors have heavy baggage with their cases in EFCC or ICPC, including most of the current aspirants. We should rather go for an aspirant with integrity, sound and focused person, and good enough to drive the party. However, if the party leaders insist on the old style, I will gladly obey as a party man.\n\nAre you planning to be part of the about to be constituted NWC?\n\nIt is zoning that will determine where my political pendulum will swing to. Everything will depend on the party\u2019s zoning arrangements. And the zoning will decide my next move. However, I want to emphasise that fairness and equity demand that the party\u2019s leadership should consider other states like Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom and Delta in micro-zoning the positions for the South-south. Edo State has produced party chairmen, Cross River has also produced National Vice Chairman twice in the person of Hillard Eta, the same with Rivers who has produced Assistant National Secretary twice in the persons of Ambassador Ngofia and Victor Giadom.\n\nWill you support the call for a paradigm shift from the elders to youths for the 2023 presidency?\n\nWe should be looking for independent youths that will not go cap in hand to beg the old politicians to lend them the required fund. No old politician will bankroll the youths with his funds to retire him. If only the youths can reduce the money they spend on frivolities like clubbing and merriments, buying nomination forms and even funding their elections will not be a problem. They need to be independent minded if they will stand the chance to wrest power from the old politicians.\n\nWhat is the level of peace in the APC Bayelsa State chapter?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I don\u2019t think there is a problem in Bayelsa State APC. I hear people claim that there is faction, but I can tell you that there is none. You said that David Lyon is not in the same camp with Sylva, but who is Lyon in the APC? Yes, he was given a governorship ticket, but anybody the party fielded would have won that election. If we have factions as you claimed, do we have two party chairmen in the state? We rather have people who feel they can get the position through the court to impose their brothers on others. They cannot succeed in their plans. Before Lyon claims to be a leader, how much has he contributed to the party at the centre. Leadership is not about collecting sitting allowances from the party without contributing anything to promote the state chapter of the party. I challenge him to come and contest again to test his popularity.",

          "text": "But oil multinational sold all its shares, not JV assets to Seplat\n\nNOC\u2019s action opens up possible legal tussle\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt from officials NNPC, that the state-owned oil giant has opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous said last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued.\n\nSeplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoken on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NDLEA to arraign suspended \u2018super cop,\u2019 four IRT members on eight counts of drug trafficking\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nNDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge\n\nThe federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "*EU observer mission meets parties, stakeholders ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, dashed the hope and plans of many people, when it declared it would not register any new political parties, because they would not be able to participate in the 2023 general election by law.\n\nINEC, which claimed that the reason was because the new Electoral Act barred the registration of new political parties to participate in any general election twelve months before, added also that the same new electoral law, allowed for the merger of political parties, only nine months to the general elections.\n\nThere are currently 18 registered political parties in the country.\n\nHowever, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, called on INEC to be truly independent in the conduct of subsequent elections and not allow itself to be manipulated as was the case in 2019, which its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, claimed the opposition party won but was denied.\n\nThe PDP also called on all security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to subvert electoral processes as was done during the Federal Capital Territory and other elections in Imo and Plateau States recently.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union (EU) Election Observation Follow-up Mission, led by the Head of EU Observation Mission, Mrs Maria Arena, yesterday, hinted that it has held talks with political parties and other stakeholders ahead of next elections and would give a report of its meetings soon.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors, INEC national commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman Voters Education, Festus Okoye, reiterated that, \u201cThe Act also provides that new political association must apply for registration not later than 12 months before a general election while applications for merger must be filed not later than 9 months before election.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that registration and their participation were already time barred, Okoye said, INEC has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election, fixing Presidential and National Assembly elections to hold on the 25th of February 2023 and Governorship and State Assembly Elections to hold on the 11th of March 2023.\n\nHe said the law provided that the election funds due to the Commission for any general elections were to be released to the Commission not later than one year before the election.\n\nOkoye explained that Nigeria was entering a critical and challenging phase in its electoral process as there were new, creative and progressive provisions and innovations in the new law, adding: \u201cThe law has tight timelines that must be carefully managed.\n\nUnder the new law, the Commission shall issue the Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the date fixed for the conduct of elections. Political parties must submit the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates not later than 180 days before the election.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the new law contained such new provisions relating to ballot boxes and voting devices, accreditation of voters, determination of over-voting, visually impaired and incapacitated voters, post-election procedure and collation of election results.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cIt also contains power of the Commission to review declared results, nomination of candidates, limitation of election expenses and the jurisdiction of courts in pre-election matters among other provisions.\u201d\n\nHe called on the media to isolate and analyse these provisions and thereafter treat the entire law as a compound package for the conduct of elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, he said a good knowledge of the law and its provisions would assist in crafting good editorials and holding the Commission and the Political Parties accountable to their implementation.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election. Growing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of internally displaced persons will pose challenges to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo many of the internally displaced persons are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voters Cards and it is next to impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cThis is because section 47(1) of the Electoral Act clearly provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding Officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their Permanent Voters Cards. While it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP camps), it is next to impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations,\u201d he stated\n\nIn view of this, Okoye said, \u201cFor the internally displaced, the Commission will print new Permanent Voters Cards for them and recreate their polling units in their camps and they will be eligible to vote in some of the elections depending on their location and their proximity to their State and Federal Constituencies.\n\n\u201cThis is in accord with section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides that, \u2018In the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cBased on this, the Commission developed regulations and guidelines on IDP voting and will implement the intendment of the law and the Regulations and Guidelines,\u201d he disclosed\n\nOkoye hinted that the Commission was currently at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR), as there were so many communities that were still inaccessible to INEC registration officers.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe stated said that it was important for the media to continue to highlight and analyse the causes and possible solutions to the security challenges in the country and continue to hold government accountable.\n\nHe equally explained that the various security agencies must try as much as possible to degrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country, adding that voting and the exercise of democratic mandate might not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\n\nOn the innovations in the Commission, he said. \u201cAs some of you are aware, the Commission has introduced new and creative changes in the enumeration of voters, the party nomination processes and the conduct of elections. The Commission is currently conducting the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR) both physically and online using the new INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has introduced an online nomination portal through which Political Parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates. The Commission has also introduced an online portal through which international and domestic observers and the media apply for accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation and authentication. The Commission introduced the INEC Result Viewing Portal (iRev) through which polling unit level results are uploaded to a result-viewing portal in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is firmly of the view that greater use of technology in the electoral process will, to a large extent, reduce human interference in the voting, counting and collation process.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye said the Commission was conscious of the fact that technology did not operate itself and that the human element is ever present, but added, that the Commission would continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology as well as innovate and improve on them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu, who spoke yesterday when the EU Observation Mission visited, maintained that the party had evidence that security agencies were used to subvert the electoral processes in the recent bye-election in some states, while charging its members to henceforth rise up and defend their votes.\n\nSpeaking at the PDP national secretariat, Ayu charged INEC to be genuinely independent to enable democracy to thrive in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP was not making flimsy excuses of the security agencies being used to subvert the electoral processes, adding, \u201cWe have the hard core evidence and we have submitted same to INEC.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP would mobilise and sensitise the voters as well as asked them to defend their votes when the need arises\n\n\u201cWe have seen a decline in those things, which were promoted as a political party, including the establishments or creating of certain institutions that will strengthen democracy in this country. And, therefore, we are very worried that those, instead of strengthening the democratic process, which will see democracy sustained, we see a sustained decline in those democratic practices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified such things like the conduct of elections, use of security services to attack judges, to attack citizens, instead of protecting them to survive the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence; I will stand by our position. We are happy that these are not just empty pronouncements, even you. You have shown to me in 2019 report, which you have read \u2013 shows clearly some of those problems that we\u2019re complaining \u2013 we\u2019ll keep complaining as long as these practices are sustained,\u201d Ayu stated .\n\nThe PDP National Chairman explained that the party had evidence that it won the 2019 general election, and lamented that justice was not done.\n\nAccording to him, it would not be good to allow such injustice to continue as was the case in the last FCT elections, where it was awarded three local governments of Abuja Municipal Area, Kuje and Bwari area councils, whereas it won 44 councillors and the APC won only 18 councillors.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral processes were subverted, because Abaji, Kwali and Gwagwalada area councils were in the rural areas of the FCT\n\nThe Head, EU Observation Mission, Arena, said the mission had been in the country meeting political parties, stakeholders and media in the last five days and would make its findings known to the public soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*First batch expected to arrive today\n\n*Ukraine says talks with Russia agreed on humanitarian corridors\n\nChinedu Eze and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe authorities of Chopin Airport, Warsaw, yesterday cancelled the evacuation flight that was expected to bring in from Poland the first batch of Nigerians that escaped the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The plane was to take off from that airport.\n\nIn continuing reactions to the conflict, particularly by Western countries and institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group yesterday declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic consequences.\n\nThe US White House yesterday announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs in President Joe Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin as the invasion of Ukraine advanced.\n\nThe flight meant to evacuate stranded Nigerians was cancelled because the aircraft overstayed its allotted duty hours. The crew that operated the Air Peace flight from Nigeria to Poland had spent their allotted hours of duty and, according to international standards, they could not exceed the allotted hours.\n\nFlight and Duty Time Limitations (FTL) recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is the rule, which ensures that aircrew fatigue does not decrease flight safety.\n\nSince most aviation incidents and accidents are result of human factors, fatigue is taken into account as a major factor, which also contributes to the human error. Therefore, fatigue of crewmembers has been an issue in civil aviation since the 1944 Chicago Convention.\n\nThe Nigerian evacuation flight was shifted to early today morning and it was expected to arrive the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, later today.\n\nAmbassador Bolaji Akinremi, who arrived Poland with the Air Peace flight, disclosed this.\n\nAkinremi explained to Arise TV, \u201cThe reality is that the flight has been rescheduled to tomorrow (Friday). The main reason is because of the delay during the check in because they have to gather them together from different hotels and by the time we would be ready after the check in, the crew that had been waiting since 9:00 am overshot their duty hour, which is allocated to them.\n\n\u201cThey have waited from 9am to 2pm. It means they have already waited five hours and they are going to have nine hours flight. That is already more than the standard allowed. So the authorities of the airport said they won\u2019t allow us to go.\n\n\u201cSo we have to come down. But arrangement has been made to ensure that we all stay together in the same hotel and we will leave very early tomorrow, 4am with the bus so that we can join the flight early.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu, who was visibly worried over the postponement of the flight, attributed the delay to the unruly behaviour of some Nigerians who could not prepare quickly to board the flight, but also expressed optimism that the flight would take off today.\n\n\u201cI am very sure by tomorrow morning the flight will take off,\u201d Ugwu said.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that before the flight was cancelled, passengers had been allowed to board and they had all been stamped after passing through security. They were already in the aircraft before the airport authorities announced the cancellation, so the evacuees had to de-board.\n\nHowever, about 1,500 Nigerians may be missing as out of the 2,222 that were received only about 600 could be accounted for.\n\nArise News reported, \u201cNigerian authorities, the Nigerian embassy here in Poland, said they only had a count of 600. But it seems at this point, there are more than 1,500 Nigerians, who are missing.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Muhammed Buhari announced the approval of $8.5 million for the evacuation of about 5, 000 Nigerians who had moved from Ukraine to neighbouring countries where they were expected to be evacuated from.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs had arranged the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries.\n\nThe chartered flights were initially arranged to depart on Wednesday, to bring the first batch of Nigerians home on Thursday.\n\nThe following Nigerians, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs records indicated that evacuees received by Nigerian embassies at Hungary were 650 persons, Poland 350 persons, Romania 940 persons and Slovakia 150 persons.\n\nThe Ministry arranged that Max Air would airlift Nigerians from Romania (560 persons), Air Peace to Poland (364 persons), and Air Peace to Poland (360) persons.\n\nThe first batch of evacuees was expected to arrive Nigeria on Thursday, March 3, 2022.\n\nIMF, World Bank Declare Support for Ukraine, Mobilise $5.2bn\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank Group declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic toll.\n\nThe Brent Wood institutions made their views known about the war that was provoked by Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine in a joint statement signed by Managing Director of IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, and the President of World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country\u2019s physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva and Malpass noted that the war was also creating significant spill overs to other countries while commodity prices were being driven higher at the risk of further fuelling inflation that hit the poor the hardest.\n\nThey said, \u201cDisruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners.\n\n\u201cOur institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures.\n\n\u201cAt the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine\u2019s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which our board could consider as early as next week.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we continue to work on Ukraine\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the World Bank Group was \u201cpreparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education.\u201d\n\nIt explained that this package would include the mobilisation of financing from several development partners, and welcomed the already-announced support from many bilateral partners.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.\u201d\n\nWhite House Announces New Sanctions on Russian Oligarchs\n\nThe White House has announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs, in Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Putin.\n\nThe new list of individuals described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cronies and their family members\u201d would be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US would be frozen, and their property would be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.\n\nAccording to the CNN, there would be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.\n\nIt included a move to target Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, \u201cone of Russia\u2019s wealthiest individuals,\u201d according to the White House, and will include his super-yacht and private jet.\n\nThe US is also sanctioning Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, whom the White House described as \u201ca top purveyor of Putin\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions \u2014 their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains,\u201d the fact sheet said.\n\nOther individuals who would be subject to full blocking sanctions are: Nikolai Tokarev (along with his wife Galina, daughter Mayya and his two luxury real estate companies); Boris Rotenberg (along with his wife Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris); Arkady Rotenberg (along with his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya); and Sergei Chemezov (along with his wife Yekaterina, his son Stanislav and stepdaughter Anastasiya).\n\nThe list also included Igor Shuvalov (along with his five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company), and Yevgeniy Prigozhin (along with his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel).\n\nThe US disclosed that it would also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.\n\nThat would target oligarchs, \u201cknown to direct, authorise, fund, significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of Russia\u2019s destabilising foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Treasury will also issue sanctions on disinformation targets. That includes SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton; SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United World International; and Geopolitical.\n\nIt will also designate \u201c26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles in these organisations, enabling the Government of the Russian Federation\u2019s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions as a part of their invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for the invasion, including harsh new sanctions and export controls aimed at imposing severe costs on the Russian economy.\n\nBiden announced on Tuesday the US would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace, joining a growing number of countries who have closed their skies to Russia. The US and its allies have also agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves.\n\nUkraine Says Talks with Russia Agreed on Humanitarian Corridors\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator said yesterday that a second round of ceasefire talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for, but the sides had reached an understanding on creating humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the two sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians.\n\n\u201cThat is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,\u201d Reuters quoted him to have said.\n\nThey had also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. It was the first time the two sides had agreed any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago.\n\nPodolyak said the outcome had fallen short of Kyiv\u2019s hopes, however.\n\n\u201cTo our great regret, we did not get the results we were counting on,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say is that we discussed the humanitarian aspect in sufficient detail, because quite a lot of cities are now surrounded. There is a dramatic situation with medicines, food, and evacuation,\u201d Podolyak said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Vault Hill is building a human-centric metaverse. What about it?",
          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely.

For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will partner the federal government on the management of the Okomu National Park, to revitalize the park and strengthen security in the area.\n\nObaseki disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the Conservator of the Okomu National Park, Mr. Augustine Obekpa, when he visited the park in Udo Community, Ovia South-West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor also stated plans to send a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration to bolster efforts at protecting the state\u2019s forest reserves.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe are going to be sending a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration next week. We will make sure that we expand the law beyond forestry assets to also cover the natural assets found around the forest.\n\n\u201cWe want to collaborate with the National Park Service. I will visit the Minister of Environment to offer her a certain proposal to allow the Edo State Government to jointly manage the park with the federal government because this is our resource.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWith that collaboration, it means that we would put in more resources. We would like to increase the number of rangers and park officers to protect not only this park but some other reserves that are around us here, particularly the Okumo Reserve and the Gelegele Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe will pay for the new hires under such an arrangement. We will upgrade your training, as well as provide more facilities and amenities for the park.\n\n\u201cNobody will come here if they don\u2019t feel secure and safe. This does not apply only to the park and the resources around this area, but it is important for people to know that they are secured when they come in to enjoy nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we improve the security of this park and expose the beauty and ecotourism opportunities of the park,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cWe have been hearing of nefarious activities of criminal elements, both in the park and the forest reserve, and also the Okomu Oil Palm Company. Today, we are on a fact finding visit to examine what exactly is going on in the park.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the number of attacks, where the attacks are coming from and see how the state government can come in and collaborate effectively with the park using the full security system in the state to deal with the security challenges that we have here.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not just sit back and allow the kind of criminality that we are seeing in this area. Our worry is that if we don\u2019t confront them now, it will get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get the full report from you and to understand clearly how the criminals are operating. We saw a truck outside the premises which I believe was recently seized with high quality wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how expensive these items are. Our concern is that these criminals come in, log illegally and take the logs out, sell them and procure more arms and come in to occupy the territory,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Conservator of the Okomu National Park said the park is home to white-throated monkeys, Buffalo and Elephants, noting that farming, hunting and illegal logging was affecting the natural habitats of the animals.\n\nObekpa appealed to the governor for logistics support to enable them to effectively protect the forest assets.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are engaging with investors in plantation agriculture so that a good cache of our forests is protected and preserved, even as they go about their businesses in a sustainable manner.\n\n\u201cWe are in partnership with stakeholders, including the Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies to preserve our forest reserve, particularly the Okomu Forest Area against criminals. This will prove critical in protecting elephants and other endangered animals in the forest. We will continue to explore even better channels to protect our endangered wildlife assets,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the UN, \u201cWorld Wildlife Day is an opportunity to celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna and flora and to raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that their conservation provides to people.

(It allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship); Deny Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage; Deny 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent; Deny women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Deny specific seats for women in the National Assembly, among others.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, we have a healthy mix of women in our cabinet, as they occupy more than 30 percent of positions of commissioners and Special Advisers in government. They provide invaluable service to ensure the proper functioning of the engine of government. At the senior cadre of the civil and public service, women make up more than 50 percent of the Permanent Secretaries, which provides them with ample opportunity to serve the people. Our experience has proven that women bring a rare knack of commitment and sense of service to drive change and engender progress like never before seen in the civil service.\n\n\u201cEdo people hope that their own representatives at the National Assembly did not vote along the lines of disenfranchising their women population because to do so will mean that they do not care about those who sent them to represent them at the Assembly.\n\nStressing that the Assembly missed a golden chance, he said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that the National Assembly members missed a golden opportunity to redesign Nigeria\u2019s political landscape by enshrining landmark legislation that promotes inclusion and provides women with the legal backing to gain equitable representation at the apex level of lawmaking and political participation.\n\n\u201cOur administration has continued to provide women with the opportunity to take up important roles in governance and they have proven to be excellent managers of human and material resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, therefore, lend my voice in calling on the National Assembly to reconsider its decision and take proactive and affirmative action in providing more opportunities for women to participate in politics, governance and all spheres of human endeavour,\u201d he stressed.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday stunned the gathering for his 85th birthday celebration when he said most of those running for top elective offices in the 2023 general elections are supposed to be serving various jail terms if the anti-graft agencies in the country had done their jobs well.\n\nChief Obasanjo made this comment while delivering his speech at the international symposium organised to mark his 85th birthday celebrations, held virtually and physically in Abeokuta the Ogun State capital.\n\nHe also urged Nigerians to prioritise the tasks of building a Nigerian nation rather than building personalities capable of further disintegrating the country.\n\nThe former military and civilian leader said his declaration was not just a carefree talk but premised on his examination and analysis of some politicians moving around the country holding consultations, as well as those whose associates are making consultations on their behalf towards occupying the number one political office of this country.\n\nHe said, \u201cI cast a cursory look at some of the people running around and those for whom people are running around. If EFCC and ICPC will have done their jobs properly, and supported adequately by the judiciary, most of them would be in jail.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAny person who has no integrity in small things cannot have integrity in big things. Fixing Nigeria must begin on the principles of nation building, not necessarily on emotion, sentiments, euphoria, ignorance, incompetence, ethnicity, nepotism, bigotry, sectionalism, regionalism, religion or class.\u201d\n\nObasanjo also denied reports that he had endorsed about three politicians from the Southern part of the country to take over from President Muhammed Buhari in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the quadrennial madness builds a head of steam and the runners and riders crisscross the nation in the quest for nomination as the party flag bearer to the highest office in the land, I read and hear about endorsement and statements in support of candidates that I, frankly, have not made, and forming next political parties that I can never get involved in.\n\n\u201cI was told that social media credited to me names of three people from the South that I am sponsoring for the Presidency in 2023. My friend, Professor Ango Abdullahi, who brought this to my knowledge, remarked that he did not believe that I made such a statement because it was out of my character.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI have neither named names, nor stated my position. In situations like the one we are in, I will not rush into naming names without necessary consultations and well-defined principles and criteria.\u201d\n\nObasanjo, however, maintained that policy makers and other citizens need to clearly distinguish between \u201cwhat Nigeria needs today and why Nigeria needs it. Only then can we answer the question of how that will inform us of the criteria and characteristics for determining who.\n\n\u201cI believe in principles before personalities; taking personalities before principles is putting the cart before the horse.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman further said all challenges of insecurity, corruption, and \u201cethnic jingoism\u201d which have militated against the country and prevented her from attaining the desired height of nationhood will naturally disappear \u201cif we get the issue of nation building right\u201d.\n\nSuggesting the way forward for the country, Obasanjo recommended that political office seekers, particularly all presidential aspirants, must be \u201cproperly x-rayed and profiled from birth\u201d so as to make Nigerians be better informed about who is going to lead the country.\n\nHe further recommended that Nigerians, through the appropriate agencies of government, must be educated to be able to make a choice that will be in the national interest and propel Nigeria forward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we have adequately taken care of nation-building measures, especially management of our unity, and taken care of every anomalous situation and performance or lack of it that have put us in political, security, economic and solid quagmire situations that we find ourselves in, then we must zero on personalities.\n\n\u201cEach contender must be properly x-rayed and profiled from birth and Nigerians must be educated to be able to make a choice that will be in the national interest and propel Nigeria forward. Such a person will have to lead what remains of the nation to courageously continue on the path of nation-building as a national team leader, no matter on what platform he or she assumes leadership\u201d.\n\nHe, however, said the task of nation building was a collective one that needs the people to prioritise objectivity over sentiment in order to choose the right candidate.\n\n\u201cNo one can do it alone. We must, however, stop sacrificing character, track records and performance on the altar of ethnic, regional or religious jingoism. As the watchman counts on daybreak, so too do I count on Nigerians and Nigeria to bring forth that person.\n\n\u201cI do not, cannot and will not at this point suggest the how and to what. I can only count on the patriotic commitment and desires of well-meaning Nigerians to start the process of forging a path out of darkness into the light of salvation and a new glorious dawn.\n\n\u201cIt is time to reach into the ability of Nigeria to always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat as we start this collective search on how we can climb out of this hole in which we find our country, Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the dignitaries that participated in the event physically and virtually included the director-general, World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngizi Okonko-Iweala; the President of the Republic of Benin, Nic\u00e9phore Soglo; Professor Goski Alabi (Ghana); Ambassador Barry Desker (Singapore); Professor Juma Shabani (Burundi); Dr. Mary Khimulu (Kenya); Dr. Moussa Kondo (Mali); Professor Sarah Agbor (Cameroon); Professor Chukwuma Soludo (in-coming Governor of Anambra State,) and Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (Muhammad Sanusi II, the 14th Emir of Kano and Khalifa of Tijjaniyya in Nigeria) to mention few.\n\nNumber Of Aspirants Will Shrink If Anti-graft Agencies Are Allowed To Work \u2013 Ohuabunwa\n\nA presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, has said the rank of aspirants will be few if the anti-graft agencies are allowed to do their job.\n\nOhuabunwa stated this while reacting to former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s comment that some persons aspiring to be Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023 should be in jail.\n\nHe said the former president as a two-time Head of State of Nigeria has a lot of information which many ordinary Nigerians may not be privy to, adding that he can be trusted when he says such things.\n\nHe however told LEADERSHIP yesterday that the problem was not with the anti-graft agencies but with the country\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe presidential aspirant noted that the endemic corruption in Nigeria has messed up the entire Nigerian moral fabric.\n\n\u201cA nation where an aspirant for the office of the Senate President is persuaded to step down and in return his case with EFCC is stepped down cannot be truly serious in fighting corruption, or where a party chairman gleefully announces on national TV that if you are found to be a thief in one party and then you cross over to his party, your crime would be immediately forgiven, and that truly happens without a rebuke from anyone shows how tolerant to corrupt the government is.\n\n\u201cPolitical leadership in Nigeria is about corruption. Indeed, if EFCC, ICPC and other anti-crime agencies in Nigeria are truly allowed to do their job, the rank of presidential and gubernatorial candidates will be very few.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, the trouble is not with the EFCC per se but the leadership that will not allow EFCC the free hand to do its job.\n\n\u201cThe endemic corruption in Nigeria which seems to proceed from the leaders to the led has messed up the entire Nigerian moral fabric,\u201d he noted.\n\nRoll Call Of Aspirants Seeking OBJ, IBB \u2018Anointing\u2019\n\nThough both have retired from active politics, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former military President Ibrahim Babangida have continued to be reference points for those aspiring for political relevance in Nigeria.\n\nGeneral Babangida announced his retirement from active politics over a decade ago but his hilltop residence in Minna has remained a Mecca of sorts for those aspiring for political offices.\n\nObviously, most politicians still believe in the efficacy of his support, advice, counselling, maverick approach and engagement capacity to help impact positively on their political fortunes.\n\nDuring his last birthday it was a show of who is who to the house; journalists were disallowed from entering.\n\nTop politicians who visited then were Sen. Bukola Saraki, Peter Obi, Sen. Philip Aduda, Sen. Ben Obi, Sen. Sani Musa, Akwa Ibom State Governor Emmanuel Udom, then PDP national chairman Uche Secondus and some of his National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nThe next day on August 18, 2021, Governor of Ekiti State and chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, accompanied by his Kebbi state counterpart, Atiku Bagudu, were also in the house for their own solidarity\n\nFayemi then said the commitments and patriotism displayed by Babangida had remained a reference point to younger generations.\n\nSources hinted that the 80th birthday of IBB was a guise as the event afforded the personalities the opportunity to go into close session with him to discuss the \u201ctrending issues in the country ahead of 2023\u201d.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday observed that in recent months many politicians have visited IBB secretly and openly; even those who are yet to declare publicly but are likely to be aspirants had various support groups visiting on their behalf.\n\nThe first of such support groups that visited were those canvassing for the presidential bid of Vice President Yemi Osibanjo. It was reported that Babangida endorsed the presidential bid of Osinbajo.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, former governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu visited Babangida after which he said the former military president was supporting him with prayers in his presidential aspiration.\n\nSimilarly, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on February 1, 2022 sneaked into IBB\u2019s hilltop mansion and went into a closed-door session, again just like Tinubu\u2019s visit journalists were not allowed to cover the visit.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday, however, observed that Atiku has been a regular visitor to IBB\u2019s house and seems to have a closer political affinity with him than any other politician ahead of the 2019 general election.\n\nAnother regular visitor to the house is the former Senate President Bukola Saraki who is also gunning for the presidential ticket of PDP.\n\nAlso, on February 17, 2022 Babangida received a 40-year-old All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, at his Hilltop Residence in Minna, where he advocated that the younger generations take over power, considering the global realities that put them in a better position.\n\nBabangida said due to good education, energy and brains of the younger generation, they are in a better stead to run the affairs of the country, reiterating his position for a younger president in 2023.\n\nHe also received the new national chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorcha Ayu at his hilltop residence in Minna on February 8, 2022\n\nUnlike other visits, this time there was a prepared speech and it was seemingly open. He said the present generation must give its today for the sake of its tomorrow\n\nHe agreed that Nigeria needed a credible intra party democracy that guaranteed free choice.\n\n\u201cOne major problem in our country is that when people complain about leadership being the problem and the solution; we often forget that the periods of Congresses and Conventions are critical to political recruitment and influences the process of leadership succession.\n\nIt was however gathered that beyond the secret and open visits reported to boost the image of aspirants or candidates, he often supports, financially and morally, those he has interest in.\n\nIt was learnt that beyond that IBB has actually played major roles in the recruitment process of who occupies the presidency since 1999 to date.\n\nSources hinted that despite his retirement from politics, in 2015 and 2019 he played a major role in the emergence of certain candidates in major political parties.\n\nAnother source who preferred anonymity, however, said: \u201cNow he seems to have left everything in the hands of his son (Mohammed) to the extent that he determines who visits him and who should not visit, who should be assisted or not; he cannot be that generous with political support as it used to be\u201d\n\nInvariably, the source hinted that because everything about the politics of Nigeria revolves around money, the influence will reduce if the expected support by the political actors coming to him is no longer forthcoming.\n\nAnother source hinted that \u201cin a major contest like the presidential election, you cannot wish away the influence of IBB, and his colleague former Nigerian leaders; they influence decisions at the top and IBB is key.\u201d\n\nAlso, between January year 2021 when political permutations and alignment towards the 2023 general elections started, clusters of Nigerian politicians, especially those seeking elective positions have been coming to the Abeokuta home of former President Olusegun Obasanjo for consultations.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday\u2019s checks revealed that prominent politicians including the former Senate President Bukola Saraki; the PDP national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu; Chief Dele Momodu; Bauchi State Governor Bala Muhammed and the Convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Prof. Ango Abdullahi have visited the elder statesman.\n\nOthers include Oyo State governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde; his counterpart from Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwa; PDP Vice Presidential candidate in 2019 general election, Peter Obi; former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido; former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; former governors of Cross River State, Liyel Imoke and Donald Duke; Delta State governorship aspirant for year 2023, Chief Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nExcept for the Bauchi State governor, Muhammed, who disclosed that he was in Abeokuta to consult with Obasanjo over his presidential ambition, none of the other aforementioned politicians openly declared that they came to Obasanjo\u2019s house because of their political ambitions; some told the media that they visited the former president to tap from his wealth of experience.\n\nIn the case of Atiku, who was a guest at the birthday celebration of former House of Representatives member, Hon. Ladi Adebutu in Iperu Remo, he only told the media that he could not have been in Ogun State without paying homage to his former principal.\n\nThough Obasanjo restated his decision to stay off party politics, his wealth of experience as a former military and civilian president cannot be overlooked.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to emphasise that I am no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that will bring me back to partisan politics.\n\n\u201cI will always be interested in what is good for Nigeria and anybody who wants to have my advice, I will distinctively give it in the best interest of Nigeria and in the best interest of Africa.\n\n\u201cThis is why I have the type of responsibility that I now have in the horn of Africa, which is not an easy thing.\u201d",
          "summary": "If EFCC and ICPC will have done their jobs properly, and supported adequately by the judiciary, most of them would be in jail.\n\u201cI was told that social media credited to me names of three people from the South that I am sponsoring for the Presidency in 2023.\nOhuabunwa stated this while reacting to former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s comment that some persons aspiring to be Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023 should be in jail.\nThe first of such support groups that visited were those canvassing for the presidential bid of Vice President Yemi Osibanjo.\nThough Obasanjo restated his decision to stay off party politics, his wealth of experience as a former military and civilian president cannot be overlooked.",

          "title": "How We Escaped Intense Bombings, Death In Ukraine-Russia War \u2013 Nigerians",
          "text": "Nigerians who escaped Russia\u2019s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine arrived in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, on Friday, narrating how they escaped the intense bombings and missiles fired by Russia\u2019s military forces.\n\nThe war, which has led to the death of hundreds of civilians and troops, leaving thousands injured and many more displaced, has seen millions of foreign nationals fleeing Ukraine for neighbouring countries.\n\nAs of Friday night, no fewer than 775 Nigerians had been flown back to the country. The first batch comprising 415 persons arrived from Romania in the morning while the second batch, comprising 180, arrived from Poland at about 6:30 pm. Another 180 arrived in the third batch. They were all received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. One more batch was being expected from Hungary and Poland as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSome of the returnees who fled Ukraine to Romania told Saturday PUNCH how they were able to escape the invasion. Despite appeals for diplomacy and the heavy sanctions imposed by other countries, the European Union and other allies, the Russian forces, under the strict orders of President Vladimir Putin, have continued to launch bombs and missiles into different parts of Ukraine, the second largest city in Europe.\n\nAnuoluwakintan Olawoye, a 300-level medical student at the University of Ternopil, said apart from the racial discrimination, she starved, trekked and stood for long hours. She noted that the reports of the invasion and bombs going off in different parts of the country were enough to plant fears in anybody, but that she was happy she was able to escape.\n\nShe said, \u201cI do not wish my enemy what I went through, even though mine was not as bad as others\u2019. There was a curfew, we starved because there was nothing to buy, no store opened and sirens blared every time! No taxis to move from one place to another. We had to trek for hours. The city was becoming vacant. We couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that the country was at war.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday morning, there was a bombing in Kyiv but thankfully I was in Ternopil so I escaped. Again on Friday, some parts of Lviv were bombed; Lviv is two hours journey away from Ternopil.\u201d\n\nOlawoye said she made for the Romanian border after trekking for hours but on getting there, she found that preference was given to Ukrainian citizens.\n\nShe added, \u201cWe got to the border around 4 pm and we were told to wait. We waited till 8 pm and they didn\u2019t allow us (blacks) to go inside. We attempted to make a move when they called on women and children and they turned us back. They only allowed their citizens to go. It was two hours after they left that they said they would come back to us.\n\n\u201cWe pleaded with the officers that the snow was much outside, I was shivering as a result but they did nothing. I crossed about 2 am and it was by luck. Some were not that lucky. The racism that I encountered at the Ukrainian border was not for the weak. They were pushing us aside just to allow their trucks to move. They shouted at us, pushed us and did all sorts.\u201d\n\nOlawoye, however, said she was treated very well in Romania, noting that she would be proceeding to meet her parents. She added that she would love to return to Ukraine to complete her studies once the war ends.\n\nAlso, Abraham Praise said she never believed she could experience such in her lifetime, especially with the bombs and missiles that had killed both troops and civilians in different parts of the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cI trekked for three hours non-stop. I had friends who trekked for more hours. You just had to forget you have legs while you keep going. The thought of you keeping yourself alive would keep you going. Some people fainted along the road. The stronger ones among us had to give them support. I never thought I would have to experience something like this.\u201d\n\nAbraham called on the government to assist evacuees with therapy to get over the experience, saying people who survived war, no matter how distant, needed some counselling.\n\nShe said, \u201cEveryone who has gone through this experience needs therapy. Although we are a strong people, to have made it out alive and be able to see your friends and families is exciting. For some of us, the future is still uncertain because of the disruption in our academics. I am in my third year while some others are in their final year and are meant to graduate in June.\u201d\n\nPraise added, \u201cAlthough I am happy I would be seeing my family, this is not just the way I wanted it. But there is still life and there\u2019s hope. If this is where we would have to start from to move ahead, we are ready.\u201d\n\nRabia Zalka who was in Ukraine with her sister said she didn\u2019t know if she would survive, but that to have made it back to Nigeria alive despite the invasion, rising tension, the bombing of cities and even the capture of the Nuclear plant by the Russians, meant a lot to them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was really serious until my sister and I walked a long distance to the Romanian border. I trekked for hours. It was not easy. We were keeping an eye on each other and helping each other,\u201d said Zalka.\n\nAnother returnee, Peter Ajuwon, said the Ukraine war should serve as a lesson to Nigerians on the importance of peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cWar is not a favourable situation. Every aspect of life gets affected. I encourage people to embrace peace in Nigeria. Our experiences crossing the border to Romania were not pleasant. Getting to Romania was hell, but we had a pleasant experience in Romania. We got a lot of support from the Romanian government and the Nigerian Ambassador there. Some Romanian NGOs showed us love too; they didn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d\n\nSome of the parents and relatives who came to receive them were visibly elated seeing their children alive. Some of them had kept vigil at the airport, awaiting the return of their children.\n\nOther parents whose children had yet to arrive were seen lurking around and anxiously waiting for their children\u2019s return.\n\nMrs Zalka whose two daughters were among the first batch said she was happy to have her daughters back in the country. She told our correspondent she could not eat, she cried almost every day and prayed for the safe return of her daughters who were schooling in Ukraine.\n\nZalka said, \u201cWe thank God they are back with us. I was not eating, I cried almost every day and prayed fervently while they were away. I don\u2019t have anything to say but to thank God.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the next plans for her daughters, she told our correspondent that she would enrol them in another school in Nigeria.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have secured admission for them in the country, so by next month they should be back in school. There are a lot of universities looking for students, particularly those from Ukraine.\u201d",

I will never do that,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Emeka Nnamdi, who is still stuck in Sumy, Ukraine, he will prefer to come back home, but only for a short while.\n\n\u201cI am currently doing my Masters here,\u201d Nnamdi said. \u201cI finished my six years of Medical School here. And I am doing a specialty course, which will take me three years. But if I\u2019m doing a specialty course in Nigeria, it will take me more than five years, if not seven years. So why should I come home?\u201d\n\nEvacuation flights\n\nMore than 700 Nigerians were evacuated from Poland, Hungary and Romania on Friday.\n\nJets from Nigerian airlines, Max Air and Air Peace, were deployed for the evacuation operation.\n\nThe Federal Government on Wednesday said it has approved $8.5m for the evacuation of citizens fleeing Ukraine.\n\nAlthough some Nigerians are still stuck in Ukraine, many have made it to neigbouring countries where the evacuation flights are taking off from.\n\nAccording to Foreign Ministry sources, about 5,000 Nigerians are said to be eligible for evacuation.\n\nOn arrival, the returnees were given a $100 stipend to allow them travel within Nigeria to meet up with loved ones.\n\nAccording to a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda, talks are ongoing with Polish, Greek, Romanian and Hungarian authorities to allow Nigerian students in their final years of medical school complete their courses in universities in these countries.\n\nMr Aduda said the Nigerian government was seeing \u201cvery positive signs\u201d in these discussions.\n\n\u2018More risky\u2019\n\nIbrahim, who said he was not aware of the evacuation flights organised by the Nigerian government, maintained that his focus was on staying in Europe.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, I can\u2019t even dress like this in my home country,\u201d he said on the Zoom call, referring to his dreadlocks. \u201cEverybody knows this.\n\n\u201cAs war has broken out, we are supposed to run to our country for safety. But I\u2019ll rather stay here.\n\n\u201cWe are all here risking our life, but going back to our country is more risky.\u201d",

          "text": "In the age of Covid, Jordanian mechanical engineer Saliba Taimeh pondered how to deal with one contaminated everyday surface: the handrails of escalators in shopping malls and transport hubs.\n\nHe came up with a device to sterilise them with UV rays \u2014 and this is where TechWorks stepped in.\n\nA wealth of ideas would not have seen the light of day without TechWorks, a Jordanian platform aimed at bringing together youth, ideas and resources to jump-start innovations.\n\nSet up in 2018, TechWorks says its mission is \u201cto plug into entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems\u201d and turn ideas into reality.\n\nIt is equipped with state-of-the-art technology such as 3D printers and affiliated with a foundation set up by Crown Prince Hussein.\n\nLast year, it attracted about 100 inventors and start-up companies, enabling them to produce prototypes quickly and at low cost.\n\nTaimeh, 39, said TechWorks \u201cprovided me with every support, back-up, advice and guidance\u201d to help perfect the sterilising device, after 23 attempts over almost two years.\n\nHis invention sterilises the handrails of escalators \u201cfrom all kinds of viruses, such as coronavirus and bacteria,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter contacting several international companies, a German firm specialising in health and safety in public places signed up to manufacture the \u201cBrigid Box\u201d.\n\nWeighing in at 7.2 kilograms (almost 16 pounds), it can be installed in less than 15 minutes.\n\n\u2013 Success stories \u2013\n\nTaimeh\u2019s success story is only one of many.\n\nHigh school student Zain Abu Rumman, 18, has developed a tracking device for elderly patients and people with special needs, worn like a watch or around the neck.\n\nThe \u201cSPS Watch\u201d has a battery that lasts eight days and is resistant to water, heat and breakage.\n\n\u201cThe device can send alerts to the mobile phone of a family member through a special application in case the person wearing it falls or is hurt, or if he strays from a certain place,\u201d Abu Rumman said.\n\nIt took him two-and-a-half years to perfect and he has struck a production accord with a Chinese company.\n\nOmar Khader, 26, works for \u201cJazri Studio\u201d, an industrial design company which has devised a \u201csmart\u201d plug to protect children from electric shocks.\n\n\u201cTechWorks has advanced equipment, engineers and technicians that help us convert our ideas into successful products,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 FabLab \u2018open to all\u2019 \u2013\n\nOther designers, like 32-year-old civil engineer Malik Nour, still have a long and expensive way to go to refine their products.\n\nNour\u2019s brainchild is the \u201cPikler Triangle\u201d, designed as a safe and environmentally friendly children\u2019s toy.\n\nHe hopes to attract Swedish furniture giant IKEA to take on his products, which he is already selling over social media to customers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, under the label of \u201cFares World\u201d, named after his child.\n\nIsmail Hakki, executive director of TechWorks, said its aim is to provide \u201ca creative environment and all the necessary resources to support and enable young people to transform their projects from a mere idea into a real product\u201d.\n\nThe doors of the project\u2019s \u201cFabrication Lab\u201d, or FabLab, are \u201copen to all; we support students, entrepreneurs, and startups\u201d, he said.\n\nFabLab also provides services to doctors and hospitals in the fields of facial restoration, digital dentistry, face masks and sterilisation.\n\nAt the request of a doctor, it transformed the chest x-ray of a patient with a malignant tumour close to the heart into a three-dimensional model of the patient\u2019s chest making it easier to operate.\n\nFabLab touts many successes, including a \u201csmart home\u201d which allows a mobile phone user to control electrical appliances inside the house from afar by turning on heating or cooling systems, and a piano keyboard to help a blind musician play.\n\nIt plans to open two more branches in Jordan to provide technology training and help for school and university students.",

          "text": "U.S. payments firms Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc on Saturday said they were suspending operations in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, and that they would work with clients and partners to cease all transactions there.\n\nWithin days, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside of the country and any Visa cards issued outside of Russia will no longer work within the country, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe are compelled to act following Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,\u201d Al Kelly, chief executive officer of Visa, said in a statement.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, in a call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s decisions to suspend their operations in Russia, the White House said.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden noted his administration is surging security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding,\u201d a White House readout of the call added.\n\nThe move by the payments firms could mean more disruption for Russians who are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods.\n\nUnprecedented Western sanctions imposed on Russia have frozen much of the country\u2019s central bank\u2019s $640 billion in assets; barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT; and sent the rouble into free-fall, erasing a third of its value this week.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine\u2019s central bank chief Kyrylo Shevchenko told Nikkei Asia the central bank and Zelenskiy urged Visa and MasterCard to halt transactions of their credit and debit cards issued by Russian banks to increase pressure on the Russian regime, the paper.\n\nA growing number of financial and technology companies have suspended Russian operations. PayPal Holdings Inc, announced its decision earlier on Saturday.\n\nALTERNATIVE SYSTEM\n\nSberbank Rossii PAO, Russia\u2019s largest lender, said the moves by Visa and Mastercard would not affect users of the cards it issues in Russia, Tass news reported.\n\nSberbank said its customers would be able to withdraw cash, make transfers, pay both in offline stores and Russian internet stores because transactions in Russia pass through the domestic National Payment Card System which does not depend on foreign payment systems, according to Tass.\n\nRussia has been taking steps to increase the independence of its financial system for years, particularly after ties with the West deteriorated over the country\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nThe country set up its own banking messaging system, known as SPFS, as an alternative to SWIFT and its own card payment system MIR began operating in 2015. They were part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to develop homegrown financial tools to mirror Western ones, to protect the country in case sanctions are broadened. read more\n\nMastercard and Visa had significant business in Russia. In 2021, about 4% of Mastercard\u2019s net revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Meanwhile, business conducted within, into and out of Ukraine accounted for 2% of its net revenues, according to a filing on Tuesday.\n\nVisa also reported that total net revenue from Russia in 2021 was about 4% of its total.\n\nMastercard, which has operated in Russia for 25 years, said its cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by Mastercard networks, and that any the company\u2019s card issued outside of the Russia will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs.\n\nMastercard said it decided to suspend its network services in Russia following its recent action to block multiple Russian financial institutions from the company\u2019s payment network, as required by regulators globally.\n\nVisa also said this week it blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from its network in compliance with government sanctions imposed over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",

          "text": "Russian President, Mr. Vladimir Putin, jn Saturday stated that the sanctions imposed on his country by western countries over the invasion of Ukraine were like a declaration of war.\n\nHis comment came a few hours after the Ministry of Defence said that it had resumed \u201coffensive actions\u201d in Ukraine after announcing a ceasefire earlier in the day to allow residents of two besieged cities to evacuate.\n\nNo fewer than 100,000 Nigerians and other Africans have signed a petition on the discrimination against blacks who are attempting to flee Ukraine over the invasion of the Eastern European country by Russia.\n\nSpeaking to flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow, Putin insisted he only wanted to \u201cdemilitarise\u201d and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions are methods of fighting against Russia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions that you can see are equivalent to declaring a war \u2013 but thankfully it has not come to an actual war but we understand what these threats are about.\u201d\n\nPutin also warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be seen as \u201cparticipation in the armed conflict\u201d.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine had asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) for a no-flight-zone over Ukraine in order to protect the country from Russian missiles but the appeal was rejected.\n\nNATO had said taking such an action could result in a \u201cfull-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries\u201d.\n\nSince the start of the invasion of Ukraine, a series of sanctions have been imposed on Russia by the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nSome of the sanctions include blocking certain Russian banks\u2019 access to the SWIFT payment system and freezing the foreign assets of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nThree of the country\u2019s wealthy individuals were sanctioned by the UK while the Council of Europe also suspended Russia from the continent\u2019s human rights organisation.\n\nIn addition, FIFA and UEFA also suspended Russian clubs and national teams from all competitions.\n\nSamsung, Paypal, Zara, Apple, and Mercedes-Benz have all announced the suspension of their operations in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) revealed that it counted about 1,368,864 refugees on its dedicated website at noon Saturday, almost 160,000 more than the previous count on Friday.\n\nRussian defence ministry also announced the resumption of offensive after a ceasefire on Saturday.\n\n\u201cDue to the unwillingness of the Ukrainian side to influence nationalists or extend the regime of silence, offensive actions have been resumed at 18:00 Moscow time (1500 GMT),\u201d Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov said in a video briefing.\n\nRussia had earlier announced a ceasefire and said it opened humanitarian corridors for the exit of civilians from the strategic port town of Mariupol and neighbouring Volnovakha.\n\nKonashenkov said that \u201cnot a single civilian\u201d was able to exit via the humanitarian corridors.\n\n\u201cThe population of these cities is held by nationalist formations as a human shield,\u201d Konashenkov added.\n\nHe said \u201cnationalist battalions\u201d used the ceasefire to \u201cregroup and reinforce their positions\u201d.\n\nOfficials in Mariupol, surrounded by Russian forces, said on Saturday that they were delaying an evacuation of the civilian population, accusing Moscow\u2019s troops of breaking a ceasefire.\n\nAuthorities and the UN expect the flow of refugees to intensify as the Russian army continues to advance into Ukraine, with fierce fighting still taking place around the capital Kyiv.\n\n\u201c1.3 million people have now fled Ukraine to seek safety. Unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee,\u201d the UNHCR said in a tweet on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the UN, four million people may seek to leave the country to escape the war.\n\nBefore the conflict, Ukraine had more than 37 million people in areas controlled by Kyiv \u2014 which does not include Russian-annexed Crimea or separatist-controlled areas.\n\nPoland, which has championed the cause of Ukrainian refugees and where US Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken arrived on Saturday for talks with the country\u2019s top officials, is hosting by far the largest number of refugees arriving since the start of the Russian invasion.\n\nNo fewer than 100,000 Nigerians and other Africans have signed a petition on the discriminatio+n against blacks who are attempting to flee Ukraine over the invasion of the Eastern European country by Russia.\n\nThe online petition, which was initiated by a civil society organisation, Concerned Nigerians, was titled \u2018Stop discriminating, provide safe passages for Africans and People of Colour out of Ukraine.\u2019\n\nThe petition, published by a global advocacy body, Change.Org, is to the Council of the European Union, European Commission, African Union, and the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe UNHCR had not updated the number of refugees in Moldova on Saturday, which stood at 103,254 on Friday, or 7.5 percent of the total.\n\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, was in Moldova on Friday, in the eastern town of Palanca where refugees are arriving.\n\n\u201cToday at Palanca I saw thousands and thousands of people streaming across Ukraine\u2019s border crossing with Moldova. Thousands of stories of separation, anguish, and loss. A difficult day, but much respect for the many dedicated Moldovan officials and people helping the refugees,\u201d Grandi said in a tweet on Friday evening.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, some of the refugees are continuing on to Romania or Hungary, often to reunite with family.\n\nSome 101,529 people have fled Ukraine and taken refuge in Slovakia, 7.4 percent of the total, according to the UNHCR.\n\nIn Romania, the UNHCR counts 63,192 refugees, about 4.6 percent of the total.\n\nTwo camps have been set up, one in Sighetu Marmatiei and the other in Siret.\n\nUNHCR also said that 133,876 people, around one in 10, had continued on to other European countries after crossing the Ukrainian border.\n\nThe number of people taking refuge in Russia remained unchanged at around 53,000, or 3.9 per cent of the total.\n\nNigeria has so far evacuated 807 of its citizens from war-raged Ukraine as at Saturday.",
