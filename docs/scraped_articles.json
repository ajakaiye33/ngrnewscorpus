          "title": "N322m fraud: EFCC to appeal Nwaoboshi\u2019s victory as Buhari welcomes him to APC",
          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says it will challenge the victory of Delta North Senator, Peter Nwaoboshi, who was recently discharged and acquitted of alleged fraud to the tune of N322m on June 18, 2020.\n\nThe spokesman for the EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, said this during an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe will be taking Senator Nwaoboshi\u2019s case before the Court of Appeal,\u201d Uwujaren said during a brief telephone interview with one of our correspondents.\n\nThis comes just as the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), personally welcomed Nwaoboshi to the ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\nBesides, the Niger Delta Development Commission had last year accused Nwaoboshi of using 11 companies as fronts to secure a N3.6bn contract from the NDDC and failing to execute the contract, an allegation which the senator has denied.\n\nIn 2018, Nwaoboshi was arraigned by the EFCC before a Federal High Court in Lagos for N322m fraud involving two of his companies.\n\nNwaoboshi and the two companies \u2013 Golden Touch Construction Project Limited and Suiming Electrical Ltd \u2013 were arraigned for acquiring a property, Guinea House, on Marine Road, Apapa, Lagos for N805m. The EFCC alleged that N322m out of the N805m was part of the proceeds of fraud.\n\nHowever, Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke said the EFCC relied on hearsay as evidence.\n\nOne week after his acquittal, the lawmaker, who is a former state chairman of the PDP, was welcomed by the President, according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja welcomed Senator Peter Nwaoboshi to the APC after he left the Peoples Democratic Party, saying \u2018you are welcome to the progressives\u2019 family.\u2019\n\n\u201cSenator Nwaoboshi, representing Delta North District, Delta State, was presented to President Buhari and the National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee at the State House by Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\n\u201cThe Deputy Senate President said Senator Nwaoboshi\u2019s decision to join the APC clearly shows that the effort of the CECPC was yielding fruit. The senator was warmly welcomed by party members.\u201d\n\nWhy Nwaoboshi defected to APC \u2013Investigation\n\nMeanwhile, an investigation by Saturday PUNCH revealed that Nwaoboshi dumped the PDP for the APC to perfect his ambition of running for the deputy governor of Delta State in 2023.\n\nNwaoboshi announced his defection when he met with President Buhari at Aso Villa on Friday.\n\nThe lawmaker was said to have been accompanied on the visit by Omo-Agege, who hails from Delta Central and is said to be eyeing the governorship seat.\n\nNwaoboshi\u2019s defection is coming two days after the state PDP suspended him from the party for one month over anti-party activities.\n\nAccording to the PDP, the action became necessary against the backdrop of the recent \u201cromance with an opposition party, APC, verbal recklessness and unprovoked utterances of Nwaoboshi which the state PDP Working Committee views strongly as totally unacceptable and disturbing.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker was also said to have been embroiled in verbal attacks against Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, whom he succeeded at the Senate in 2015.\n\nNwaoboshi had recently rated Okowa\u2019s government as poorly performing compared to his predecessors, James Ibori and Emmanuel Uduaghan.\n\nMeanwhile, Okowa on Thursday replied to the lawmaker, who he described as \u201ca stranger\u201d. The governor said Nwaoboshi should not be pitching him with his predecessors.\n\nReacting to his defection, the PDP in Delta State dismissed the claims that Nwaoboshi defected as he had already been suspended.\n\nThe party, in a statement signed by its state Publicity Secretary, Dr Ifeanyi Osuoza, said, \u201cWe wish to state for the avoidance of doubt that Senator Peter Nwaoboshi had already been duly suspended by the state Working Committee of our party following his recent romance with an opposition party, his verbal recklessness, and unprovoked utterances against the person of His Excellency, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, the Governor of Delta State.\n\n\u201cThose unbecoming attitude of the senator exposed him as indecorous and lacking discipline which the PDP cherishes so much. The party had to quickly rise to the occasion by treating him like a mad cow in the china shop and manage his exit through suspension so as to save the soul of the PDP in the State.\n\n\u201cHis inevitable exit, therefore, has left a wave of joy in the party as faithful and loyal party members see the move as good riddance to bad rubbish.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Auditor-General queries multibillion-naira irregularities in NPA accounts",
          "text": "The Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation has issued seven queries on the audited accounts of the Nigerian Ports Authority in 2017.\n\nThe queries include standalone financial statements, non-current assets (depreciation, addition to fixed assets, property, plant and equipment, and interest in joint ventures), current assets (cash and cash equivalent, trapped fund in Enterprise Bank, inventories, trade receivables, etc.), liabilities, statement of profit and loss, and other comprehensive income, expenditures and administrative expenses.\n\nThe Auditor General, Adolphus Aghughu, in an audit report sent to the National Assembly, dated May 24, 2021, a copy of which journalists obtained on Friday, demanded explanation from the management of the NPA on its audited accounts, which he said was submitted to his office on February 22, 2019 for comment, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.\n\nThe House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts invited the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the management of NPA to appear before it on July 8, 2021 over the queries.\n\nSpeaking on the N65.763bn spent on fixed assets, Aghughu said the NPA management should furnish the analysis of the assets acquired during the year, showing suppliers, evidence of ownership, gross amounts, outstanding amounts (if any), taxes deducted and remitted to the relevant tax authority and the current status of the assets.\n\nAlso on property, plant and equipment, on which N390.581bn was spent, the Auditor General said, \u201cThe carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment and properties on lease were qualified in the auditor\u2019s independent report, because they were unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to confirm the completeness, existence and valuation of the carrying amounts.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the management is required to provide the schedules of movable assets purchased by the concessionaires per the various lease agreement and furnish the list of assets in use and projects in progress acquired or being executed by the concessionaires for the authority under the ports development programmes of the lease agreements for audit scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe NPA is also expected to provide \u201csufficient records, backed up with a detailed fixed asset register to support the existence, completeness and carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, as well as properties on lease,\u201d while Aghughu further asked the management to \u201cprovide an updated non-current assets register showing the dates of purchase, location of assets and amount depreciated to date.\u201d\n\nThe management is also to provide a list of property, plant and equipment transferred to Continental Shipyards Limited at inception as part of the NPA\u2019s capital contribution and furnish the list of various assets, including buildings disposed by the authority in the last three years.\n\nAghughu further demanded a schedule of bank balances showing the names and locations of the banks at which cash and cash equivalent from current assets of the authority are maintained, the individual account balances and the respective comparative figures.\n\nThe office further asked for a \u201cdetailed list of the subsidiaries and the bank balances resulting in the observed total difference of N168,458,000 in the bank balances within and outside Nigeria between the group and the authority, which represent the balances of the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cCogent reasons why the accounts were garnishee by the law court and detailed efforts towards setting aside the order as shown in the table below being cash and cash equivalent under garnishee order by the law court.\u201d\n\nThe office also reported that funds amounting to about $3.231m may have been trapped in Enterprise Bank as the report from the NPA management showed that \u201cthere was no movement in Enterprise Bank account with Number 6003605768 during the year.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe balance has not changed from $3,231,677.45 for more than two financial years,\u201d asking the management to provide the current status of this bank balance.\n\nThe Auditor General also queried the status of the Staff Home Ownership Scheme as well as the N1.5bn deposited as initial takeoff fund with Aso Savings and Loans Plc, which Aghughu said served as an agent for the creation of mortgages and the subsequent collections of repayments on the same mortgages, adding that the NPA later severed relationship with the bank, following the Federal Government directive on Treasury Single Account implementation in 2015.\n\nThe office said an audit examination showed that the NPA made an advance payment of about N4.479bn to contractors and demanded that the name of the individual contractor, nature of the contract, age analysis of each of the contracts and reasons for not sanctioning in line with the Financial Regulation 3104(1).\n\nThe Auditor General also demanded explanation from the NPA on the current status of about N2.334bn received from shipping companies in 2013 as tracking fees, which was deposited with First City Monument Bank and was supposed to have been transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in 2017.\n\nSpeaking on circularisation of the management letter with terminal operators, the office said, \u201cAccording to the Management Report, Page 37, Paragraph 5.3.1, seven terminal operators\u2019 circularised two responses were received, while others had yet to reply.\u201d\n\nAghughu noted that while one of the terminal operators quoted an indebtedness of $513,150.51, the NPA records were reading $4,485,981.52, showing a difference of $3,972,831.01. He added that while the second operator, ABTL, quoted $619,372.99, the NPA records showed $2,383,675.24 variance, with a difference of $1,764,302.25.\n\nThe NPA also queried \u201ctrade and other payable\u201d on which N116,674,099,000 was spent, demanding the name of the creditors, services rendered, comparative figures as well as a breakdown of the Value Added Tax and Withholding Tax, stating the reasons the remittances amounting to about N35,317,209,000 were not made to the relevant tax authority.\n\nApart from a revenue of N239.480bn reported, for which the office is demanding a breakdown into their various components for audit scrutiny, Aghughu also queried under-remittance of operating surplus by the authority in 2017.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was observed on Page 15 of the Financial Statements that the operating surplus for the year 2017 was N76,782,268,000 and N42,414,819,000 was appropriated for the year. However, during vetting, it was discovered that the sum of N61,425,814,400 should have been the appropriate operating surplus to be transferred to Consolidated Revenue Fund using 80 per cent as a basis, hence an under remittance amounting to \u20a619,010,995,000 be remitted without further delay.\u201d\n\nThe Auditor General also demanded explanation from the NPA on how the sum of N116.680m was expended, budgetary provision and evidence of the work done.\n\nAghughu also queried what he called excessive increase in administrative expenses, with insurance and licenses increasing from N1.182bn in 2016 to N3.809bn in 2017, an increase by about 222.1 per cent, while professional charges rose from N638.482m in 2016 to N7.208bn in 2017, representing 1,029 per cent.\n\nSimilarly, cost for repairs and maintenance increased from N209.044m in 2016 to N1.039bn in 2017, an increase of 397.3 per cent, while Oslo rebates stood at N6.409bn in 2017.\n\nThe Auditor General is also asking the NPA to provide the list of items insured, insurance policies, budgetary provisions and reasons for the escalation of the cost in 2017 by 222.1 per cent for audit scrutiny, provide the nature of the professional services, names and addresses of the professional firms, report of professional services rendered, which led to professional charges increased to N7,208,021,000 in 2017 from N638,482,000 in 2016.\n\nAghughu also wants the management to explain with breakdown, the increase in repairs and maintenance in 2017 to N1,039,505,000, from N209,044,000 in 2016, giving a difference of N830,461,000 (percentage increase of 397.3) and also provide the list of vessels that applied and granted Oslo rebates of N6,409,886,000 with relevant supporting documents.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026charges troops to be focused, professional in tackling insecurity\n\nBy Evelyn Usman\n\nChief of the Army Staff, COAS Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaha, has assured troops in different theatres of operations across the country of his resolve to sustain prompt payment of their allowances, as a boost for optimal discharge of their constitutional responsibility.\n\nThis is just as he has charged them to be focused, disciplined and professional as they tackle insecurity.\n\nThe COAS gave the assurance while declaring open the Nigerian Army Finance Corps Warrant Officer/Senior Non-Commissioned training week for Warrant officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers training week 2021, at Nebo hall, Abati barracks, Ojuelegba Laos, yesterday.\n\nThe training week according to the COAS who was represented by the General Officer Commanding, GOC 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Lawrence Fejokwu, was designed to improve the capability and competency of Warrant officers and Senior non commissioned officers as well as enable them operate optimally as a vital link between officers and soldiers.\n\nHe stated that for the Nigerian Army to remain competitive in the 21st century, it must continue to develop requisite skills and competences that would make it ever ready to achieve its constitutional mandate.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn view of the contemporary security challenges in Nigeria, the Nigerian Army must remain focused, disciplined and professional in dealing with these challenges, especially in a joint environment. Thus, the development and deployment of physical capability will contribute significantly to the defense and security of our nation.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army must of necessity be creative and improve its problem solving skill to be able to defeat all forms of adversaries, particularly non-state actors. To achieve this, the prudent utilization of finance and indeed all resources can never be over emphasized , especially in the state of building national resources\u201d\n\nIn order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, the COAS said the theme of the training week was aptly crafted as \u2018Repositioning Nigerian Army Finance Corp: Warrant Officers, Senior Non-Commissioned Officers for professional and innovative financial service delivery to the Nigerian Army\u2019.\n\nHe advised the Corps to provide professional and innovative financial services in line with financial and other extant regulations , expressing delight that the training week was taking place at a time where there was a greater demand for openness, prudence, accountability in the use of public funds.\n\nThe COAS explained that \u201cthe prudent and efficient use of the public fund also becomes compelling given the anti corruption drive of the Federal Government of Nigeria as well as dwindling national revenue due to the advert effect of global Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWe need to be more open in managing the scarce resources that are allocated to the Nigerian Army and we need to be more open to justifying whatever has been appropriated to us.\n\n\u201cI would like to acknowledge the Nigerian Army Finance Corps\u2019 efforts towards an effective delivery of quality professional financial advisory tasks and taking special note of the positive reform towards the prompt payment of troops operation allowances across the spectrum of operation and other related allowances in the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cPayment of men that are in various theaters of operation has always been going on very well. It is going to be sustained . As long as we receive whatever that is required from the federal government of Nigeria, we on our part, will do the needful\u201d, the COAS stated.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Chief of Account and Budgeting, Nigerian Army, Major General Adekunle Adesope, explained that the training week was designed to strengthen and improve the performance of Warrant officers and senior non commissioned officers in executing their core functions as the vital link between officers, soldiers and junior leadership in the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe fundamental objective of this particular training according to him, aligned a with the imperative of the Finance Corps mantra \u201cwhich is to professionally and relatively discharge financial services in support of all Nigerian Army constitutional duties.\n\n\u201cThis has become expedient considering the dynamics of the contemporary environment that places a premium on requisite expertise in meaningful decision making and complex strategic thinking in prioritizing need due to acutely scarce resources.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, the \\warrant officers and senior non commissioned officers training is coming against the backdrop of a mirage of security challenges besetting our nation.\n\nRelevant topics have been carefully selected for deliberation to achieve the aim of the theme for this year\u2019s training week. It is believed that the training will provide the prerequisite for improving skills and professional capability of participants in the very changing financial sector which is highly regulated and guided by government policy and internationally accepted best practices.\n\n\u201cYour roles are quite distinct and very important, being the link between the soldiers and junior leadership in the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army towards the attainment of our premium objective for this year\u201d, Maj.GenAdesope stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026Consumption rises to 103m/day\n\n-FG paying N94 per litre as petrol subsidy \u2013 NNPC\n\nBy Obas Esiedesa, Abuja\n\nStakeholders in the downstream sector of the petroleum have blamed distribution system and low pump price for the increasing rate of smuggling of premium motor spirit, petrol, out of Nigeria.\n\nThe stakeholders who include marketers, depot owners and transporters called for synergy to check the activities of smugglers.\n\nSpeaking at a stakeholders meeting to work out synergy to tackle incidents of smuggling of petroleum products criminals, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Alhaji Aminu Abdulkadiri urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, to release more products to its members.\n\nAbdulkadiri noted that with over 20,000 filling stations across the country, IPMAM members sell directly to the Nigerian people.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been in this industry for over 30 years and there are underlying issues that I want the GMD to take cognizance of and this will go a long way in chasing who does what.\n\n\u201cOne, we have almost 30,000 retail outlets in this country and both major marketers and DAPMAN have about 2000-3000, the rest belong to my members. But the truth there is who is responsible for storing and distributing this product? The bulk of this product is being distributed by DAPMAN.\n\n\u201cNNPC needs to work with IPMAN and DAPMAN ensure that marketers that have retail outlets that are viable for Nigerian consumers should be attached to each depot in this country. That way NNPC can track most of these products that are being either diverted or smuggled out.\n\n\u201cBut so long as the source of distribution is not monitored and product are sold indiscriminately, the problem will continue\u201d, he added.\n\nOn her part, Chairman, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria, DAPMAN, Mrs. Winifred Akpani said the group was concerned about the high volume of petrol consumption in Nigeria.\n\nAkpani said it was difficult to determine the actual amount of petrol consumed in the country pointing out however that the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, has critical role to play if smuggling was to end in the country.\n\n\u201cWe as depot operators do not own all these stations but we sell a lot to people who have the stations. And one thing we always insist is where is your DPR licence not only are you going to show us your DPR licence we are going to cross check with the list that updated periodically and send to each depot by the DPR and it only on that basis that we sell product to you,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted with the resources and technology available in the industry, tracking the movement of trucks should not be a big challenge.\n\nAlso speaking, the National President of the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners, NARTO, Alhaji Yusuf Lawal Othman called for closer monitoring truck outs at the depots.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe system needs to be reorganized. I don\u2019t see any reason why you have 200 filling stations in a local government that does not consume more than 45000 litres. I also don\u2019t see how the depot which normally do programme per day will programme quite a number of trucks to a local government which does not consume more 45000 litres per day. It means that we are sleeping\u201d.\n\nEarlier, The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, has disclosed the open price of premium motor spirit, petrol, has risen to N256 per litre.\n\nWith the present pump price of petrol pegged at N162 per litre, it means government is subsidizing the product by N94 per litre.\n\nKyari said petrol daily truck out has risen significantly to 103 million per litre.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we are to sell at the market today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation\u201d.\n\nHe noted that with the high volume of daily consumption, the country cannot sustain subsidy payment adding \u201cas long as we don\u2019t regulate volume, until we are able to exit this current level, which I know so much work is going on, then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256.\n\n\u201cThe difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly. As long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, stress of supply and stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC. We may not see foreign exchange cheque taking place for importation\u201d.\n\nKyari stressed at the meeting which had the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and other relevant downstream and upstream stakeholders in attendance, harped on the need to find urgent solution to petrol smuggling challenge in the country.\n\nHe explained: \u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June, there was a day we load out about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots. We know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depot but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us, when there is tight in supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem\u201d.\n\nThe NNPC boss said that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that smuggling must stop adding that it was the reason for inviting all stakeholders to chart the way forward.",

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin/Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nSets dates for ward, LG, state congresses\n\nWhat party must do to survive, by Buhari\n\nSenator Nwaoboshi defects to ruling party\n\nThe National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday got the nod for an indefinite extension of its tenure.\n\nThe tenure extension followed a meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and the Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni-led committee at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe panel will cease to function upon the conduct of the party\u2019s more crucial national convention for which no date has yet been fixed.\n\nBut the ward, local government and state congresses of the APC will kick off on Saturday, July 24, 2021 at the ward level, according to a time table released last night by the CECPC.\n\nThe local government congresses will follow three weeks later on August 14 and the state congresses on September 18.\n\nThere was no mention of a date for the national convention.\n\nSecretary of the committee, Dr.John Akpanduoehehe, said in a statement that the APC National Executive Committee (NEC), at its last meeting, conferred on the CECPC the power of the National Convention in line with powers provided in Article 13.3 of the Party\u2019s Constitution.\n\nHe said the President granted the approval after detailed consideration of the progress report, the schedule of outstanding activities with regards to congresses, the national convention and the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election.\n\nHe said the tenure of the caretaker committees at the ward, local government, state and national levels will end immediately elections are held and the executive councils inaugurated.\n\nHe said Buni presented to the President a report on the activities of the committee and informed him that during the period under review, the APC recorded an overall success rate of 95 per cent in elections contested by it.\n\nHe said the committee also succeeded in forging peace among aggrieved members by \u201cgiving all issues and every aggrieved member fair hearing and objectively placing party interests above individual interests.\u201d\n\nMala was quoted as saying: \u201cBuoyed by the CECPC transparent and objective approach to the problems that bedeviled the party and the renewed confidence and trust in the party, aggrieved individuals and groups who either left or sued the party in various courts, willingly accepted reconciliation and withdrew all litigations against the party.\n\n\u201cWith your excellent leadership roles for the party, we are witnessing high-powered defections including serving governors from the PDP to our great party. It is also interesting that the fortune of the party in the last year has greatly improved across the country, and especially in the South-East, which has been the stronghold of the opposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleased to state that the party is now more peaceful, more accommodating, and more united with greater prospects than when we came on board.\u201d\n\nOn the just concluded nationwide membership registration, revalidation and register update exercise, Buni said the committee was able to establish the numerical strength of the party as provided by the party constitution and help strengthen the party\u2019s planning processes for congresses, conventions and general elections.\n\nOver 40 million members, according to him, were either registered as new members or revalidated their membership with the party.\n\nThe CECPC National Chairman further informed the President that the Committee has set up a Registration Appeal Committee to hear matters arising from the exercise to ensure that no member is left out.\n\nHe also informed the President of newly set up committees to reposition the party, including Sensitization and Mobilisation Committee on Youth, Women and People Living with Disabilities, which contributed tremendously to the success recorded in the nationwide membership registration, revalidation and update exercise.\n\n\u201cA Contact and Strategy Committee was constituted with a clear mandate to meet with all party stakeholders in every state to come up with a generally acceptable and people-based template for the smooth conduct of the Congresses and Convention.\u201d\n\nOn the party Constitution Amendment/Review, Buni said the committee constituted to look into ambiguities and loopholes to check unnecessary litigations and promote internal democracy has concluded its assignment after conducting public hearings in all the six geo-political zones with 500 memoranda received from party members.\n\nBesides, Buni said, the CECPC has taken over the ownership of the building housing the APC National Secretariat and approved the naming of the the National Secretariat after Buhari.\n\nBuhari said at the meeting that the party must espouse transparency and adhere to democratic principles to survive.\n\nHe spoke of his desire, as well as that of other leaders of the party to leave a legacy of transparency behind.\n\nHe asked party members to support the CECPC in consolidating the achievements of the party.\n\nSaid he: \u201cNow the hard fact: I call on all members to continue to support the Caretaker Extraordinary Conversion Planning Committee as they are set to commence the concluding and the most critical aspect of their assignment: the task of consolidating on all the achievements that we have so far recorded is for all of us, to which we all must be committed.\n\n\u201cYou must remember that we all want to live behind a legacy of transparency and adherence to the democratic principles, which the party and the country need to survive and prosper.\u201d\n\nBuhari hailed the committee for reviving, energising and repositioning the APC for its national convention and future elections.\n\nHis words: \u201cWith the work done by the committee, the party has bounced back to life.\n\n\u201cWe are all living witnesses to the crisis that engulfed our great party, leading to multiple litigations and series of defections from the party, which unfortunately presented a feature of selfishness and division.\n\n\u201cAt some point, members doubted how you are going to face the country in a general election with such a mindless behaviour.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that with the coming of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its effective management of the affairs of the party and the pursuit of its mandate, the fighter has bounced back to life and the National Secretariat of our party has once again become a beehive of activities, as it used to be in the good old days before the crisis.\n\n\u201cI wish to assure you that your committee will continue to enjoy my support and that of other stakeholders to ensure that the conduct and outcome of the congresses and National Convention are done in a manner that conforms with our desire to leave indelible footprints of all-round development and a lasting legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nThe President assured the committee that it would continue to enjoy the support of all party stalwarts and members to complete its assignment with the actualization of the national convention and leave an indelible footprint.\n\nAt the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; and Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong.\n\nOthers were Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el\u2019Rufai; Governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nThe Caretaker Committee was inaugurated on June 25, 2020 in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomole led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nIt was initially billed to operate for six months.\n\nIts tenure was first extended for six months last December by an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nThe Caretaker Committee met on Wednesday to review its activities and consider inputs from state governors elected on the party\u2019s platform for the purpose of working out a time table for its congresses.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting was a follow up to Wednesday\u2019s\n\nIt is expected that the party\u2019s caretaker committees at all levels will give way to the executive councils that will emerge during the local government, state and zonal congresses.\n\nSenator Nwaoboshi defects to APC\n\nForty-eight hours after his suspension by the Delta State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Senator representing Delta North, Peter Nwaoboshi, on Friday joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, said Nwaoboshi\u2019s defection showed that the effort of the APC CECPC was yielding fruit.\n\nHe was introduced to Buhari and the CECPC by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nIn suspending Nwaoboshi on Wednesday, Delta State PDP spokesman Ifeanyi Osuoza said the action was necessitated by the \u201crecent romance with an opposition party, verbal recklessness and unprovoked utterances of the lawmaker, particularly against the person of the state governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa.\u201d\n\nNwaoboshi had dismissed his suspension as satirical, hurriedly done, and a laughable caricature.\n\nHe said: \u201cCuriously, this irrational, laughable, illegal and unconstitutional action of this bunch of alarmingly anti-democratic forces masquerading as the State Working Committee is against the principles of fair hearing as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution; a document that supersedes all other documents.\u201d",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation/AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna/Alao Abiodun\n\nGumi denies arrest, explains why he was in DSS office\n\nSays I meet bandits with security officials as back-up\n\nThe Department of State Security Service (DSS), Kaduna quizzed Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmed Gumi following his recent television interview in which he claimed soldiers were supplying arms and ammunition to bandits terrorizing parts of the country.\n\nHowever, Gumi denied on Friday that he was invited or arrested, saying he was at the DSS office there for routine consultation on how to halt banditry in the Northwest.\n\nThe Army had warned Gumi on Wednesday that it \u201cshould not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals.\u201d\n\nSpokesman for the DSS, Peter Afunaya, told Channels Television on Friday that the agency indeed invited Gumi for questioning.\n\n\u201cSheikh Gumi was invited by the Service,\u201d Afunaya said.\n\nHe added: \u201cit is not out of place for it to invite any person of interest.\u201d\n\nBut he did not say why Gumi was invited.\n\nI was not invited, was not arrested, says Gumi\n\nContacted on Friday, Gumi denied being invited or arrested by the DSS.\n\nHe said he was only in communication with the security agency.\n\nHe said he was with the DSS director in Kaduna State in continuation of consultation on how to check banditry.\n\nHe said his meetings with bandits were always with the knowledge and backing of security agencies.\n\nHe pleaded with Nigerians to work for the unity and peace of this nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis spokesman, Tukur Mamu said Gumi met with the DSS director in Kaduna State for only 15 minutes on Thursday.\n\nIt was learnt that Gumi was invited because of his comments that some elements in the military and security agents were aiding banditry.\n\nGumi, who spoke with our correspondent on the phone, shortly after his weekly Tafsir (Exegesis of Quran) , said he was in his house in Kaduna as at 5.46pm.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was no arrest. I am in contact with all the security agencies. I am only in communication.\n\n\u201cI have never ventured into the forests without their escorts and their men with me and state officials, traditional rulers and Fulani traditional leaders.\n\n\u201cSo, it is a continuation of consultations as we carry on our missions.\n\n\u201cAll you are hearing is not true. There was no any invitation or arrest. I told you I was in communication with them before we started going to the bush.\n\n\u201cI have been with the authorities, I never went there alone. Look at all the video recordings, you will see all the police and security officials.\n\nGumi was optimistic that Nigeria will overcome its security challenges.\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians should come together. We can overcome all the difficulties we are facing. \u201d\n\nOn his part, the spokesman for Gumi, Mallam Tukur Mamu, who is also the publisher of Desert Herald, said: \u201cThe most important news is that Sheikh Gumi has not been arrested. There was nothing like arrest during the entire process.\n\n\u201cAbout invitation or lack of invitation or whether he was at DSS office in Kaduna or not, I think that should not even be the issue. Anybody can be a guest at the DSS office. And as a Nigerian and as somebody that respects constituted authority, any invitation granted to him by any authority, the Sheikh will be willing to always go.\n\n\u201cNigerians should understand that even before this development, Sheikh Gumi has been interacting with the police, the DSS and even the Army.\n\n\u201cSo, he has interacted with the highest authority of the Army even recently in Kaduna when they came for an event. So, there is nothing wrong, for example, for him visiting the DSS office. And they used to advise each other. He used to offer his own advice to them, even to the highest authority, on what he believes is the best approach to follow.\n\n\u201cAs officials, they also have their own advice for him. They also used to give him advice. And it is always in the interest of peace and in the interest of the whole nation.\n\n\u201cI think what I can confirm with the highest authority is that the Sheikh is at home. In fact, we just finished one of his weekly programmes of Tafsir and there is nothing like arrest at all.\n\n\u201cI think that should be the issue of concern on whether he was arrested or not.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of invitation as I said, he wasn in the DSS office yesterday (Thursday) for about 15 minutes and it was a direct contact between him and the State Director of DSS and nothing more.\u201d\n\nA source said Gumi was invited because of his comments that some elements in the military and security agents were involved in banditry.\n\nThe source said: \u201cSheikh was invited over his comments on Arise TV News that some elements in the military have been auding bandits.\n\n\u201d I think the Army did not go through the content of the interview before issuing their statement on Gumi. The Arise TV News also clarified on Thursday that Gumi mentioned some elements.\n\n\u201cGumi\u2019s position has been amplified by the statement of the Nigerian Army which claimed that they are not ruling out the possibility of bad elements among them.\u201d\n\nNews of Gumi\u2019s alleged invitation by the DSS was broken by the Hausa Service of Voice of America (VOA)\n\nAccording to the VOA, Gumi was invited by the Kaduna office of the DSS after the military authorities took exception to comments by him alleging that their operatives were conniving with bandits.\n\nReacting to Gumi\u2019s television allegations on Wednesday, army spokesman, Bigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu said contrary to the cleric\u2019s claims, the NA \u201cremains a bonafide symbol of national unity that has conducted its constitutional responsibilities in the most professional manner in line with global best practices of adherence to the rules of engagement and protection of the fundamental human rights of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe sweeping allegation peddled by the scholar is not only sad and unfortunate, but a calculated attempt to denigrate the Nigerian military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops, who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country. It is essential to remind ourselves that these same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yawuri from kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\n\u201cIt must also be pointed out, that while the military is very much receptive to constructive criticism, it should not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals. It is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of distabilization, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nGumi had met with over 500 armed bandits in Zamfara State on February 2, 2021 to negotiate for the release of the over 300 boys were abducted from Government Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State,.\n\nHe also stepped in when dozens of students were kidnapped at Government Science College (GSC) Kagara, Niger State.\n\nGumi later called for blanket amnesty for all the bandits, arguing that the federal government had done the same to Niger Delta militants during the Yar\u2019Adua presidency.",

          "text": "By Kunle Akinrinade\n\nHow police ICT unit tracked suspect\n\nDetained father released\n\nA video believed to be the last moments of the murdered Super TV chief executive officer, Usifo Ataga, and his lover, Chidinma Ojukwu, in a restaurant has gone viral.\n\nChidinma, a 21-year-old undergraduate of the University of Lagos, told on Thursday how she stabbed Ataga to death in their love nest in Lagos.\n\nAnother video has also emerged of her in what is said to be her shop at Yaba, Lagos, chatting and laughing with two young men.\n\nHer neighbours at Yaba were still in shock yesterday that \u201ca very withdrawn girl who usually kept to herself and had few friends,\u2019\u2019 could do what she claimed to have done.\n\nHer father, who was arrested for resisting her arrest, was released by the police yesterday.\n\nIn the first video, both lovers are seen walking into the restaurant and then take their seat in a corner, eating and drinking.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt a point, Ataga picks tissue paper to clean his lips.\n\nIn the other video, Chidinma is seen chatting with two young men, one of whom is visible. He holds a bottle of beer, laughing. The other man does not come on camera, but his voice is audible.\n\nHe is heard appreciating Chidinma\u2019s poise and voice and seems to be encouraging her to go into broadcasting.\n\nChindinma replies in pidgin English: \u201cdis no be studio-o,\u201d followed by laughter by the trio.\n\nNeighbours of the Ojukwus at their 57, Akinwunimi Street, Alagomeji, Yaba, home were still wondering yesterday how \u201ca very withdrawn girl who usually kept to herself and had few friends\u2019\u2019 could have killed anyone.\n\nOne of the neighbours, who does not want her name in print, said she observed that Chidinma suddenly started \u201cliving large.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2019She lived with her family in a block of flat at 57 Akinwunmi Street, Alagomeji, Yaba, Lagos. However, people in the neighbourhood later started noticing that she was living large and using expensive phones and other expensive items beyond what they could explain,\u2019\u2019 she said\n\nA close associate of Ataga is not convinced by Chidinma\u2019s account of how the murder took place.\n\nThe man, who also does not want his name in print, said: \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t believe she just stabbed Ataga to death like that, because the man was a trained boxer.\n\n\u201cI believe that it is possible she drugged him before slashing him with a knife. I say this without any prejudice to the ongoing investigation of the matter by police, because if Usifo (Ataga) was on drugs and did not know what he was doing, how come the lady who claimed she took drugs together with Ataga was not weakened by the effect of the drug, so much so that she had the energy to thrust knife into the body of the deceased several times?\n\n\u2018\u2019It looks like a premeditated murder because Usifo (Ataga) that we knew, an amateur boxer, would have disarmed the young lady if he was not sedated. I strongly believe that diligent investigation by police would put a final lie to the strange confession of the lady in question.\u2018\u2019\n\nThe Nation learnt that the suspect\u2019s father arrested when operatives tried to apprehend the lady has since been released from custody.\n\nSources at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Panti, Yaba, Lagos said the lady\u2019s father was arrested for obstructing operatives from arresting his daughter was released shortly after her daughter narrated how she killed Ataga.\n\n\u201cWe have since released her (suspect\u2019s) father from custody. The man was actually arrested for obstructing our men from arresting his daughter. But he became heartbroken after the girl confessed in his presence that she actually killed the man (Ataga),\u201d the police source said.\n\nThe source also said that the owner of the three-bedroom apartment where the crime was committed at Lekki had also been freed.\n\n\u2018\u2019We have also released the owner of the apartment because it was discovered that he leased out the apartment and was not involved in the crime,\u2019\u2019 the source said.\n\nHow police ICT unit tracked suspect\n\nThe Lagos State Police Command in an update yesterday on the Ataga murder said Chindinma\u2019s arrest was made possible by its recently created Information and Communication Technology unit.\n\nSpokesman for the command, Muyiwa Adejobi, in a statement entitled \u2018Lagos Security: Police Go Tough On Armed Robbers, Miscreants\u2019 said the unit tracked suspect, who used different SIM cards \u2013 both Nigerian and foreign ones.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, recently established ICT/Tracking Unit at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba-Lagos, to adopt scientific and forensic measures of unraveling crimes and criminality in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe unit, named D23, headed by SP Kasumu Rilwan, a computer scientist, has been instrumental to the landmark achievements and many feats recorded by the command under the watch of CP Hakeem Odumosu, including the latest arrest of the prime suspect in the alleged murder of Mr Michael Usifo Ataga, one Chidimma Adaora Ojukwu on 23rd June, 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Commissioner of Police recently created two Squads, the Special Squad and the Strike Team, at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja-Lagos, to complement the existing department and units of the command in combating crimes in the state. The new Squads, as well, have played many roles in suppressing and keeping criminals and hoodlums at bay in Lagos State.\u201d\n\nChidinma is expected to be charged to court \u201cas soon as investigation is concluded.\u201d",

          "title": "Face to face with alleged murderer of super tv CEO",
          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh And Kate Halim\n\nChidinma Adaora Ojukwu, the 21-year-old girl and 300-level student of Mass Communication, University of Lagos, suspected of murdering Usifo Ataga, Chief Executive Officer, SuperTV, has, in an exclusive interview with Saturday Sun, opened up on her life trajectory that led into the heinous crime.\n\nOjukwu who spoke to our reporters at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Lagos, where she is currently being held pending the conclusion of investigation into the alleged murder and her formal charge to court, revealed, not only how she dropped out of school because of poverty but also the fact that she comes from a broken home. Asked about her mum, she said: \u201cMy dad raised me. I don\u2019t have contact with my mom. We don\u2019t talk. I have an older sister and a younger sister.\u201d\n\nOther things she told Saturday Sun include how she went into the life of drugs. Her fellow students who spoke to our paper expressed shock over her involvement with the cold-blooded murder of the TV entrepreneur. But the girl who regrets her action advises other ambitious girls to learn from her mistake.\n\nWhat Chidinma told Saturday Sun\n\nWhen the suspect was interviewed, she revealed that the last time she visited campus was before the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. As she explained, this was because there was no money for her to go back to school to continue her education pursuit.\n\nShe was also asked what the so-called \u201cRoofies\u201d was. She had taken the substance, along with Ataga, and that spiked up the man\u2019s libido and made him to start pursuing her all over the place, including around the kitchen cabinet and demanding for another round of sex, even when she was too tired to engage in such act. She revealed that it is a street lingo for Rophynol. She confessed that she started taking drugs at a party she attended one year ago. \u201cThe first time I took it, I wasn\u2019t myself. But I continued taking it because my body later got used to it. It makes me feel high\u201d, she added.\n\nAsked what the drug Rohypnol is used for, she said that it makes one feels high so much \u201cyou can do things you have never done before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Roofies\u2019 at a glance\n\nDuring her confession, Chidinma alleged that the deceased gave her Roofies about an hour before the unfortunate incident. Experts contacted by Saturday Sun confirm that roofies is a street name for Rohypnol. It is also known as \u201cForget-me pill,\u201d \u201cMexican Valium\u201d and date rape drug.\n\nBut as a tranquilizer, it is about ten times more potent than Valium. The drug is available as a white or olive-green pill and is usually sold in the manufacturer\u2019s bubble packaging. Users crush the pills and snort the powder, sprinkle it on marijuana and smoke it, dissolve it in a drink or inject it.\n\nRohypnol, they say, has been used to commit sexual assaults because it renders the victim incapable of resisting, giving it the reputation of a \u201cdate-rape\u201d drug. Its users often describe its effects as \u201cparalyzing.\u201d The effect starts 20 to 30 minutes after taking the drug and peaks within two hours. But it may persist for eight or even 12 hours. A person can be so incapacitated (made unable to act), that they collapse. They lie on the floor, eyes open, able to observe events but completely unable to move. Afterwards, memory is impaired and they cannot recall any of the things that happened. The person may experience loss of muscle control, confusion, drowsiness and amnesia. The drug is sold in Europe and Latin America as a sleeping pill, but it is illegal in the United States and Nigeria.\n\nThe real me\n\n\u2013Chidinma\n\nBut the suspect, who looked sober, also took the opportunity to talk about herself when she is not under the influence of drugs. She described herself as an introvert who goes to clubs to unwind once in a while. She was raised in Ilasa, Lagos by her uncle and aunty, she said. She attended Government Primary School.\n\nFor her secondary school education, she attended Alagomeji Secondary School, Yaba, Lagos, but initially stopped at Junior Secondary School 2 owing to paucity of fund. She later went back and continued from Senior Secondary School 1 but also stopped again due to lack of finance. She later managed to complete her secondary school education. She wrote SSCE and UTME and gained admission into the University of Lagos where she was studying Mass Communication before the incident.\n\nChidinma revealed that her dad is an accountant while her mom is a trader. Her parents are not together, she informed our reporters. They have been separated for a long time. Looking downcast, she talks about deeply regretting her action. She said that she wouldn\u2019t have done what she did if she had the opportunity to go back in time.\n\nShe advised young girls to face their education and try to live a good and modest life so that they don\u2019t end up with the wrong crowd like she did. Questioned further on her love life, she said she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend and remarked that right now she is afraid of her future, given the consequence of her action in the face of the law.\n\nThe mood in her neighboourhood and department\n\nWhen our reporters visited her neighborhood at Alagomeji, Yaba, Lagos, where she lives with her father, they found everywhere quiet and seemingly deserted. Some of the neighbours who spoke to them stated that they were shocked to learn about her involvement with the alleged murder of the TV boss.\n\nAt the Mass Communication Department, University of Lagos, where she is a 300 level student, some students were seen going about their lectures while others were seen sitting in groups and discussing the development in hush tones.\n\nOne of her course-mates who identified herself as Anita told Saturday Sun how shocked she was to learn that the innocent-looking girl she described as \u201ccool and soft-spoken\u201d is now being linked with the murder of someone. She said although the accused has admitted committing the crime, she is still finding it difficult to believe that she did it, given all that she knows about her.\n\nAnita\u2019s words: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much. We just say hi to each other whenever we meet in the department. She is so gentle and doesn\u2019t seem capable of hurting a fly. She doesn\u2019t interact with many people because she keeps to herself a lot.\u201d\n\nA young man who identified himself as Godwin Udoh also said that the alleged action of Chidinma who he said has not been to class for some time came as a big shock to him. \u201cWhen I read the story, I couldn\u2019t believe that a soft-spoken, gentle and shy girl like Chidinma could kill a man stronger than she is,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think she\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d\n\nHer father is also shocked, Saturday Sun learnt. According to a police source, when detectives arrived his residence to arrest her, her father, believing that someone somewhere was either trying to frame her innocent daughter for murder that it might be a case of mistaken identity, tried to stop them from carrying out their duty. He put up stiff resistance. But somehow the operatives overpowered him and later had him arrested and taken into custody for trying to obstruct justice. But he has since been released.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Most times, I buy the biggest size and amend it especially the hands. Funny enough, I hardly wear bras even when going out. Most times, I feel all the guys that are wooing me are after my boobs.

          "title": "Me, 2Face, Faze and African Queen \u2013Blackface Naija, singer",
          "text": "By Bismark Maduka\n\nWith a career spanning nearly two decades, Afropop/dancehall singer, Ahmedu Augustine popularly known as Blackface Naija, has made his mark in the Nigerian entertainment industry.\n\nHe was a member of the Plantashun Boiz alongside 2Baba and Faze, and their band went on to become one of the best of the early 2000s. To Blackface\u2019s credits, he proved his mettle as a songwriter by writing almost all the songs in Plantashun Boiz\u2019s hugely successful debut album, Body and Soul.\n\nHowever, after the group\u2019s shocking split in 2004 as a result of 2Face\u2019s exit to pursue a solo career, Blackface released a solo album, Ghetto Child the same year. The album spunned hits like Hard Life and E Dey Pain Me. Other albums followed that made him a bonafide dancehall/reggae star. But then, his feud with 2Face over the rights to African Queen, a song they both co-wrote, seems to have driven a wedge between him and the public.\n\nNevertheless, signed to Loud Houz Entertainment, Blackface continues to make music and currently has in the market an album, Rising Sun (Volume 1&2). In this in-depth interview, the Benue State-born music star shares the highs and lows of his career. Please enjoy it.\n\nBriefly introduce yourself for the benefit of the younger generation that doesn\u2019t know you.\n\nI am Ahmedu Augustine. I\u2019m a singer, songwriter and performer. I was the one that has been the leader of the group, Plantashun Boiz. I\u2019m the one that created the group. I had some members in it like Faze and 2Face. But those members are not active in the band right now. I\u2019ve come a long way. I\u2019ve done about seven albums: Ghetto Child in 2004, Evergreen in 2005, Jungle Fever in 2006, Me, Music and I in 2008, and Dancehall Business in 2010. Since 2010, I didn\u2019t put any album out until 2015 when I released another album called Defender Volume 1. In 2020, I put out another album, Rising Sun, which is Defender Volume 2. Now I\u2019m ready to drop another album called, Rising Sun 2. So, I\u2019ve just been making music. I\u2019m one of the hottest artistes right now from Africa, if you check it properly.\n\nYou started making music before the social media era, and now most new school artistes rely on social media to promote their works. Somehow it influences the listeners and the charts. How have you been able to adjust to this new era?\n\nIf you say everything is online and that\u2019s what they use to sell music in this new era, there\u2019s no difference. The only thing is just put our own music on those platforms so that people can get them as well. Because the music of yesteryears is still important to us today. So, we\u2019re not saying like the new era came and they are doing online, so the other people are not really doing their own bit. We are doing our own bit. It\u2019s just that in my old case, they\u2019ve had some people say, \u2018Oh, is it Blackface? Oh, we don\u2019t want to work with you because you\u2019re working with Blackface.\u2019 And that has really been the thing that\u2019s been going on since they plotted and planned that agenda against me a long time ago for no reason. So, even if I want to work with video directors now, that\u2019s the latest one to say, \u2018Oh, is it Blackface? We don\u2019t want to work with you\u2019. So, I don\u2019t know why they put their eyes on me and try to slow my roll. And that\u2019s factual.\n\nSo, that could be the reason why you don\u2019t collaborate as often as you used to do in the past?\n\nNo, that could be the reason why people don\u2019t see my music for them to be able to download just immediately. Because the people that are working in some of these companies will not let them put my music out so that people can download it and I can make a living off making music. So, platforms try to make themselves like it\u2019s only us that will be on the platform, and no other person is going to come unto the platform, and then shut every other person out. So, that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve been operating against me over the years. The video directors don\u2019t want to work for me, even if I\u2019m willing to pay them.\n\nIt\u2019s been that bad for me. But then it\u2019s all good. Because if I wasn\u2019t built for that to happen, I don\u2019t think it would be happening. I\u2019m to make that change and make people realize that that kind of attitude towards targeting a particular artiste, and trying to silence them or cancel them is a bad thing.\n\nI remember your song, Ahead of The Game where you featured Mallam Spicy and Rocksteady. The track was huge that year\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) Even till now. Believe you me, there\u2019s no song in Nigeria that is bigger than Ahead of The Game. All the other artistes that came into the music industry know that there\u2019s only one sound, which is still here and nobody\u2019s gonna surpass it, and I\u2019m still here.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you collaborate as often as you used to do in the past?\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between the artistes I work with. I don\u2019t always work with those people because they\u2019re not on my team. I have my own team I work with. And just the way it was when I started the Plantashun Boiz; I didn\u2019t just go and say, \u2018Yo, because there was Daddy Showkey or Baba Fryo before me, my music will sell by featuring them\u2019. I never did that. I did my own music, regardless of the people that were there and I made an impact. So, it\u2019s the same thing for me right now. I don\u2019t think I need the artistes to make the impact. I make the music for the love of it.\n\nIf Omah Lay for example reaches out to you that he wants to work with you, are you open to such collaboration?\n\nMy phones are open. They can call me if they want to work with me. But the thing is, before I work with you, the music has to be of substance, because I don\u2019t do freelance features. I don\u2019t do freestyle because I may have to be involved in writing or something else about the music. So, before I do that, I need to be sure of what it is; and if it\u2019s a full project or a single, I\u2019ve got to discuss the details. If I like the song, then we go. It\u2019s not even about money, let\u2019s talk about the music first.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the new school Nigerian artistes?\n\nI want them to understand that music is a tool, they should use it for positive messages. They should use it for messages that will affect the youth positively like the way it used to be. Put the right lyrics that will be of positive influence to society. Music is a big tool. There are some things you can do with it, so we should be careful how we use it.\n\nBut sometimes they need to entertain too\u2026\n\nBut you can\u2019t overdo it. If you do it too many times then it becomes a part of you. If you do it like, now you want to entertain, and then you go back to consciousness, that\u2019s good. You can\u2019t just be on a mad train nonstop.\n\nIs there any misconception about you that you really need to correct?\n\nYou know what they do, they use the media against you when you are a target for them. They spent all the money they\u2019re supposed to use to develop and help their people to pay the media to write bad about you.\n\nWho do you think is behind all these specifically?\n\nI don\u2019t know the people and I don\u2019t know what their aim is. Now, this is the third Instagram page I\u2019m on. They\u2019re trying to silence me, they\u2019re trying to cancel me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to make you understand. I had the first one (Instagram page), it went up to about 17,000 followers, they hacked it and took it off because I had some truth there. So many truths I spoke there that people would like to read and also see my artistic growth; how I started and how I\u2019m doing now, which would have been a whole long library. I started another one again and it had like 30,000 followers, they took it down again. And now, I\u2019ve opened a new one called, The Real Blackface Naija.\n\nWhat do you feel these people stand to gain? What\u2019s their motive?\n\nThey want to propagate a lie, they know I would come with the truth. They want to propagate a false agenda, they know I\u2019ll tell my people the equation. I\u2019m their major problem because they are agents of the dark.\n\nBut we\u2019re all human beings, you feel these words, these things they say\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t really care what they say. I\u2019m just waiting for them to have a one-on-one encounter with me before they can have a change of heart. The first thing they should know is that the song, African Queen, it was me that wrote it and told 2Face to sing it.\n\nYou mean African Queen wasn\u2019t written together with anyone?\n\nIt was not written together with anyone. It was me that wrote it, even though it was like the two of us should do it, I was already doing it. You understand what I mean? I was already doing the song. Like, dem give two of una assignment but you don already dey do the assignment. All that was left was to do a presentation. It\u2019s me that told him to record the song. If I didn\u2019t ask him to record the song, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use the song. I didn\u2019t hate him. I\u2019ve already listened to his album before I said, \u2018you know, this album, this is the way it sounds like, but this is the song that will make your album go to the next level\u2019. So, nobody should be thinking, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m hating on 2Face\u2019. No, 2Face is my town brother. All I did was say, \u2018you can sing this song\u2019. And they were wrong in the sense that they didn\u2019t put my name on it. I don\u2019t hate him.\n\nThere\u2019s this rumour that things are not the way they were in the past for you, that you\u2019re not doing well. I\u2019d like you to speak on that.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s a standard that they have in their heads of how they expect me to be. Maybe they want to see me with posh cars, they want to see me living in Lekki or Banana Island, they want to see me like a superstar that they know I am. But how\u2019s that going to happen when all these people are cutting me off? They know what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019m trying to keep my head above the water. With time, they\u2019ll see me in some light. I don\u2019t have to worry about standards and I\u2019m just living my life. They shouldn\u2019t worry, with time they\u2019ll see me in a Rolls Royce. And then I will be able to reach out to my people in Benue State and do some foundation things.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most memorable moment in your career?\n\nThat\u2019ll be the first time I went to Makurdi, I went to my secondary school, Mount Saint Gabriel\u2019s. The students knew me and were so excited and didn\u2019t want me to leave the school. That day was also a show. On arriving at the venue, the stadium; when the people saw me, it was like Nigeria scored a goal. It was so awesome. And when I was on the stage singing they applauded, I was having that feeling like \u2018wow, these guys are really feeling my music for them to respond to my rhymes\u2019. That was around 2008.\n\nYour song, Hard Life was widely played during the EndSars protest. How did it make you feel?\n\nI didn\u2019t worry much. I already knew the impact of the song and I already knew the reason why I made the song in 2003. And the song is crying to the government that \u2018please, we need a change. We need something positive to happen for the people\u2019 because life in Nigeria was too hard in 2003. And imagine how many years it took before they were able to recognize it.\n\nBecause in the long run, even when they play the song they don\u2019t want the artiste there. The radio will not play the song. That was supposed to be song of the year when it was released in 2004, and Ghetto Child was supposed to be the album of the year. But they didn\u2019t give me any award. Since I\u2019ve been doing music, I\u2019ve not had any award from the music industry. I want you to understand how the politics in the industry plays out. We are the ones that\u2019ll be talking about so many things the government should do better for the people. But in the long run, when they wanted to go on a protest, what did they do? They took people that are not even social crusaders, people that their music are talking about \u2018Yahoo Yahoo\u2019. Those are the people they\u2019re pushing forward to talk to the people. What are they going to tell the people? What idea do you think they have? We are the ones that\u2019ll be fighting for the people but they don\u2019t want us to be heard. But all of a sudden they\u2019re trying to use that music to propagate their own agenda. It was funny to me.\n\nHave you received your share of the royalties from the song, African Queen? There was a time you guys went to court over the issue. Has it been resolved?\n\nLet me give you an overview of African Queen. African Queen has so many covers by different artistes. I\u2019ve been on the calm side taking things easy. So many people have used African Queen in different television programmes and commercials, of which legally, I\u2019m supposed to know. But now, so many people have laid claims to the music like they own it. Meanwhile, they don\u2019t own the music. Some of these people are outside the country. So, this issue goes beyond 2Face himself. We are getting to the bottom of it. When everything has been worked out, I\u2019ll give a press statement and people will have a clear picture of where we are right now. I can\u2019t tell you too much because these are supposed to be for the lawyers.\n\nBut 2Face particularly didn\u2019t list you on the song\u2019s credits, I think?\n\nYes, but when I told his team to credit me they said they were going to do it, which they didn\u2019t do. But later, I was able to get confirmation from him that I wrote the song, and we shared the rights to his version that was released and published by Kennis Music. We shared the proceeds 50/50 percent. Since then, it is known internationally that the African Queen version that was performed by 2Face Idibia, we have a 50/50 percent cut from it. So, that has been sorted out. All that\u2019s left is for us to talk about backdated royalties.\n\nThere was a time you had issues with your former bandmates for performing some of Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs. Has that been sorted out too?\n\nPlantashun Boiz is a brand and I don\u2019t want anybody tampering with the brand name. If Faze wants to perform, let him go out and perform as Faze. If 2Face wants to perform, let him go out and perform as 2Face. Unless I tell them I\u2019m not going to be available, then both of them can perform Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs.\n\nThey may have their own shows and could decide to do a throwback on fans\u2019 request.\n\nThis particular band is restricted from doing that, because they might collect money for the band and collect for themselves as well. If I\u2019m on tour and the fans say they want Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs, most definitely, I must get my former bandmates to come in. If I can\u2019t get them to come in, sorry I can\u2019t represent the music in a half way.\n\nAny plan of Plantashun Boiz getting back together to make music?\n\nThe Plantashun Boiz is independent of Blackface Naija, Faze and 2Face. Regardless of these people, the name Plantashun Boiz is going to be in existence. The band is going to be releasing music for the fans.\n\nPersonally, I want to see the former members make new records together.\n\nLike I always say, the first cut is the deepest. The first impression is what\u2019s really holding everybody back. But the thing is, everybody is subject to exploring their talent. These individuals (2Face and Faze) have decided to explore their talents, who am I to stop them? I\u2019m getting some young boys, R&B singers to be the new faces of Plantashun Boiz. It doesn\u2019t have to be the original members all the time.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with your former bandmates?\n\nEverybody is still where they are. I just released my new single, Mathematics, they\u2019ve not called to congratulate me. I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re caught up in their own music, I wish them all the best.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship status?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m married to my music.\n\nI mean is there anybody in your life?\n\nEven, if I have somebody in my life, I don\u2019t want to tell you people. The last person in my life, they did everything to try to spoil it. I don\u2019t want anybody to know about this one.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",
          "summary": "He was a member of the Plantashun Boiz alongside 2Baba and Faze, and their band went on to become one of the best of the early 2000s.\nSo, I don\u2019t know why they put their eyes on me and try to slow my roll.\nI don\u2019t know the people and I don\u2019t know what their aim is.\nThere was a time you had issues with your former bandmates for performing some of Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs.\nThe Plantashun Boiz is independent of Blackface Naija, Faze and 2Face.",

          "text": "\u2022Says crisis-ridden party back to life\n\n\u2022Dates for congresses at all levels ratified\n\nDeji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has granted another six months tenure extension to the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe President gave the approval yesterday morning after a closed-door meeting with members of the Committee at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSources said the Buni-led committee requested for another six months tenure extension after doing 12 months, to enable them \u201cput the party in very good shape and conduct a seamless elective National Convention.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Buni presented a summary of the Committee\u2019s progress report to the President at the meeting.\n\nThe Chairman was accompanied to the meeting with the President by other members of the committee \u2013 Governor Isiaka Oyetola of Osun State, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, Ken Nnamani, Abubakar Yusuf, Akinyemi Olaide, Mrs. Stella Oketete, Dr. James Lulu, Chief David Lyon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed and the committee\u2019s Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, in a statement after the meeting, said the President approved the tenure extension after a detailed consideration of the progress report, the schedule of outstanding activities with regards to congresses, the National Convention and the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship election.\n\nHe said by virtue of the extension, the tenure of the caretaker committees at each level from wards, local governments, states and national, would end immediately elections were held at their respective levels with officers immediately take oath of office, terminating with the National Convention.\n\nThe secretary recalled that at its last meeting, the National Executive Committee (NEC) conferred on the Committee, the power of the National Convention, \u201cwhich is in line with powers provided in Article 13.3 of the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated: \u201cPresident Buhari on Friday approved the review of the timelines available to the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cThe President also approved the timetable for APC Ward, Local Government and State Congresses. Ward Congresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by Local Government Congresses on 14th August, 2021 and State Congresses on 18th September, 2021.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that Buni informed the President that the Committee had during the period under review, led the party to contest in several elections and bye-elections, with an overall success rate of 95 per cent.\n\nOn the peace and reconciliation efforts, he said the Chairman informed the President that the committee commenced its assignment with the desire to foster genuine reconciliation on solid foundation, by giving all issues and every aggrieved member fair hearing and objectively placing party interests above individual interests.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to state that the party is now more peaceful, more accommodating, and more united with greater prospects than when we came on board,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling Buhari.\n\nOn the Anambra governorship election, the secretary stressed that the chairman notified the President that 14 aspirants indicated interest to contest the election through purchase of expression of interest and nomination forms, and that all of them had been cleared by the Screening Committee as eligible to contest.\n\nHe added: \u201cAmong other achievements in the CECPC\u2019s administration of the party, the National Chairman informed the President that \u201cthe CECPC inherited liability of unpaid legal fee to the tune of N340 million, but successfully negotiated and brought down the fees to N179 million which is now fully paid.\u201d\n\nThe secretary added that the Chairman informed the President that the Committee had been very cautious and meticulous in making arrangements to conduct credible, transparent, flawless and generally acceptable congresses and convention for the party to produce a strong leadership that will enjoy the support, trust and confidence of all members.\n\n\u201cAt all times, we have enjoyed the confidence of Mr. President and enjoyed your leadership. In developing the timetable for the congresses and convention, the support to conduct a credible election cannot be over-emphasised; this will also justify the successes recorded and the status of the new APC that we have all dreamt of,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling the President.\n\nDuring the meeting at the State House, President Buhari took a holistic look at the activities of the APC in recent times and concluded that the party, which was crisis ridden, had been revived and now fully back to life.\n\nHe, therefore, congratulated the Mala Buni-led committee for its task to return the party from a comatose state to proper reorganisation at all levels.\n\nThe President said the APC had been revived, energised and repositioned for its forthcoming national convention and future elections.\n\nAccording to him, the fortunes of the party had been brightened by the re-organisation and reconciliation of members across the party, saying \u201cwith the work done by the committee the party has bounced back to life.\n\n\u201cI have listened with great interest to the remarkable job you have done so far. We are all witnesses to the crisis that engulfed the party leading to litigations and presented a picture of selfishness and division,\u201d said the President.\n\nPresident Buhari said the party\u2019s structure was disturbed by the conflicts that preceded and followed various elections, noting that the secretariat had been witnessing a beehive of peaceful activities after the reconciliation.\n\nThe President said: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that with the coming of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its effective management of the affairs of the party and the pursuit of its mandate, the party has bounced back to life and the National Secretariat of our party has once again become a beehive of activities, as it used to be in the good old days before the crisis.\u201d\n\nThe President told members of the committee that they would continue to enjoy the support of all party stalwarts and members to complete their assignment with the actualisation of the convention and leave an \u201cindelible footprint\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI wish to assure you that your committee will continue to enjoy my support and that of other stakeholders to ensure that the conduct and outcome of the congresses and National Convention are done in a manner that conforms with our desire to leave indelible footprints of all-round development and a lasting legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of APC Caretaker Committee said they approached their duty with commitment and dedication to rescue the party from imminent collapse.\n\nThe Yobe State Governor noted that all issues and members were given a fair hearing, and an open-door policy was created to accommodate all those that were aggrieved, leading to withdrawal of cases in court and peaceful settlements.\n\n\u201cWe are currently witnessing high powered decamping to our party, including governors from the PDP. The party is now more peaceful, orderly and accommodating than what we met on the ground. Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitisation was able to allay the fears of members,\u201d Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nHe told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organised recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria will continue frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero emissions\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo is worried about the global clamour for green energy and the looming reduction in funding for gas and fossil fuel projects, especially in developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAs a result, he summoned a virtual meeting on the subject last Thursday, with other top federal government officials in attendance; including the Ministers of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar; Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy Agba, and the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Bitrus Bako Nabasu.\n\nAt the virtual meeting, Osinbajo maintained his position that the funding for gas and fossil fuel projects in Nigeria and other developing countries be sustained during the global transition to net-zero emissions and said Nigeria would continue its frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nHe also asserted that Nigeria would play a critical role with other gas exporting countries to stop the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects in developing countries.\n\nThe Vice President noted that it was vital that the Forum of Gas Exporting Countries (GEC) join forces to prevent the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects, especially from developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAccording to the VP, concrete steps should be taken by the GEC Forum to stop further plans by international bodies and Western countries on defunding of gas/fossil fuel projects as it does not benefit developing countries especially.\n\nHe noted that it was vital Nigeria plays a significant role in achieving a consensus with the GEC Forum on these issues, even as the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) scheduled to hold later this year approaches.\n\nIn the same vein, the Vice President asked the Inter-ministerial committee on Climate Change, led by the Federal Ministry of Environment, to finetune Nigeria\u2019s position for COP26, while the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources would focus on strengthening the country\u2019s strategy, particularly in its initiative to use gas as a transition fuel.\n\nBoth the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Minister of Foreign Affairs were directed to work together, to ensure the GEC Forum reaches a consensus that reflects Nigeria\u2019s advocacy on defunding of gas projects.\n\nBefore now, Osinbajo had, at different forums in the past months, raised the issue of financing of gas projects in developing countries, especially Nigeria, advocating a just transition and more effective engagements since the campaign for the net-zero emission by 2050 resumed.\n\nIn March this year, at a meeting with a delegation from the European Union (EU), led by its Executive Vice President, Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis, the VP reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the global green energy initiative, but called for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nAt another meeting held in February with the British Member of Parliament and COP26 President-Designate, Mr. Alok Sharma, Osinbajo restated Nigeria\u2019s support and commitment to the Climate Change agreement, but cited the planned restrictions on financing of gas projects in African countries as a potential setback.\n\nAt the UN Dialogue on Food Systems, also in February, the Vice President stressed the need for the international community to consider, as an option, the use of gas and other more environmentally friendly fuel sources, as against what he termed \u201cdefunding gas projects\u201d based on gas not being environmentally friendly enough.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Charles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Kaduna State office of the Department of State Services, DSS, yesterday invited and questioned controversial cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, over his recent allegations, during an interview on Arise Television that some security agents were aiding and benefiting from bandits ravaging communities in the North.\n\nAt the DSS office, sources close to Gumi said he was questioned on his statement during the interview, \u201cand the cleric clarified his declaration, saying he did not accuse the entire military and other security agencies of aiding bandits but \u201cthe bad eggs in the security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe sources said the cleric was subsequently cautioned on his utterances by the DSS detectives and allowed to go home.\n\nSpokesman of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, confirmed the invitation of Gumi by the service, adding, \u201cIt may not be unconnected with his claim that security agencies were colluding with bandits in the spate of kidnapping for ransom afflicting the nation.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said further: \u201cGumi was invited as a person of interest. The service invited Sheikh Gumi. It is not out of place for it to invite any person of interest.\u201d\n\nDuring the Arise TV interview last Wednesday, the cleric, who is known to have access to the bandits, said: \u201cThese bandits, if you don\u2019t know, are cooperating with a lot of bad elements in our security system. This is a business. So many people are involved, you\u2019ll be so surprised.\n\n\u201cThey were caught in Zamfara; they were caught everywhere, how do these big weapons cross our borders? How can these big weapons cross our borders and get into the forest without the cooperation of some bad element of the security operatives assisting them? It\u2019s not possible. If I give you the same amount of guns, can you take them to the UK? You can\u2019t because the security is alert.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army kicked against the cleric\u2019s claims and warned that it would not condone acts sabotaging its efforts.\n\nOnyema Nwachukwu, the Army\u2019s spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is essential to remind ourselves that this same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yauri, from kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian Army will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel.\u201d\n\nAlso, Gumi\u2019s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, in an interview with the VOA yesterday, dismissed the allegation against Gumi, saying there was nowhere in the TV interview when the cleric categorically accused the entire military of aiding bandits.\n\nThe spokesman explained that what Gumi said was \u201cwhat people have been saying and even the soldiers have been saying is that there could be some bad eggs among them.\u201d\n\nGumi: I was Never Quizzed By DSS\n\nBut the Kaduna-based cleric yesterday evening debunked reports that he was either quizzed or invited for questioning by the DSS over his remarks on security agencies.\n\nSpeaking after presiding over a Jummat service at the Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna State, Sheikh Gumi said all his interventions with bandits inside the forest were done in collaboration with the support of the government and security agencies, hence he did not commit any offence.\n\n\u201cNobody Invited me for questioning or any arrest, I can say that categorically,\u201d the Sheik said, adding, \u201csince I ventured into the forest, I went there with full security, the police, with the knowledge of the DSS, traditional rulers and the Fulani leaders, I never went alone\u201d.\n\nHe also insisted that he never made any disparaging remarks against the military during his recent live interview on national television.\n\nAccording to him, there was nowhere in the TV interview that he categorically accused the entire military.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\nSee Also Insecurity Nigerians Call For Arrest Of Sheikh Gumi Over Cleric's 'Provocative' Comments, Stance On Banditry\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of distabilisation, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nGumi is known for making controversial statements regarding bandits and killer herdsmen.\n\nOn Wednesday, he had described bandits and killer herdsmen\u2019s atrocities as \u201ca tribal war,\u201d accusing the government of taking sides.\n\n\u201cWhat you call banditry when you cross to the other side, you find out Nigeria is fighting a tribal war,\u201d he explained.",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google earmarks $6 million to support African tech startups and women-led businesses",
          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "Despite the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in major cities in Nigeria, foreign investors are still able to sniff untapped opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s transport and motorcycle industry.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the motorcycles usually imported from India, China, Indonesia, and Japan contributed N416 billion to the total imports in 2020, this is however a 14 percent drop from the N486 billion it contributed in the same period of 2019. The drop may be attributed to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 2018, it achieved N204 billion, which represented an increase of 183 percent from the N72 billion realised in 2017; although data for the second quarter of 2017 was not available.\n\nAn example of manufacturers looking to tap into this market is Hero MotoCorp, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of motorcycles and scooters, which has made investments to tap from Nigeria\u2019s $153 million two-wheelers industry through its specially made-for-Nigeria motorcycle named Hunter.\n\nThe Indian manufacturer recognised an active market in Nigeria which required specific conditions, as the machine offers multiple benefits of modern technology, best mileage, longer engine life, and a comfortable long seat at an attractive introductory price.\n\nThe machine also has a metallic bash plate protecting the engine on rough roads, a combi-lock to protect it from theft, and tyre pressure monitoring indicator (accessory) to prevent deflation and puncture while on rugged terrains. Furthermore, it has an industry-first 12-month or 75,000km Engine Warranty.\n\nBeyond the production of machines for Nigerian conditions, the company affirms that it is looking to grow its presence in Nigeria through the establishment of various outlets.\n\nRead Also: Manufacturers urge enabling policies, actions to drive economic growth\n\nAnil Sahgal, managing director, Automotive Division, Kewalram Chanrai Group, the exclusive distributor of Hero MotoCorp in Nigeria, says while they focus on satisfying consumers, the company aims to significantly increase its presence in the Nigerian market\n\n\u201cHero MotoCorp is also planning to have almost forty outlets in twenty towns across Nigeria and will have a pan-country presence through dealers and parts distributors. In addition, an extensive network of over five thousand trained technicians pan-Nigeria will ensure easy access to service and parts for all customers. Powerful Ride, Smart Technology, Unmistakably Stylish,\u201d he states.\n\nIn recent years, the importation of motorcycles in Nigeria has been significantly driven by rising urbanisation, growing youth population, and increased businesses and investment.\n\nThis also presents an opportunity for more investors to come in as the Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report by Market Research reveals that the sector has a promising future in the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria two-wheeler market is projected to surpass $153 million by 2023. Growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria has been backed by their higher fuel efficiency and easy manoeuvrability.\n\n\u201cMoreover, their affordability coupled with rising prices of passenger cars are further anticipated to contribute to the growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria over the next five years,\u201d the report states\n\nEconomic experts believe that the coming of Hero will reduce the country\u2019s unemployment rate, which currently stands at 33 percent and in the same vein boosts economic activities through the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nFollowing the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in Lagos, the most populated and the busiest city in Nigeria, the ingenuity of Nigerians was piqued and this resulted in a boom in the logistics services industry.\n\nWith a minimum of N700 and a maximum of N3,000, depending on the location, urgency, and package, people can easily send and receive products in less than 24 hours. The sector has become increasingly competitive with the increase in the number of entrepreneurs, particularly online vendors.\n\nAlthough motorcycle imports have increased despite the ban, this has simply fuelled activities in the logistics industry. This has also prompted manufacturers of motorcycles like Hero MotoCorp to still see limitless opportunities in the Nigerian market.\n\nGoldStein Market Intelligence in its Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report reveals that as of 2019 Nigeria held the position of the second biggest market in Africa\u2019s two-wheeler industry; hence it has captured the attention of Chinese and Indian manufacturers\n\n\u201cNigeria represented the second-biggest offer in the African Two-Wheeler Market in 2019, this was due to insufficient public intra-city transport framework, expanding monetary action and rising interest for last-mile conveyance purpose,\u201d it states\n\nThe report also projects that the industry is also expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.31 percent.\n\nDespite the huge demand for motorcycles, Nigeria relies on the importation of Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts from Asian countries, which are assembled in the country.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Thursday launched the online Portal for the continuous voters registration exercise nationwide.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure at the national headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the register of voters is at the heart of democratic elections, stating that \u201ca good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. For this reason, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn exercising its powers under the law, the Commission undertook a fresh registration of eligible voters with every General Election until 2011 when the first reliable biometric register of voters was compiled. Thereafter, the Commission embarked on intermittent registration of voters on the eve of major elections. However, in April 2017, this Commission for the first time began the implementation of registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act. As a result, 14,283,734 new voters were added to the register by the time the process was suspended in August, 2018 in order to prepare for the 2019 General Election\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also said that, Monday 28th June 2021 remains sacrosanct, as the registration of voters will commence in full nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED). This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM)\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that in the Commission\u2019s determination to serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online. We hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience.\n\nThe exercise according to the Commission will be carried out continuously over a period of at least one year thereby, providing enough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. \u201cNo eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised, the chairman noted.\n\nThe chairman also allayed the fears expressed by some Nigerians that many citizens may be disenfranchised by the new digital arrangement pointing out that, the Commission is aware that not all Nigerians have computers, smart phones, access to the internet or residing in urban and sub-urban areas. Some citizens may also have one form of disability or another to make it impossible for them to register online.\n\nThe Commission, Yakubu said is also aware of its responsibility under the law to provide every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register irrespective of where they live or other circumstances of life. \u201cI wish to assure you that in addition to the online registration portal, there will be some 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically nationwide\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/ Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has declared that the current sufferings visited on Nigerians will make them to chase the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government out of power in 2023.\n\nThe governor made the assertion during the inauguration of Pabod Breweries By-Pass Road and Oginigba \u2013 Ordinance link road at Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt on Friday, which was performed by the former Nigeria\u2019s Senate President, Senator Iyorchia Ayu.\n\nWike noted that APC rode on social media propaganda that sounded so convincing at the time, but had since demonstrated how clueless they are in matters of governance.\n\nAccording to Wike, there is no amount of intimidation and threat that will make Nigerians to be deceived again, because they cannot afford to allow the sufferings to continue.\n\nHe said \u201cNigeria needs prayers to come out from this situation we find ourselves. Not that we wanted it so, but we gave a government, a party, that was not prepared to govern a chance. A party that came through propaganda, social media, lies; now we have seen what we have caused ourselves.\n\n\u201cThat was why you voted for them in 2015. Now look at the level of suffering, Look at how all of us are feeling today. Will you allow them use the social media to deceive us? The same people who used the social media are no longer happy with the social media.\u201d\n\nWike restated that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) remains the only hope of Nigeria to lead it out of the current woes.\n\nHe stated that Nigerians cannot afford to allow the mistakes of 2015 to repeat itself. According to him, another erroneous attempt to entrust APC with the responsibility of governance, will be disastrous for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe only hope Nigerians have is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). If Nigerians make the mistake again and allow these (APC) people in 2023, then you have dug your graves.\n\n\u201cI will not be a party to it. If you don\u2019t want to dig your grave, then make sure that by 2023 you chase them out.\u201d\n\nWike warned trailer trucks drivers against converting the just reconstructed road to a park as the State government will not hesitate to impound their trailers.\n\nSpeaking further, Wike said the Oginigba-Slaughter market located at the Trans-Amadi industrial layout cannot be allowed to operate without proper adherence to established rules.",

          "text": "By Doyin Adeyemo\n\n\u201cDepression? Never! I am too young for that\u201d. \u201cMental disorder? God forbid. It is not my portion\u201d. Myths. False assumptions. Misconceptions.\n\nIt is both alarming and surprising the number of myths that surround mental health, especially in this part of the world where we attach spiritual connotation to anything and everything. There are many stereotypes surrounding mental illness that are both harmful and stigmatizing.\n\nOne major misconception is that people with mental health challenges are unable to function in society. Every day, people dress up and go about their daily lives, completely undetected to be struggling. From the outside, they look completely normal. However on the inside, there is a battle ongoing.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no look to mental illness. A disheveled appearance isn\u2019t a symptom of mental illness. Another misconception among the general public is the belief that individuals with mental illness are dangerous to the society. These misconceptions are not accurate and they contribute to stigmatization.\n\nMental illness is a general term for a group of illnesses that may impact on a person\u2019s thoughts, perceptions, feelings and behavior. They include: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia and developmental disorders including autism.\n\nMany mental disorders are sever enough to impair a person\u2019s ability to function. In fact, for many mental health conditions, significant impairment is a diagnostic criterion. In some cases, a mental illness may be less severe, and although a person experiences symptoms, they are still able to function normally, most of the time. This hidden condition is colloquially known as high-functioning mental disorder. Some of which are depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder among others.\n\nHigh functioning mental illness is the term that has been adopted to describe those living with a mental illness that is almost undetectable. It covers a broad spectrum; they might have a job, be studying, dress well or even have the \u2018perfect\u2019 family lifestyle.\n\nThose characterized as high-functioning are less likely to ask for help because they are convinced nothing is wrong, or that their feelings are invalid. These individuals are often discouraged from seeking treatment, as they tend to be told \u201cbut you don\u2019t look like you are struggling\u201d by those they discuss their feelings with.\n\nImagine someone who seems to be living a perfect life. She has a great job, a loving and supportive partner and plenty of fun outside of work. Getting to the office on time is no problem and she is one of the most productive employees at work.\n\nThere\u2019s one problem though; she is miserable, unable to derive happiness from much of anything because she lives with high-functioning depression, it is difficult for people to understand how anything could be wrong.\n\nHigh-functioning mental illness can be characterized by the same diagnostic symptoms as anxiety and depression, but those with it manage their daily life as though nothing is wrong, and some even excel in certain areas.\n\nThe diagnosis for high-functioning depression is officially called Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). Some experts believe that the term high-functioning depression stems from lack of clarity of Persistent Depressive Disorder or as it is otherwise called, Dysthymia.\n\nAs this form of depression may be less intense than others, it allows a person to live a relatively normal life without appearing sick to other people. Common symptoms include: sleeping too much or too little, decreased appetite or overeating, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, trouble making decisions and feeling of hopelessness.\n\nThere is a lot of controversy surrounding high-functioning depression on whether it is a true medical diagnosis or not, however, the fact remains that it exists. Just because one is typically able to get out of bed and present as \u201cnormal\u201d to the world doesn\u2019t mean that one is not suffering.\n\nThe stigma surrounding depression and other high functioning mental conditions can make seeking help difficult. These stigma include the belief that only those with severe symptoms, such as inability to function in daily life or with suicidal thoughts require treatment.\n\nPeople often have a mental picture in their heads about what mental illness looks like, they think it looks like a complete inability to function; if the person is not roaming the streets or in the psychiatric hospital, then he\u2019s totally fine. This stigma can cause those with high-functioning depression to believe they should quietly tolerate their symptoms. However, high-functioning depression is a severe disorder that can be debilitating.\n\nGlobally, more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression. In Nigeria, one in four people suffer from sort of mental illness. According to WHO, Nigeria has Africa\u2019s highest case load of depression, and ranks 15th in the world in the frequency of suicide.\n\nA Mental Health in Nigeria Survey conducted by Africa Polling Institute (API), in partnership with EpiAfric in 2019, estimates that 20-30% of the Nigerian population are believed to suffer from mental health disorders. For a country filled with people that love life, this figure seems unbelievable but according to the report, \u201cthe reason for this high figure has been attributed to economic hardship, negative environmental externalities and the rising cost of decent living in the Country\u201d.\n\nThe advent of the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a surge of depression cases. The socio-economic inequalities resulting from job losses and other barriers including reduction of salaries, shortage of daily necessities, insecurity, separation from families, and loss of loved ones have been reported to worsen depression in Nigeria. With the high poverty rate of the country, and the difficulties faced by Nigerians every day, it is likely that the prevalence of depression among Nigerians will continue to increase.\n\nThe abysmal lack of mental health services, ignorance, shortage of qualified personnel, financial difficulties and stigmatization are some of the myriad of challenges usually faced in seeking and utilizing mental health services in Nigeria.\n\nThese challenges have long lasting consequences, as depressed patients who are untreated are more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and suicide. It is more worrisome because due to our culture in Nigeria, those who have high-functioning depression will be hesitant to speak up, some are even completely oblivious of their situation, a great number of them are forced to suffer in silence thereby causing a surge in the number of suicides.\n\nIn dealing with the menace of mental illness, it is important to address issues around prejudice and discrimination through sensitization and mobilization particularly through non-governmental organizations. Well-planned public awareness can help to reduce stigma and encourage people to seek help.\n\nMore mental health professionals should be properly trained and empowered to provide specialized care for people with mental illness. It is worthy to note that depression sometimes is a result of poverty and economic crises, hence, the Federal Government must make efforts to improve the state of the economy.\n\nPeople living with mental disorder need significant support and care from those around them, the support of family members, friends, peer groups, colleagues and even religious organizations will definitely go a long way in stemming the tide of depression and other high functioning mental disorders in the country.,\n\n-Adeyemo is of the Ministry of Information and Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja.",
          "summary": "\u201cMental disorder?\nAnother misconception among the general public is the belief that individuals with mental illness are dangerous to the society.\nMental illness is a general term for a group of illnesses that may impact on a person\u2019s thoughts, perceptions, feelings and behavior.\nHigh functioning mental illness is the term that has been adopted to describe those living with a mental illness that is almost undetectable.\nMore mental health professionals should be properly trained and empowered to provide specialized care for people with mental illness.",

Kennedy Airport as he prepared to fly to Nigeria by way of Amsterdam, federal authorities said.\n\nHe was charged after allegedly stealing over $350,000 in jobless benefits from the Washington state Employment Security Department in 2020.\n\nHe was also accused of trying to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of nearly $1.6 million, authorities said.\n\nA federal judge in New York in May ruled that Rufai could be released before trial on a $300,000 \u201csurety\u201d bond, but delayed the release to let federal prosecutors appeal.\n\nIn his decision Friday, Settle found that the \u201cdefendant poses a serious risk of nonappearance.\u201d\n\nTacoma attorney Lance Hester, one of Rufai\u2019s lawyers, said Rufai could ask the court to reconsider Friday\u2019s ruling if there were changes in his circumstances.\n\nFederal officials have called Rufai the first \u201csignificant\u201d arrest related to Washington\u2019s fraud.\n\nWashington state was severely victimized by fraudulent claims for pandemic-related benefits.\n\nIt likely paid out more than $647 million in such fraudulent claims, though $370 million was recovered, according to state officials.\n\nAnother lawyer for Rufai, Michael C.

          "text": "TB Joshua, the late general overseer of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations, has been accused of some outrageous claims.\n\nBisola Johnson, his former aide, claims that TB Joshua sexually assaulted her numerous times throughout their 14-year relationship.\n\nShe claimed that the well-known man of God has a s3kz ring that allowed him to have his way with young virgins whenever he pleased.\n\nFollowing the death of the Synagogue\u2019s general overseer, a slew of allegations and information ranging from good to terrible has been generated about him, but this new one surpasses them all.\n\nJoshua was a serial s*sexual abuser, according to Bisola, who spoke to Sinai Mountain Radio in the United States. She claimed that TB Joshua was particularly interested in having sex with virgins and young girls.\n\nBisola went on to say that she ended up working for the church after TB Joshua utilized her troubles to brainwash her into doing so when she went to the church for a spiritual encounter in her 20s.\n\nJoshua allegedly introduced Bisola to his hidden cult of young females with whom he sleeps whenever he feels like it, according to Bisola.\n\n\u201cIt was a service day, I didn\u2019t know he wanted to initiate me on that day. He asked for me and when I went, I didn\u2019t see him in the office that I used to know. I was ushered into his bedroom and he asked if I was afraid, I said no, I was fine. He then hugged me and said, I should go back to work,\u201d Bisola said.\n\n\u201cAfter 15 minutes, he called me again and this time, I saw him sitting with a white towel around his waist; I was standing at the door and he asked me to come in. I didn\u2019t want to go because I saw his towel had shifted and his manhood was showing. TB Joshua insisted, dragged me into his bedroom by force; that is when I knew it was intentional. He dragged my hand and placed it on his manhood and started rubbing it.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was struggling. I said even if such a thing will happen, it shouldn\u2019t be in the house of God. I was very scared for him and thinking God will take his power but not knowing that was the strength of his power,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like a pride there if TB Joshiua called you into his bedroom,\u201d She further alleged he impregnated numerous of those girls and they had to have abortions.\n\nBisola Johnson, who endured 14 years in that position before fleeing to create her own ministry, believes there are many other victims of Joshua\u2019s abuse who are frightened to speak up.\n\nWatch video below:",

          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",
          "summary": "BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians.\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarmsIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country.\nIt, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone.",

Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitization were able to allay the fears of members,\u2019\u2019 Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute the huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility, and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nThe CECPC Chairman told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair, and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organized recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring the relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nSome members of the APC who attended the meeting include, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, Progressives Governors Forum, and Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, and Chairman of Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong.

          "text": "More than a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died of Covid-19 in Indonesia, according to a medical association, as the Southeast Asian country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers and highly infectious new virus strains.\n\nInfections have surged in the nation of 270 million people in the past week, with more than 2.05 million cases reported as of Saturday, as hospital occupancy rates soared to more than 75 percent in Jakarta and other hard-hit areas.\n\nNearly 1,000 Indonesian health workers have died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country\u2019s medical association confirming on Friday that 401 doctors were among the victims \u2013 14 of whom were fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still updating the data and confirming whether the other cases had been vaccinated or not,\u201d the association\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation head Mohammad Adib Khumaidi told journalists.\n\nThe rise of severe cases in inoculated medical workers has raised questions about the China-produced Sinovac jab, which Indonesia is heavily relying on to vaccinate more than 180 million people by early next year.\n\nThis month, more than 300 vaccinated doctors and healthcare workers in Central Java were found to have been infected with COVID-19, with about a dozen hospitalised.\n\nThe country is also grappling with new virus strains, including the highly infectious Delta variant first identified in India.\n\nIn the capital, Jakarta, the surge in cases have forced hospitals to set up emergency tents, according to Detik news website, which quoted provincial government officials.\n\nIn Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province, Dr Inke Nadia D Lubis, member of the COVID task force in the area, reported that in the last six months as many as 1,800 children have been infected with the virus, including 14 who have died.\n\nMore than a third of the cases reported were elementary school-age students, while a quarter were high school-age students, Inke was quoted by Detik as saying.\n\nOn Friday, President Joko Widodo said that the country is facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d, vowing to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d while urging his countrymen to cooperate in the government\u2019s response.\n\nClinical symptoms suggest that strain is responsible for a surge in cases in West Java, the medical association\u2019s spokesperson for the province, Eka Mulyana, said.\n\n\u201cIn West Java, bed occupancy rates have exceeded 90 percent. Some hospitals\u2019 rates are even more than 100 percent,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, our health system is close to collapse.\u201d\n\nDozens of communities in Central Java\u2019s Kudus regency were put under lockdown after the Delta variant was detected in local testing samples, causing a sudden spike in virus cases.\n\nA patient rests on the floor at a temporary tent outside the emergency ward of a government hospital, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Bekasi, on the outskirts of Jakarta on Friday [Willy Kurniawan/Reuters]\n\nThe surge has been partly blamed on millions travelling from that region across the Muslim-majority nation at the end of Ramadan last month, despite an official ban on the annual migration.\n\nThe Indonesian medical association\u2019s Kudus representative, Ahmad Ipul Syaifuddin, has said the mass movement of people had made it next to impossible to determine where the surge began.\n\n\u201cWe have no clue on how to trace and find the first spreader of the Delta cases because the sampling test result came out around three weeks after the mass exodus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy sample was among the tested sampling for the Delta variant. I have already recovered and (have) tested negative now, but I still have a cough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Jakarta Post reported that among those who were recently infected with the coronavirus is an unnamed Indonesian official, who was travelling to Italy for an international conference.\n\nThe official is under quarantine for 10 days after testing positive upon arrival at the Sicilian port city of Catania, where officials from around the world were convening for a series of G20 ministerial meetings.",

          "text": "The widow of John McAfee, the British-American tycoon who died in a Spanish prison this week while awaiting extradition to the United States, on Friday demanded a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of his death, saying her husband did not appear suicidal when they last spoke.\n\nAuthorities in Spain are conducting an autopsy on McAfee\u2019s body but have said that everything at the scene in his cell indicated that the 75-year-old killed himself.\n\nAn official source familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that a suicide note had been found in McAfee\u2019s pocket. The source, who was not authorized to speak about an ongoing judicial inquiry, refused to comment on the content of the note.\n\nMcAfee\u2019s Spanish lawyer, Javier Villalba, said that the family had not been informed by authorities about the note.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur\u2019s death on Wednesday, McAfee\u2019s widow Janice McAfee said she wanted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d to provide \u201canswers about this was able to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis last words to me were \u2018I love you and I will call you in the evening,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old told reporters outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona where she recovered her late husband\u2019s belongings. She said they spoke earlier on the day he was found dead.\n\n\u201cThose words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn McAfee was arrested at the Barcelona airport in October last year on a warrant issued by prosecutors in Tennessee who were seeking up to three decades of imprisonment for allegedly evading more than $4 million in taxes.\n\nThe day before he was found dead, Spain\u2019s National Court had announced that it was agreeing to his extradition to the U.S. but the decision was not final.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,\u201d Janice McAfee told reporters. \u201cI blame the U.S. authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.\u201d\n\nThe National Court judge said John McAfee had provided no evidence to back his allegations that he was being politically persecuted. \u201cOn the contrary, according to his own testimony, he took part in primaries of a certain party to defend his convictions with a result little favorable to him,\u201d the judge wrote in the ruling seen by AP.\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, the U.S. State Department confirmed for the first time the tycoon\u2019s death, offering the family condolences. It said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring local authorities\u2019 investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate assistance to the family. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment.\u201d\n\nResults of McAfee\u2019s autopsy could take \u201cdays or weeks,\u201d authorities have said.\n\nThe couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee had several children from previous relationships, Janice McAfee said.\n\nThe entrepreneur had not been connected with the companies that took over the antivirus software he built after he sold his shares in the 1990s. That early success had made McAfee rich and followed him in his troubled biography.\n\nIn 2012, he was sought for questioning in connection with the murder of his neighbor in Belize, but was never charged with a crime. The controversy didn\u2019t stop him from making long-shot runs for the U.S. presidency starting in 2016.\n\nBut it was his more recent tax problems that kept him away from the U.S., the country where the British-born entrepreneur was raised and had built his early success.\n\nThe Tennessee prosecutors\u2019 indictments from 2020 showed that the tycoon allegedly failed to declare income made by promoting cryptocurrencies, attending speaking engagements and selling the rights for a documentary on his eventful life.\n\n\u201cEven though he was born in England, America was his home,\u201d Janice McAfee said. \u201cHe came there when he was a child. He had his first girlfriend there, his first case, you know, his first job. He made his first millions there and he wanted to be there. But, you know, politics just wouldn\u2019t allow for that to happen.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee\u2019s social media postings indicated that he had chosen a northeastern Spanish coastal resort town as his base in Europe at least since late 2019.\n\n\u201cAll John wanted to do was spend his remaining years fishing and drinking,\u201d his widow said on Friday. \u201cHe had hope that things would work out. We knew that there would be an uphill battle to continue to fight this situation. But he\u2019s a fighter \u2026 And anybody that knows John, that knows him even a little bit, knows that about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just so loving. He had a big heart and he just loved people and he just wanted to have peace in his life,\u201d Janice McAfee added. \u201cMy prayers are that his soul has found the peace in death that he could not find in life.\u201d",

          "text": "The Russian military has launched sweeping manoeuvres in the Mediterranean Sea featuring warplanes capable of carrying hypersonic missiles, a show of force amid a surge in tensions following an incident with a British destroyer in the Black Sea.\n\nMoscow said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of HMS Defender, a British ship, on Wednesday to force it out of an area near Crimea that Russia claims as its territorial waters. Britain denied that account, insisting its ship was not fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters.\n\nThe Russian drills that began on Friday in the Eastern Mediterranean come as a British carrier strike group is in the area.\n\nEarlier this week, British and US F-35 fighters from HMS Queen Elizabeth flew combat sorties against the ISIL (ISIS) group.\n\nRussia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, allowing President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government to reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said a pair of MiG-31 fighter jets capable of carrying Kinzhal hypersonic missiles arrived at the Russian airbase in Syria for the exercise. The Hemeimeem airbase, in the coastal province of Latakia, serves as the main hub for Moscow\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nIt is the first time the warplanes capable of carrying Kinzhal have been deployed beyond the Russian borders.\n\nThe military says the Kinzhal flies at 10 times the speed of sound and has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles).\n\nThe Defence Ministry said the manoeuvres in the Eastern Mediterranean involve several warships, two submarines and long-range Tu-22M3 bombers along with other combat aircraft.\n\nThe supersonic, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3s were first deployed to Syria last month in a demonstration of an increased Russian military foothold in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Russian military has modernised the runway at Hemeimeem to accommodate heavy bombers and built a second one to expand the operations there.\n\nRussia has also expanded and modified a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, the only such facility that it currently has outside the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe Russian military has increased the number and scope of its drills amid a bitter strain in relations with the West, which have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula.\n\nAs part of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s efforts to beef up the Russian military, the navy in recent years has revived the Soviet-era practice of constantly rotating its warships in the Mediterranean.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, Commodore Steve Moorhouse said the Eastern Mediterranean has become more \u201ccongested and contested\u201d with the heavier Russian military presence in Syria, resulting in regular encounters with Russian ships and warplanes.\n\nHe noted that a Russian warship has come within 16km (10 miles) of the carrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia warned Britain and the United States on Friday against \u201ctempting fate\u201d by sending warships to the Black Sea, and said it would defend its borders using all possible means including military force.\n\nIn a statement broadcast on state television, the Defence Ministry said it was ill-advised for British and US vessels to approach the coast of Crimea.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Pentagon and the British navy, which are sending their warships into the Black Sea, not to tempt fate in vain,\u201d said Major General Igor Konashenkov, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nHMS Defender was \u201cnot more than a target\u201d for the Black Sea fleet\u2019s defences, he said.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said separately that Washington and London were sowing strife by failing to accept Crimea was part of Russia, and that Russia was ready to defend its borders using all means, including military force.\n\nMoscow warned Britain on Thursday that it would bomb British naval vessels in the Black Sea if what it called provocative actions by the British navy were repeated off the Crimean coast.\n\nThe British embassy in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgian the South Caucasus, wrote on Twitter on Friday that HMS Defender was set to arrive in the port city of Batumi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea.",
