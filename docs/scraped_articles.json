          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nThe World Health Organisation has announced the launch of a new mobile application that would help curb skin cancer.\n\nThe application, according to the WHO, is to help protect individuals\u2019 from excessive ultraviolet exposure, a key cause of skin cancer and other ultraviolet-related diseases.\n\nThe WHO said the app will enable individuals to be aware of when to use sun protection, adding that it will help to lessen the burden of skin cancer and UV-related eye damage, globally.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the app is programmed to give localised information regarding radiation levels in UV and also, highlight time slots when protection from the sun is necessary.\n\nThe global health agency said the launch of the SunSmart Global UV app was done in collaboration with, the World Meteorological Organisation, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the International Labour Organisation.\n\nThe WHO director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, Dr. Maria Neira, said, \u201cEvidence shows that overexposure to UV is the major cause of skin cancer.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s vital for people to know when and how to protect ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe encourage everyone to use the application to protect themselves and their children, and to make this a daily habit.\u201d\n\nAlthough, the sun is necessary for everyone majorly for the production of Vitamin D because it assists to prevent the occurrence of bone diseases like rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis.\n\nThe WHO however said too much sun can be hazardous, and even life-threatening.\n\nAccording to the WHO, in 2020, more than 1.5 million skin cancer cases were diagnosed globally.\n\nThe global health agency added that over 120,000 individuals around the world also died from this very preventable disease.\n\nThe WHO noted saying, \u201cone of the main factors contributing to these cancers is excess UV radiation from thinning of the earth\u2019s stratospheric ozone layer resulting from the release of certain manmade chemicals.\n\n\u201cUnder the international treaty known as the Montreal Protocol, all United Nations Member States are phasing out the production and consumption of those substances according to a specific timetable.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these continuing efforts, the ozone level is projected to recover by mid-century. In the meantime, individuals need to be particularly cautious to protect themselves from receiving too much UV exposure \u2013 this is where the UV app plays an important awareness role,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of UNEP\u2019s Ozone Secretariat, Ms. Meg Seki, said, \u201cThe Montreal Protocol protects the stratospheric ozone layer which, in turn, protects human health and the environment by blocking most of the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cSkin cancer can result from overexposure to the sun, so everyone must remain vigilant and ensure they protect themselves adequately with hats and sunscreen.\n\n\u201cThe SunSmart app is a fantastic UV monitoring tool, and I would encourage everyone to use it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe global health agency said, \u201cThe UV App has been launched to coincide with the first day of summer in the northern hemisphere. By increasing the public\u2019s awareness and helping to reduce the incidence of skin cancer, this application ultimately supports the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and well-being worldwide by 2030.\u201d\n\nIn addition, \u201cMuch of UV-related illness and death can be avoided through a set of simple prevention measures such as limit time in the midday sun, seek shade when UV rays are most intense, wear protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen of sun protection.\n\n\u201cProtecting children from extended periods in the sun is particularly important as excessive sun exposure during these early years can significantly increase the risk of UV-related diseases later in life,\u201d it said.\n\nThe UN health agency added, \u201cThe SunSmart Global UV app is available free of charge at both the Apple App and Google Play stores.\n\n\u201cIt provides exposure, a major cause of skin cancer and other UV-related diseases.\n\n\u201cAlso, the app provides five-day UV and weather forecasts at searchable locations.\n\n\u201cThe app allows the inclusion of national and local data streams and adaptation to multiple languages \u2013 it is currently available in Chinese, English, French, German, Russian, Dutch, and Spanish.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

I know our opponents in other political parties that milked this country for 16 years are afraid of the achievements of president Muhammadu Buhari as well as the party in general,\u201d he said.\n\nChief Eneukwu also stated that, APC has a capable presidential Candidate in Senator Tinubu, who has the whirl withal to win election as his emergence has sent panic into the camp of the opposition.\n\nHe however congratulated the Party on her victory during the just concluded Gubernatorial election in Ekiti state ;where her candidate, Biodun Oyebanji emerged victoriously in a landslide margin, saying, it is a sign of greater things to come for the party.\n\n\u201cI also wish to state that, APC has the best candidate for the presidential election in the country. Since his Emergence, it has always been from one panic to another in the camp of the opposition political parties as his pedigree still remains the best and he has all it takes to win the 2023 general election and make Nigeria a better place\n\n\u201cI also congratulate all the party faithfuls, on our resounding victory in Saturday during the Gubernatorial elections in Ekiti State ;especially, the Governor elect, Biodun Oyebanjo\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a tip of the iceberg on what to expect during the 2023 general elections as Apc is the only party that has the interest of Nigerians.\u201d",

          "text": "Recently, kidnapping of clerics has worsened.\n\nBetween June 2021 and June 2022 in Nigeria, a handful of clerics have been abducted and killed while some regained freedom.\n\nEven church worshippers are not left out in all of these unfortunate incidents.\n\nThe continued abduction of clerics and their followers in parts of the country is now a cause of concern because of the violation of the biblical warnings in the holy book which says \u2018do my prophet no harm\u2019.\n\nWhile the frequency of ransom payment varies, many victims pay from 5 million naira to over 100 million naira.\n\nHere is a rundown of the killings, abductions:\n\nTerrorists on June 5 set off explosives at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State murdering innocent worshippers.\n\nA few days before the unfortunate Owo incident, suspected militants reportedly killed 32 Christians in an Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) parish in Kajuru, Kaduna State.\n\nGunmen also invaded the Christ the King Major Seminary, Kaduna, on October 9 2021, kidnapping five seminarians. All were eventually freed.\n\nOn May 29, the Prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria, His Eminence, Samuel Kanu, was kidnapped along with two other clergymen, the Methodist Bishop of Owerri, Rt Rev Okechukwu Michael and the prelate\u2019s chaplain, at the Umunneochi LGA, Abia State, along Enugu-Port Harcourt highway.\n\nOn May 25, two Catholic priests, Rev Father Stephen Ojapa and Rev Father Oliver Okpara, were kidnapped in Katsina when the brigands invaded St Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church, Gidan Maikambo, in Kafur LGA of Katsina State.\n\nRev Fr Alphonsus Uboh was seized from his station at St Pius X Parish, Ikot Abasi Akpan in Mkpat Enin LGA of Akwa Ibom on May 8. His kidnappers demanded N100 million ransom to free him.\n\nThree weeks before Fr Uboh\u2019s abduction, another clergyman, Pastor John Okoriko, was also kidnapped barely 10 kilometres away. Okoriko was the founder of Solid Rock Kingdom Church. His abductors also demanded N100 million to release him.\n\nOn May 22, an Anglican cleric, Venerable Olu Obanla and his son were abducted in Ose local government area of Ondo State. Their kidnappers called his relatives to demand N10 million ransom.\n\nThe month of March likewise saw a spate of kidnappings where clerics were soft targets.\n\nOn March 8, 2022, Rev Fr Joseph Akete Bako, parish priest of St John\u2019s Church, Kudenda, Kaduna, was kidnapped from his station in an attack in which one person was killed. Fr Bako later died after eight weeks in their custody.\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Rev Fr Felix Zakari Fidson, of the Diocese of Zaria, Kaduna State, was also abducted.\n\nThree days later, on March 27, 2022, another Catholic cleric, Rev Fr Leo Raphael Ozigi, parish priest of St Mary\u2019s Church, Sarkin Pawa Village in Munya LGA of Niger State, was kidnapped along with others. He regained his freedom after the gangsters were paid.\n\nIn April last year, gunmen kidnapped Rev Fr Izu Marcel Onyeocha of Mother Theresa of Kolkata Catholic Church. Owerri, Imo State along Enugu-Owerri highway.\n\nIn May 2021, St Vincent Ferrer Malumfasi Catholic Parish in Sokoto was attacked and two priests were abducted; one was killed and the other was released later.\n\nIn June 2021, a Catholic priest of Maiduguri Diocese, Fr Elija Juma Wada, was also kidnapped but he later managed to escape.\n\nIn January 2021, Fr Joseph Danjuma Shekari of Kafanchan diocese was kidnapped from his parish house, and later released.\n\nIn June 2021, the Anglican Bishop of Jebba Diocese, Kwara State, Rt. Rev. Oluwaseun Aderogba was kidnapped by gunmen alongside his wife, and driver on the Oyo-Ogbomoso Expressway, Oyo State. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of N70m.\n\nCatholic priests, the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Jos East, Rev. James Kantoma, and Fr. Christopher Onotu of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church, Kogi, were abducted between June 6 and June 13 this year.",

          "text": "Petrol subsidy removal was suspended because it was not in the country\u2019s best interest, President Muhammadu Buhari said yesterday.\n\nHe said while removing subsidy looks good on paper, the human consequences cannot be ignored.\n\nAlthough his administration was on the verge of removing petrol subsidy last year, President Buhari said it became inadvisable after input from industry experts and other economic factors.\n\nThe President spoke in an interview with Bloomberg. He fielded questions on a wide range of issues, including the economy, infrastructure development, activities of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and state of the nation.\n\nThe President pointed out that the West sustains its markets through fuel subsidies.\n\nAccording to him, issues around petrol subsidy would be resolved through ongoing efforts at boosting local refining, especially through private sector involvement.\n\nThe President said: \u201cMost western countries are today implementing fuel subsidies. Why would we remove ours now? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n\n\u201cWhat our western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things.\n\n\u201cMy government set in motion plans to remove the subsidy late last year.\n\n\u201cAfter further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cBoosting internal production for refined products shall also help.\n\n\u201cCapacity is due to step up markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries (Dangote Refinery, BUA Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery) come on board.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate is still susceptible to external shocks that can suddenly and severely affect Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cAs we step up domestic production \u2013 both in fuel (enabled by PIA) and food (agricultural policies) \u2013 the inflationary threat shall diminish, and we can move toward unification.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s presidential bid violated any law, President Buhari said the CBN\u2019s board had the responsibility to determine that.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the President. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s board of directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nThe President said he would endorse a candidate for president: \u201cYes. I will endorse the APC candidate for president.\u201d\n\nOn stoning to death people accused of blasphemy, he said no person has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\n\u201cChristianity and Islam, our two great faiths and their Great Books have far more in common than they have apart.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a long tradition of tolerance that we must draw on, and we must strive to find common ground.\n\n\u201cWhat comes out of this tragedy is to cherish what we share, while at the same time respect our differences,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why taxes cannot be increased, President Buhari said 80 per cent of those to be taxed are in the informal sector.\n\n\u201cThough we have the largest economy in Africa, it is true that translating that wealth into revenue generation is challenging.\n\n\u201cWe raised VAT in 2020, and the IMF wanted us to raise it further, but this is a complex issue that cannot be addressed by tax hikes alone.\n\n\u201cAround 80 per cent of Nigerians work in the so-called informal economy \u2013 a situation exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to tax the informally employed, and no country has yet found an adequate solution,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what the government was doing to ensure food security in the face of spiralling inflation, President Buhari accused the European Union (EU) of encouraging the export of their subsidised food into Africa and therefore undermining the continent\u2019s food sustainability efforts.\n\n\u201cThe EU\u2019s policies, in particular, are all rhetoric of open trade \u2013 yet their Common Agricultural Policy subsidy programmes and export of those subsidized goods create dependence, undermine Africa\u2019s self-sufficiency, and cause food poverty and starvation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said he had been able to secure the repatriation of looted funds because the nation\u2019s international partners could trust his leadership.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile, President Buhari, said a narrow focus on debt misses the point.\n\n\u201cWhat it fills is Nigeria\u2019s longstanding infrastructure deficit by constructing a foundation for sustainable growth \u2013 spreading opportunity to ensure no part of the country is left behind, which has led to insecurity in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure developments have been the most ambitious since independence.\n\n\u201cOver 800 federal roads are being constructed or undergoing rehabilitation and 650km of rail line have been laid, helping alleviate food inflation pressures, given most food is produced in the north.\n\n\u201cHad the infrastructure gap not been filled it will only grow, become more costly to repair what little we have while lacking more on infrastructure on which to build growth, negatively impacting progress towards UN Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said with the reforms in the oil, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will on July 1 become a Limited Liability Company and be subject to more robust auditing and commercial disclosure obligations.\n\nHe believes it will help stimulate investment and boost transparency, where corruption has deterred the former and stymied the latter.\n\nPresident Buhari pleaded with international partners, especially the United States and Britain, to remove the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) from the international financial network.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has reacted for the first time to Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele\u2019s presidential ambition, saying his fate would be determined by the apex bank\u2019s board of directors on whether his actions have fallen foul of the laws.\n\nClamour for Emefiele\u2019s resignation had mounted when news broke that N100 million presidential nomination and expression of interest form of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party had been procured for him.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nA Nigerian court sitting in Abuja had dismissed his request to not be prevented from contesting for the presidential ticket of any political party in the February 2023 elections.\n\nThe suit was seeking to restrain the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the country\u2019s attorney general from disqualifying him from pursuing his presidential ambition.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, asked if he he was concerned about the debate around the central bank\u2019s independence following Emefiele\u2019s interest in running for president, Buhari replied: \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s board of directors to determine whether the CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nThe President spokeon the performane of CBN Governor \u201cbut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again. Instead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn why his administration was not heeding the call by IMF, World Bank and many leading economists to remove the fuel subsidy and unify the exchange rate, Buhari said subsidy removal was becoming increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cMost western countries are today implementing fuel subsidies. Why would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander. What our western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things. My government set in motion plans to remove the subsidy late last year. After further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cBoosting internal production for refined products shall also helps. Capacity is due to step up markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries (Dangote Refinery, BUA Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery) come on board.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate is still susceptible to external shocks that can suddenly and severely affect Nigerian citizens. As we step up domestic production \u2013 both in fuel (enabled by PIA) and food (agricultural policies) \u2013 the inflationary threat shall diminish, and we can move toward unification.\u201d\n\nWhy western allies must tag IPOB terror group\n\nPresident Buhari also gave reason why Western allies must designate the Indigenous People\u2019s of Biafra (IPOB) as terror group.\n\nIn his written responses to questions posed by Bloomberg News, he said: \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today, they are close to extinction as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Airforce airstrike in March. The jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations and stand as testament to renewed trust re-built between Nigeria and our traditional western allies under my government.\n\n\u201cWe urge those same international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing another group \u2013 IPOB \u2013 as a terrorist organisation. Their leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop.\n\n\u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes. Governors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on Bola Tinubu being his preferred successor. Asked if he plan to endorse a candidate for president? If so, who? He replied: \u201cYes. I will endorse the APC candidate for president.\u201d\n\nAsked if he was concerned that people accused of blasphemy still get stoned to death on the streets in northern Nigeria, Buhari said: \u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands. Christianity and Islam, our two great faiths and their great books have far more in common than they have apart. Nigeria has a long tradition of tolerance that we must draw on, and we must strive to find common ground. \u201cWhat comes out of this tragedy is to cherish what we share, while at the same time respect our differences.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022Queues to disappear in few days, NNPC assures\n\n\u2022Depot owners lament, say N165 per litre unsustainable\n\n\u2022House summons national oil company, downstream regulatory authority, marketers over fuel scarcity, soaring diesel, gas prices\n\nPeter Uzoho and Gilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nDespite the position of some oil marketers that the current pump price for petrol in the country was unsustainable following long queues that have surfaced in some cities across the country, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) yesterday maintained that the pump price for premium motor spirit (PMS) remains at N165 per litre.\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday assured Nigerians that it has over two billion litres of PMS that would last for the next 34 days in the country, adding that there was enough stock to meet the nation\u2019s demand.\n\nHowever, oil marketers under the aegis of Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) have empathised with their customers and the members of the public on the current distribution hiccups witnessed in the supply of petrol from the various petrol stations dispensing at N165 per litre, saying the price was unsustainable.\n\nBut the House of Representatives has summoned stakeholders in the Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector to appear before it today over the resurgence of petrol scarcity and queues in some parts of the country as well as the soaring prices of diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nThe statement by the NMDPRA that insisted on N165 per litre for pump price, came on the heels of the recent agitation by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) that PMS sold at N165 was no longer sustainable.\n\nThe Executive Director, Distribution Systems, Storage and Retailing Infrastructure, NMDPRA, Mr. Ogbugo Kalu, who spoke at a media briefing said the Authority was ever ready to enforce the price on independent marketers who are planning to increase pump price to N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cPMS is a regulated product. The price is fixed and the ex-depot price is known. The pump price remains at N165. So we continue to urge Nigerians to keep within these operating rules,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, in the next three days, the Authority would focus its energy in making sure that the marine stock would be translated into inland stock to get petroleum products across the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cWithin a very short while, we will see the fuel queues pale out. So that is what our focus in the Authority and for the next few days we urge every operator and indeed even assure the public that whatever glitches and supply gaps that have been observed will disappear shortly.\n\n\u201cSo we do not encourage any panic buying. We urge Nigerians to be calm as these things will be resolved very easily.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Executive Director, NNPC, Adeyemi Adetunji, said over two billion litres of PMS that would last for the next 34 days was in country, adding that there was enough stock to meet the nation\u2019s demand. He assured that NNPC was working with the entire operators and stakeholders in the downstream sector to ensure that petroleum products get to distribution channels and filling stations across the country.\n\n\u201cWith all the apparatuses put in place, we can assure that all the fuel queues will disappear in the next few days. Nigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Petroleum Pipeline Marketing Company (PPMC), Isiaku Abdullahi, said all hands were on the deck to support its marketers and transporters to ensure that petroleum products get to where they are needed.\n\nHe said there were about three vessels in the Apapa jetty waiting to offload more than 60 million metric tonnes, adding that in due course, the potential and imagined fuel crisis in Lagos would be over.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director, NIPCO Plc, Suresh Kumar, said his company was receiving 18 million litres of the 90,000 metric tonnes waiting to be offloaded at the Apapa jetty.\n\n\u201cI am happy to announce that we have another 32 million to be received from the vessels which are coming. So, with that in picture, you know, the supply gap or the supply logistic challenges which was there has been addressed.\n\n\u201cSo, the products are there with us, we can see that the trucks have started coming up. The Authority has given us the first approval to see that these products of about 30 to 40 million litres should be dispensed on a 24-hour basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, what I can categorically assure all Nigerians is that the product is there and it is going to flow into the trucks and they are going to move from here to the stations. So, they have to be rest assured they should not panic, panic is a problem, it will create high demand.\n\n\u201cSo without panic and if this normal situation functions, then everybody should be getting product in the next couple of days,\u201d he averred.\n\nDepot Owners Lament Unsustainable N165 Per Litre Petrol Pump Price\n\nHowever, DAPPMAN, in a statement issued last night, said the on-going Russian/Ukraine War had adversely affected the whole world, including the downstream oil and gas sector in Nigeria, impacting negatively on global and local fuel and food supply.\n\nIt said the international prices of these items had risen astronomically and had more than doubled their old rates since the beginning of the war, thereby causing extreme increases in local prices.\n\nBy extension, DAPPMAN said the local running costs of operating their various fuel depots had gone up astronomically, adding that the petrol they supply was sourced, solely from Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited\u2019s marketing subsidiary, Petroleum Products Marketing Company Limited (PPMC) for sale to the public at the regulated price of N165 per litre. It explained that this purchase was made by depot operators with funds sourced with high bank interest charges, alongside increased costs of hiring vessels, with which they deliver the fuel cargoes to their depots.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThese costs have doubled within the period of this Russian/Ukraine war.\n\nAdded to this is the scarcity of bunkers (ship\u2019s fuel). We also experienced astronomical increases in the cost of diesel used to power equipment and machinery in our various depots and our retail outlets.\n\n\u201cDepot Owners and the government have continued to struggle over time to sustain supply of PMS at the current pump price of N165 per litre despite the huge subsidy cost to government and abysmal margins to the Depot owners.\u201d\n\nThe marketers\u2019 association observed that if not for its suspension, the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 would have provided an ideal enabling environment by creating the free market in which demand and supply would affect fuel pump price.\n\n\u201cWe hereby assure the public that Depot Owners, working in concert with NNPC Limited, through its marketing subsidiary, will continue to work hard to ensure availability of products nationwide,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHouse Summons NNPC, NMDPRA, Marketers over Fuel Scarcity, Soaring Diesel, Gas Prices\n\nThe House of Representatives has summoned stakeholders in the Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector to appear before it today over the resurgence of petrol scarcity and queues in some parts of the country and the galloping rise in the prices of diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nThe lawmakers in a letter signed by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) Hon. Mahmud Gaya, invited the heads of the stakeholder organisations and institutions in the Nigerian downstream petroleum sector.\n\nThose invited, in the letter seen by THISDAY, yesterday, included the Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) and that of the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC), two subsidiaries of NNPC Limited.\n\nOthers were the Chairman of the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAM), President of IPMAN and Chairman of DAPPMAN.\n\n\u201cYour various Memoranda should be forwarded to the Committee\u2019s secretariat in 60 print copies and a soft copy at the House of Representatives Complex on or before Wednesday 22 June, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward to receiving you, please accept the warmest assurances of the Joint Committee\u2019s highest esteem.\u201d, the concluding page of the letter read.\n\nFor the past few months, Nigerians have been going through difficulties to get petrol, diesel and cooking gas due to the scarcity and astronomical increase in the prices of the products, which are all imported.\n\nThe hike in the prices of the petroleum products, just like other commodities, has been blamed on the ongoing oil price rally, exacerbated by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the resultant trade sanctions against Russia, a major global supplier of refined petroleum products.\n\nA litre of diesel in Nigerian is currently selling for above N800 while a 12.5 kilogram of cooking gas is being sold for over N10,000 in some locations. This has pushed many users of the two products into using alternative sources like petrol generators, solar, inverters, firewood and charcoal.\n\nHowever, petrol that is still selling cheaper despite the global hike in prices, owing to the huge subsidy the country is spending to keep the pump price at N165 per litre, far less than the actual landing cost, is now becoming scarce and unavailable in some states including Lagos, Oyo, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe Chairman of IPMAN, Lagos Satellite Depot, Mr. Akin Akinrinade, had lamented the shortage of petrol in their depot, stated that since December 2021, not a litre of petrol had been lifted at the NNPC satellite depots at Ejigbo.\n\nThis, he noted, had left independent marketers at the mercy of private depots, whom he accused of hiking their ex- depot prices to a level no longer sustainable to sell petrol at N165.\n\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The statement by the NMDPRA that insisted on N165 per litre for pump price, came on the heels of the recent agitation by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) that PMS sold at N165 was no longer sustainable.\nThe Executive Director, Distribution Systems, Storage and Retailing Infrastructure, NMDPRA, Mr. Ogbugo Kalu, who spoke at a media briefing said the Authority was ever ready to enforce the price on independent marketers who are planning to increase pump price to N180 per litre.\nThe pump price remains at N165.\nNigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.",

          "text": "\u2022Insists subsidy removal good on paper, but has huge human consequences\n\n\u2022Reveals N152bn, $386m, \u00a31.1m, \u20ac157,000, others recovered in 2021\n\n\u2022Alleges IPOB lobbying US Congress with millions of dollars, must be declared terrorists\n\n\u2022Declares EU\u2019s trade policies rigged against Nigeria, other African countries\n\n\u2022On blasphemy, president insists no one has right to break the law\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, defended the policies being implemented by Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, saying rather than follow textbook solutions developed in the more advanced climes, which may not be suitable for Nigeria, the apex bank\u2019s head has rightly resorted to \u201cunorthodox\u201d measures in trying to resolve the country\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nIn his written responses to Bloomberg\u2019s interview questions, Buhari said the accusations against Emefiele by detractors, including being labelled as \u201cpolitical\u201d, had more to do with the methods he was deploying to try to revamp the Nigerian economy, rather than the substance of the allegations.\n\nThe president maintained that every country should have the right to choose its economic model and policies, insisting that the CBN chief is facing criticisms because he is not following traditional methods, which have failed in the past.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cBut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again.\n\n\u201cInstead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the independence of the office of the CBN governor, given Emefiele\u2019s alleged interest in the just-concluded presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president said if there were infractions, the board of the apex bank was better placed to sanction the governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s Board of Directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nA critical actor in the federal government\u2019s efforts to boost local food production, the CBN has provided loans to farmers and restricted access to foreign exchange for importers of dozens of products, actions for which it has received flaks.\n\nBut Buhari insisted that food price inflation in the country could have been worse if Emefiele had not initiated organised programmes to boost domestic production, stressing that even at that , Nigeria still does not grow enough domestically.\n\nHe pointed out that initiatives, such as the Anchor Borrower\u2019s Programme, boosted rice production to nine million metric tonnes in 2021, from around 5.4 million metric tonnes in 2015.\n\n\u201cEven in the years of drought, rice production outstripped pre-2015 levels. Imports have fallen to near zero. We are making progress,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn why he had continued to retain subsidy on petrol, the president noted that even most Western countries were currently implementing fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhy would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, while the removal of subsidy may look good on paper, the impact on Nigerians would be largely negative and unbearable.\n\n\u201cWhat our Western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things,\u201d the president maintained.\n\nBuhari added that while his government had put in motion plans to remove fuel subsidy late last year, after further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\nWhile internal production for refined products would help mitigate the effect of subsidy removal, the president projected that capacity would increase markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries come on board.\n\nBuhari posited that he was winning the war against corruption, starting with the Whistleblowing Policy enacted in his first year in office, revealing that hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned within Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the monies had now been deployed as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the COVID-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rail, and power.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more than N152 billion has been recovered. Dollar recoveries for the year amount to over $386 million; GBP more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million, some more in digital and other currencies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Buhari had said international partners refused to return funds they held for decades to previous Nigerian administrations in the certainty they would simply be re-stolen.\n\n\u201cThey changed their approach with us because they knew my administration could be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said that his successor would inherit a far more resilient economy, thanks to investments in infrastructure and policies that he said had bolstered local production.\n\nOn security, the president reiterated that the military had recovered all territories previously held by Boko Haram, repeating his often-held position that terrorists no longer hold any territory in Nigeria while their leaders are now deceased.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Air Force airstrike in March.\u201d\n\nHe stated that jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations. He said these stood as testament to new trust re-built between Nigeria and its Western allies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader urged its international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and designating them as a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes.\n\n\u201cGovernors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe further opined that international trade remained rigged against food security in Africa, explaining that while the European Union\u2019s policies are all rhetoric of open trade, their common agricultural policy undermines Africa\u2019s self-sufficiency and grows poverty.\n\nOn the rising spate of religion-related killings, especially regarding the question of alleged blasphemy, the president declared that no one has any right to break the law and urged Christians and Muslims to respect each other\u2019s differences.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Red chamber gets new minority leader, whip\n\n\u2022House steps down motion to override Buhari\u2019s veto on statutory delegates\n\n\u2022APC loses three more senators to opposition parties\n\nSunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has asked the Senate to confirm the appointment of seven new ministerial nominees. The request was contained in a letter, which was read during plenary yesterday.\n\nThe new nominations came as the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the red chamber appointed Senators Phillip Aduda (FCT) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) as the new Minority Leader and Minority Whip, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, three senators from APC resigned their membership of the ruling party and joined the opposition. They are Senators Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina North), Lawal Yahaya Gumau (Bauchi South), and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North). While Kaita and Alimikhena defected to the opposition PDP, Gumau defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nIn another development, the House of Representatives, yesterday, stepped down a motion seeking to override Buhari for failing to assent to Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe ministerial nominees whose names were sent to the senate for confirmation included Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh \u2013 Abia State; Umana Okon Umana \u2013 Akwa Ibom State; Ekumankama Joseph Nkama \u2013 Ebonyi State; and Goodluck Nana Opiah \u2013 Imo State.\n\nOthers were Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub \u2013 Kano State; Ademola Adewole Adegoroye \u2013 Ondo State; and Odum Odi \u2013 Rivers State.\n\nThey would replace ministers, who resigned their appointments in the wake of the APC presidential primary election recently.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan read Buhari\u2019s letter requesting confirmation of the nominees on the floor of the Senate during plenary.\n\nBuhari state in the letter that the confirmation request was in accordance with the provisions of Section 147 subsection 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended.\n\nMeanwhile the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the red chamber has appointed Senators Phillip Aduda (FCT) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) as the new Minority Leader and Minority Whip respectively.\n\nLawan read the letter from PDP on the choice of new Minority Leader and Minority Whip at the start of plenary. National Secretary of PDP, Senator Samuel Anyawu, signed the letter.\n\nAduda\u2019s nomination was sequel to the resignation of the former Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe. Abaribe announced his defection from PDP to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) last week.\n\nPDP, in its letter to the senate president, explained that Utazi\u2019s nomination as new Minority Whip was as a result of the elevation of Aduda to the position of Minority Leader.\n\nHouse Steps Down Motion to Override Buhari\u2019s Veto on Statutory Delegates\n\nThe House of Representatives stepped down a motion seeking to override Buhari for failing to assent to Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe move to override the president\u2019s veto followed the failure of majority of lawmakers currently serving in the Senate and House of Representatives to secure their return tickets at the party primaries held last month. The mass failure was blamed on the ad hoc delegate system of candidates\u2019 selection.\n\nTwo members of PDP, Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, and Hon. Ben Igbakpa, who were among those that failed to get tickets to seek re-election, had protested on the floor of the House last Wednesday.\n\nThe National Assembly passed and transmitted the proposed legislation to the president about 30 days ago, the window within which the legislature could veto the president\u2019s decline of assent to the bill.\n\nIgbakpa, who represents Ethiope Federal Constituency of Delta State, had at the plenary last week raised a constitutional point of order, citing Section 58 (8) of the 1999 Constitution, which empowers the National Assembly to enact laws and also override the president with two0third majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nSpeaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, who affirmed that Mr. President was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\nPresenting the motion, titled, \u201cNeed to Invoke Section 58(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, to Pass Again the Electoral Act, 2022,\u201d at plenary, Igbakpa noted that the time frame for the president to assent or decline assent to the bill elapsed since June 11.\n\nHe lamented that the inability of the president to perform his constitutional duty was an affront on Section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, which empowered the National Assembly to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the federation or any part thereof.\n\nIgbakpa said the continued inaction of the president in either assenting or vetoing the bill had left a lacuna in Nigeria\u2019s constitutional democracy, which portended danger for the 2023 electoral process and other subsequent staggered elections of some states. This left the congresses of political parties in the hands of ad-hoc delegates to the detriment of statutory delegates.\n\nThe lawmaker prayed his colleague to invoke Section 58(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) with respect to the bill and communicate the position of the House of Representatives to the senate for concurrence.\n\nHowever, after presenting the motion, Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, who presided over the session, said according to the House rules, a motion could not be used to override a bill, hence the lawmaker should step down the motion and liaise with the chairman, Rules and Business, Hon. Hassan Fulata, to do the needful.\n\nReacting, Igbakpa reminded the deputy speaker that the speaker, Gbajabiamila, was the one who directed him last week to bring the matter in form of a motion.\n\nSpeaking, also, on the matter, Chairman, House Committee on Navy, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi (APC, Plateau), said if the motion mover would be able to instigate the National Assembly to have the required 240 members that would vote yes to override the president on that law and if the intention of overriding him was to address that lacuna then he would support it.\n\nAPC Loses Three More Senators to Opposition Parties\n\nThree APC senators resigned their membership of the ruling party. Senators Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina North), and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) defected to PDP, while Lawal Yahaya Gumau (Bauchi South), joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nThe notice of their resignation and defection was contained in three separate letters read during plenary by Lawan yesterday.\n\nKaita\u2019s letter read in part, \u201cAs senator representing Katsina North Senatorial District, I write to formally notify you of my resignation from the APC, and registration declaration for the PDP.\n\n\u201cMy resignation from the APC was born out of the marginalisation of critical stakeholders by the state government and leadership of the party in Katsina State, where small people like me do not have a chance.\n\n\u201cI have since been joyful and graciously accepted into the fold of the PDP in Katsina State.\u201d\n\nAlimikhena, on the other hand, explained that his decision to resign from APC was the result of \u201ccontinuing and multifaceted crisis that has bedevilled the APC\u201d, especially in his senatorial district. \u201cThat has created parallel executives that has undermined internal discipline, cohesion and focus,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defection of the three lawmakers reduced the total number of APC senators from 64 to 62 in the upper chamber, while PDP has risen from 39 to 41. Also, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) now has two, Young Progressive Party (YPP), one, and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) one.\n\nThe remaining two seats are vacant due to the positions of National Chairman and Deputy National Chairman of APC now occupied by Senators Adamu Abdullahi (Nasarawa West) and Abubakar Kyari (Borno North).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He recently took things to another level of contract inflation and squandering of the resources of the tribunal at the detriment of the smooth operations of the agency and its workers. The level of corruption is mind-boggling,\u201d the worker told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWith the backing of (the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice) Abubakar Malami, he has turned the tribunal to his personal estate. We no more go for training. He has a bed in his office and now brings different women to spend the night with him.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the National Assembly members should help us, this is a man who has no respect for any workers, what he did to a security man at a popular plaza in Abuja is small to what he does to workers here.\n\n\u201cAnytime the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission wants to investigate him, the AGF Malami would ask them not to; more so, some whistleblowers were recently sacked over Umar\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\nAnother worker said, \u201cThe situation has gone so bad to the extent that he now brings women to the office to sleep with. This is because he can no longer afford hotel bills as he is highly indebted to most hotels in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe suffering is too much. A visit to the Tribunal premises will speak volume from the exterior to the interior part of the building.\u201d\n\nOn March 29, 2021, Umar came into the limelight in recent times when he publicly assaulted one Clement Sargwak, a security guard at Banex Plaza in Wuse 2, Abuja.\n\nIn a five-minute viral video clip, he was seen slapping and kicking the security guard after an altercation ensued between them over a parking space on the premises of the plaza.\n\nThe victim, bruised on the lip he was attacked by Umar after he approached him for parking wrongly.\n\nHe subsequently went to court to challenge the powers of the Senate to investigate him in an alleged assault against the security guard.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Healthtracka, a Nigerian startup that offers convenient at-home lab tests, has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, according to a statement shared with TechCabal today. This round is led by venture capital investors Ingressive Capital and Hustle Fund, with participation from angel investors: Alunmi Angels Alliance and Flying Doctors.\n\nThis round of funding is coming after Healthtracka participated in the Techstars Toronto accelerator programme between October 2021 and January 2022.\n\nFounded in May 2021 by Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson and Victor Amusan in Lagos, Healthtracka allows users to book tests on its website, have their samples collected at their homes and access their results on their email addresses. Healthtracka partners with medical laboratories\u20143 at the moment: vCare Diagnostics, Lancet Laboratories, and Afriglobal Medicare\u2014who provide them with phlebotomists who go down to patients\u2019 houses to collect samples, analyse the samples and return results in 2 days.\n\nWhile Dare-Johnson\u2019s background in biochemistry and working at a lab before meant she knew the importance of regular medical diagnostics, she didn\u2019t think of creating a diagnostic solution until her fit and healthy-looking father suddenly slumped and was fighting for his life. This prompted her to delve deeper into Africa\u2019s healthcare system, and she discovered that there are a lot of undiagnosed Africans living with unknown pre-existing conditions. This is exacerbated by a weak healthcare system battling an infrastructure deficit and shortage of medical workers, all of which make accessing healthcare a hassle on the continent.\n\nAnother inspiration for Healthtracka was Dare-Johnson\u2019s role as a marketing lead at SynLab, a multinational medical diagnostic, which made her realise that providing medical tests in a seamless and accessible manner is important for better healthcare outcomes. This is because doctor consultations, even virtual ones, end with patients being required to take a lab test at a hospital. These tests are important because they make up 70% of the clinical decision making process. But this diagnostics requirement turns out to be a problem. Upon consultation, because of inconvenience, many patients are reluctant to leave their homes and make a trip to the hospital to take these important tests.\n\nDare-Johnson\u2019s co-founder, Amusan, comes from a family of medical doctors who have firsthand experience of the negative effects of late diagnoses, and that has shaped how Healthtracka approach this late diagnoses problem.\n\nDare-Johnson said that telemedicine platforms would previously offer only consultation services while referring patients to the hospital for diagnostics. Now they can now order lab tests for the patient using Healthtracka\u2019s API.\n\nUsers can go on Healthtracka\u2019s website and book lab tests ranging from fertility and STD tests to full blood count and COVID tests. Healthtracka also offers specialist consultation after patients have received their results.\n\nDare-Johnson explained that the pandemic was crucial to Healthtracka\u2019s growth, during the pandemic, Healthtracka started offering COVID-19 tests. \u201cIt was a trying time where people needed the comfort and the assurance that they could access healthcare remotely and safely,\u201d she told TechCabal.\n\nHealthtracka co-founder Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson\n\nDare-Johnson also said that privacy is one of the reasons its users patronise them as they shield clients from the societal stigma that comes with going to the hospital for tests such as the ones for sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\n\nHealthtracka currently has 50 different medical tests, which it has offered 7,000 times to 5,000 users at home, using a network of 700 phlebotomists, across 7 Nigerian cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Benin, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIfeoluwa is hungry and very bright. Not only did we anonymously use Healthtracka\u2019s services in diligence and had a 10/10 experience, we recognised truly what this could become across the continent, even from just interacting with her team for tests,\u201d Ingressive Capital\u2019s founder, Maya Horgan Famodu, said in a statement. \u201cThe product is high-quality, on time, affordable, and unlocking the door for a healthier Africa.\u201d\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s funding will also power its growth plans, which include introducing new product features and expanding its at-home lab testing services into Kenya and Ghana in the coming months. It also wants to expand its offering by launching an API that will allow both telemedicine services and traditional healthcare providers to offer at-home lab testing.\n\n\u201cWe have realised, especially in the countries we are expanding to, that the infrastructure deficit problem is the same. Our experience in offering diagnostics in Nigeria gives us confidence that we can tackle this problem in other markets as well,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cWe are reshaping culture to make lab testing as seamless as ordering a dress online. I think that we are able to scale this across Africa, especially in the places that need it the most.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Amazon Prime Video's first Nollywood film production deal",
          "text": "On Tuesday, Nollywood production house, Nemsia Films, announced that it closed an exclusive slate deal for 3 commissioned feature films with American streaming giant, Amazon Prime Video, which made its foray into Nollywood in December last year.\n\nIn theory, a slate deal in filmmaking is when one party (in this case, Amazon Prime Video) has agreed to either co-finance or solely finance multiple films of a particular film studio (in this case, Nemsia Films). In practice, Amazon is reserving the IP rights of the 3 films on the slate deal, and will cover their production costs. They would likely be called Amazon originals.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to collaborate with Nemsia Films on this pioneering slate deal, which will complement our growing lineup of local Nollywood content for Prime Video customers,\u201d Ayanna Lonian, Director of Content Acquisition and Head of Worldwide Major Studio Licensing Strategy at Prime Video, said in a statement sent to TechCabal. \u201cThis slate deal supports our goal to showcase Nollywood at its best, by telling authentic home-grown stories in a range of genres to Prime Video customers around the world.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNemsia was originally founded in 2009 as an advertising agency by Derin Adeyokunnu (Managing Partner) and BB Sasore (Creative Director). But after creating a couple of TV commercials, the founders realised they could do great work in feature filmmaking. So in 2013, they added that to their suite of offerings. Nemsia\u2019s first production, Before 30, a television drama series, was produced in 2014 and started airing on Africa Magic in 2015 before getting listed on Netflix in 2020.\n\nGod Calling (2018) produced by Nemsia\n\nThe company has gone on to produce more films including God Calling (2018) and Journey of an African Colony (2019), a docuseries based on books by lawyer and author, Olasupo Shasore. According to Adeyokunnu and Sasore, these titles, available on Netflix, have all become Netflix most viewed at some point.\n\n\u201cAt Nemsia Films, it is our belief in \u2018no gravity for the mind\u2019 that has led us to work with Prime Video, one of the leading streaming services worldwide, capable of delivering our stories further than we ever imagined,\u201d said Adeyokunnu said in a statement sent to TechCabal. \u201cWe are tremendously excited about the collaboration and what the future holds for Nollywood.\u201d\n\nEverybody is welcome\n\nAccording to Adeyokunnu, the journey to this slate deal started last year in June when Amazon Prime Video reached out to Sasore on LinkedIn for possible collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe shared what we\u2019ve got, and they loved it. After giving our work some light touch and creative guidance, they were good to go,\u201d Adeyokunnu told TechCabal\n\nSasore, who\u2019s the writer and director of most of the company\u2019s production, thinks Amazon is doing something right, which is leaving room for more emerging operators to play. \u201cThey\u2019re really keen on the story and are ready to source from the best guys, regardless of their status,\u201d he told TechCabal over a call.\n\nWhen entering a new market, it\u2019s usual practice for big platforms to reach out to already-established contacts in the industries of interest for business. So it\u2019s quite commendable when a big platform is keen on also reaching out to independent and emerging creators, like Amazon is currently doing.\n\nSasore thinks Amazon is different, and he has good reason to think so. Besides the fact that the streaming giant, with over 200 million global viewers, reached out to him on LinkedIn, it gave Nemsia the freedom to recommend more interesting production outfits.\n\n\u201cWe gave them some names, but they trusted us to make a choice, so we went for Loup Garou Films,\u201d said Sasore. Amazon loved the recommendation and folded them into the deal. Loup Garou is a small production company focused mostly on music video production. The company has shot videos for artists like Ladipoe and Ayra Starr.\n\nGod Calling (2018) produced by Nemsia\n\nThe deal Amazon signed with Nemsia was originally for 2 films, but now that Loup Garou is involved, Amazon has made room for 1 more film. This means, Loup Garou will be producing their own film independently but under Nemsia Films.\n\nThe first feature film from this deal will be Breath of Life, written and directed by Sasore and produced by actor Eku Edewor, who recently joined Nemsia as producer.\n\nSasore said the slated film will not be a production featuring an amalgamation of stars. \u201cThe story speaks for itself. It requires top talents and not necessarily the established stars,\u201d he said while talking about how they are casting for the slated films.\n\nMore skin in the game\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that Amazon Prime Video is not only keen on entering the second biggest film industry in the world, Nollywood, but wants to build a formidable local content bank. The streaming platform has already begun to follow the textbook strategy of capturing both local and diaspora audiences of any frontier market: getting in bed with the locals through licensing agreements.\n\nLast year when it announced its entry into Nollywood, it went into a licensing partnership with Inkblot Productions, a Nigerian film production company, to stream most of its titles that have already aired in cinemas. It also went into a similar partnership with Anthill Studios, an animation production company.\n\nLicensing agreements can be considered low-hanging fruits since they mostly require buying the rights to display already-made products\u2014films, in this case. But, through this deal, Amazon is demonstrating that it wants to put its back to work and have more skin in the game as it will be financing local films from scratch.\n\nSasore said even though the deal is signed and delivered and casting for the first film concluded, production will start in July and stretch through the third and fourth quarters of the year. He also said that Breath of Life should hit the screen by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThe streaming wars keep getting interesting. Netflix set up its Nigerian office. Since then, the streaming giant\u2019s offerings have enjoyed a mixed run with the Nigerian audience. YouTube, on its end, is serving as an outlet for indie filmmakers to distribute their work. Would Amazon Prime Video\u2019s entry into Nigeria intensify the competition, and would it dominate the market?\n\nSasore agreed that the competition will be more intense, which he says is good for the market. But he believes the road to dominance for any platform is still far. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market and, interestingly, an open one. There\u2019s no market leader yet, so there\u2019s still room to play. We are still in the early days of our greatness, and anybody in the film industry ecosystem right now is contributing to the groundwork.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

That is when I began my journey for freedom.\n\n\u201cI left Sabil Huda, popularly known as the camp of Abubakar Shekau and proceeded towards Njimiya and Parisu, where I met some of the Mujahedeens. They asked where I was going to and I told them I was given permission to visit my sister in Ngoshe.\n\n\u201cI finally arrived Gava village in Gwoza, after walking for many hours through the deadly forest under hardship condition. I asked some people to direct me to the home of daughter of Chibok.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting her, I told her of my plans to return home, she told me she had wanted to come with me but her husband has placed her on strict surveillance for attempting to run. I then left her and proceeded toward Ngoshe town.\n\n\u201cOn my way, I met an old man who promised to help me to escape. But he told me that it won\u2019t be possible in the afternoon untill the sun had set. At about 8:00 p.m., he took me to Ngoshe town and told me to pass the night in the outskirt of the town and proceed the next morning.\n\n\u201cWhen the day broke, I took myself to some soldiers where I was rescued with my baby,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her part, Hauwa Joseph said she was forcefully married to Amir Abbah, Commander of Boko Haram (Munzul), at Gazuwa camp who was later killed during an encounter with the troops of the Nigerian Army.\n\nShe said that she voluntarily escaped from the terrorists during massive incursion of the troops of the Nigerian army into their camp in Gazuwa on June 12.\n\nJoseph said as people were running the same direction where the sect members are hiding women and Children, she took a seperate route to escape from the terrorists camp.\n\nShe said on her way, she met with some of the insurgents who asked her where she was going, but she tricked them and told them that she was following some women to hide in the nearby forest.\n\n\u201cI slept under the tree with my child, then proceeded the next day untill I arrived the road where I approached a military check point. Initially, they thought I was a suicide bomber, but when I explained my self, they took me along with them.\n\nShe thanked the military for rescuing her, saying that she hoped other girls still in the camps of the terrorists would be rescued.\n\nMaj.-Gen. Christopher Musa, The Theartre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) North East Joint Operation, said that both girls were among the list of the missing Chibok girls.\n\nMusa said that the girls were rescued due to a massive military operation in Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountain, and the Lake Chad area.\n\n\u201cWe are putting more efforts to ensure that the rest of the girls are rescued through the ongiong Operation Lake and Desert Sanity,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Maj.-Gen. Waidi Shuaibu, General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division, Nigerian Army, said the girls were rescued between June 12 and 14, around Bama and Gwoza general area.\n\nShuaibu said the girls had received necessary medical attention and would be handed over to the appropriate authorities shortly.\n\nBoko Haram kidnapped 276 female students, aged between 16 and 18 from the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State in April 2014.\n\nOver 100 of the girls were still missing as at April 14, 2021, seven years after the initial kidnapping.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

It is a hypocrisy that must end.\n\n\u201dTo change, the UK and EU countries should invest in our planned 4000 km pipeline to bring Nigerian gas \u2013 the largest reserves in Africa \u2013 via Morocco, then onto Europe.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the gas pipeline project, connecting Nigeria to Europe which was conceived four years ago, had since been unveiled.\n\n\u201dLast week (June 2) \u2013 in record time \u2013 the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) entered into an agreement with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for its construction.\n\n\u201dConcurrently on July 1, the NNPC will become a Limited Liability Company and be subject to more robust auditing and commercial disclosure obligations.\n\n\u201dIt will help stimulate investment and boost transparency, where corruption has deterred the former and stymied the latter.\n\n\u201dMy administration is the first to pass this landmark reform in our oil and gas sector, after two decades of predecessors\u2019 failure to do so \u2013 no doubt due to vested interests,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari, however, noted that criminality and terrorism in Nigeria\u2019s oil-producing regions had continued to hamper oil production.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the Western allies to sanction all terrorist groups operating in the Niger Delta region and other oil producing states in the South-East and South South zones.\n\n\u201dIt would help if our western allies designated IPOB as a terrorist group, given their complicity in damage to pipelines and infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president revealed that the country had invested in the security forces, including the one billion dollars military deal with the U.S. for the acquisition of A-29 Super Tucano aircraft.\n\n\u201dThese efforts are making an impact: wells that had to be closed due to criminality have now re-opened.\n\n\u201dWith these efforts, OPEC has raised our quota for next month,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the call for the removsl of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, for showing interest to contest for the office of the President, the president said it was the responsibility of the CBN\u2019s board of directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions had fallen foul of the laws.\n\n\u2018 \u2018The CBN governor is appointed by the President.\n\n\u201dBut this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s board of directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\n\n\u201dBut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again.\n\n\u2018 \u2018Instead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy.\n\n\u201dNigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn whether the president plans to endorse a candidate for president in 2023 general elections, Buhari simply said: \u201dYes.

          "text": "Two rescued Chibok school girls, Mary Dauda and Hauwa Joseph, have revealed that more than 20 missing others are still in Gazuwa camp in Sambisa Forest, eight years after being kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nThe duo were part of the over 250 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok in Borno State abducted by Boko Haram in 2014.\n\nGazuwa camp is the acclaimed Headquarters of Jam\u0101\u2019at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da\u2019wah wa\u2019l-Jih\u0101d, Boko Haram faction.\n\nThe faction, formerly known as Gabchari, Mantari and Mallum Masari, occupies the area located about nine kilometres to Bama Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nThe ladies disclosed this while interacting with newsmen on Tuesday in Maiduguri at a news conference at the Command and Control Centre, Maimalari Cantonment.\n\nDauda recounted her experience in the hands of the insurgents, noting that she could still vividly recall her compulsory marriage eight years ago after she was abducted at the age of 18 years.\n\nDauda said that she walked through the deadly forest for many days before she found help.\n\nLike the others conscripted by the militants, she had been told that she would be hunted down and killed if she deserted.\n\nShe said: \u201cI took excuse from Malam Ahmed that I will be visiting my relative from Chibok in the town of Ngoshe and he gave me one week.\n\n\u201cThat is when I began my journey for freedom.\n\n\u201cI left Sabil Huda, popularly known as the camp of Abubakar Shekau, and proceeded towards Njimiya and Parisu, where I met some of the Mujahedeens.\n\n\u201cThey asked where I was going to and I told them I was given permission to visit my sister in Ngoshe.\n\n\u201cI finally arrived Gava village in Gwoza, after walking for many hours through the deadly forest under hardship condition.\n\n\u201cI asked some people to direct me to the home of daughter of Chibok.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting her, I told her of my plans to return home.\n\n\u201cShe told me she had wanted to come with me but her husband has placed her on strict surveillance for attempting to run.\n\n\u201cI then left her and proceeded toward Ngoshe town.\n\n\u201cOn my way, I met an old man who promised to help me to escape.\n\n\u201cBut he told me that it won\u2019t be possible in the afternoon until the sun had set.\n\n\u201cAt about 8pm, he took me to Ngoshe town and told me to pass the night in the outskirt of the town and proceed the next morning.\n\n\u201cWhen the day broke, I took myself to some soldiers, where I was rescued with my baby.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Joseph said she was forcefully married to Amir Abbah, Commander of Boko Haram (Munzul), at Gazuwa camp, who was later killed during an encounter with the troops of the Nigerian Army.\n\nShe said she voluntarily escaped from the camp of the terrorists during massive incursion of the troops of the Nigerian Army into their camp in Gazuwa on June 12.\n\nJoseph said as people were running the same direction, where the sect members are hiding women and children, she took a separate route to escape from the terrorists camp.\n\nShe said on her way, she met with some of the insurgents who asked her where she was going, but she tricked them and told them that she was following some women to hide in the nearby forest.\n\nShe added: \u201cI slept under the tree with my child, then proceeded the next day until I arrived the road where I approached a military checkpoint.\n\n\u201cInitially, they thought I was a suicide bomber, but when I explained my self, they took me along with them.\u201d\n\nJoseph thanked the military for rescuing her, saying that she hoped other girls still in the camps of the terrorists would be rescued.\n\nMajor General Christopher Musa, The Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai North East Joint Operation, said both girls were among the list of the missing Chibok girls.\n\nMusa said that the girls were rescued due to a massive military operation in Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountain and Lake Chad area.\n\n\u201cWe are putting more efforts to ensure that the rest of the girls are rescued through the ongoing Operation Lake and Desert Sanity,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Major General Waidi Shuaibu, the General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, said the girls were rescued between June 12 and 14, 2022 around Bama and Gwoza general area.\n\nShuaibu said the girls had received necessary medical attention and would be handed over to the appropriate authorities shortly.\n\nBoko Haram kidnapped 276 female students, aged between 16 and 18, from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State in April 2014.\n\nOver 100 of the girls were still missing as at April 14, 2021, seven years after the initial kidnapping.",

          "text": "One of the viable ways of achieving harm associated with tobacco smoking is to have alternative products that will reduce risks to individuals, Gizelle Baker, Vice President Global and Scientific Engagement of Philip Morris International (PMI), has said.\n\nSpeaking at Open Science, a PMI event that focuses on the concept of tobacco harm reduction and the role scientifically substantiated smoke-free products can play by complementing existing tobacco control measures, Baker said the next available challenge is to make people switch to the products.\n\nThe world currently has about 1.1 billion smokers, most of whom are at the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer and other smoking related diseases, fueling the call for aggressive efforts towards tobacco harm reduction.\n\nBaker noted that tested and proven scientific data which have indicated the possibility of a decline in the risk of having cardiovascular diseases when people quit smoking or in the minimum, switch to the use of alternative products, is at the heart of the harm reduction campaign.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe acceptability of the product is very important\u201d, Dr Baker, an epidemiologist and an expert in tobacco harm reduction, has said while noting that people who quit smoking completely have reduced risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\u201cTo achieve harm reduction, we need products that will reduce the risk to individuals that use these products. The next is to make people switch to these products and continue to use them. There is a reduction in risk of having cardiovascular disease when one quits smoking. There is also a reduction when people quit and switch to alternative products\u201d\n\nFor his part, Peter Harper, a physician and medical oncologist who said studies about the global trend in prevalence of smoking show that there is a decrease, said the newer products, if used, can significantly reduce harm.\n\n\u201cAdvertising, high taxes have not been able to discourage people from smoking. Currently, the world has 1.1bn smokers, all of whom are at the risk of lung cancer and other diseases. Therefore, the ideal thing is for smokers to quit.\n\n\u201cIf they cannot quit, they should use alternative products. However, the world has to use all the tricks it can to get people to quit smoking\u201d Harper added.\n\nThe way to maximise harm reduction potential is to eliminate tobacco completely but using alternatives like the heated tobacco products or e-cigarettes where cessation is not possible, can help to reduce harm.\n\nPanelists at the event said data from researches so far conducted suggest that using alternative products to cigarettes like vaping, oral smokeless, can significantly reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases.\n\nThe panelist, however, admitted that more than anything, people need to have big behavioral changes and insisted that even though quitting remains the best option, where that is not possible, smokers should switch to alternative products to help reduce harm.",

          "title": "CJN to angry Supreme Court Justices: Your protest akin to dancing in market square",
          "text": "Chief Justice of Nigeria Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad has disputed the allegations of poor welfare levelled against him by his brother Justices at the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a long petition to the CJN by some of the Justices, they alleged poor power supply, non-availability of diesel to power their generators, and also claimed they had no vehicles among several others.\n\nAnd in his first official reaction made public Tuesday in Abuja, the CJN admitted that the Supreme Court, like any other establishment in the country, had been hard hit by devastating economic crunch.\n\nAs a result of the economic crunch, the CJN said, the leadership of the court under him could no longer meet some of its obligations to Justices, especially in the area of welfare.\n\nHe, however, said the memo sent to him by the aggrieved Justices notwithstanding, there is no hostility among the top jurists.\n\nThe CJN\u2019s reaction was contained in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Strategy, Ahuraka Yusuf Isah, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent. The statement was entitled: \u201cState Of Affairs In The Supreme Court And Demand By Justices Of The Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe Chief Justice of Nigeria, Hon Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammad would wish to confirm receipt of letter written and addressed to him by his brother Justices of the Supreme Court Bench.\n\n\u201cJudges in all climes are to be seen and not heard, and that informed why the CJN refrained from joining issues until a letter, said to be personal, is spreading across the length and breadth of the society.\n\n\u201cThis was akin to dancing naked at the market square by us with the ripple effect of the said letter.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court definitely does not exist outside its environment, it is also affected by the economic and socio-political climate prevailing in the country. Besides that, the Apex Court has to a larger extent, been living to its constitutional responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhen a budget is made, it contains two sides, that\u2019s the recurrent and the capital, yet all the two are broken down into items. The Federal Government releases the budget based on the budget components. And it\u2019s an offence to spend the money meant for one item for another.\n\n\u201cTake for instance, the Supreme Court budgeted this year to re-roof and rehabilitate its complex built over 30 years ago and that is being done.\n\n\u201cThe work on the extension of the complex is near completion, the esthetic lawns and cleanness of the perimeters are being well kept, and security and water supply are adequately provided for his brother Justices in their offices and residences.\n\n\u201cDuring the period of pandemic, a profound and extra-care was maintained to avoid causalities among them as well as the staff generally. It would have amounted to an act of irresponsibility to divert money meant for the above for otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe accusation so far, in summary is that more or all ought to have been done and not that nothing has been done; which is utopian in the contemporary condition of our country.\n\n\u201cBefore eight new Justices were appointed in 2020 onto the Apex Court bench, there was no additional budget to provide new chambers with equipped library, legal assistance, residential accommodations and logistics for them.\n\n\u201cThe Apex Court has to make do with the resources at its disposal to meet their needs over time. All the Justices of this Court have at least a legal Assistant, except some may opt for more.\n\n\u201cOne of the CJN\u2019s legal Assistants (now Justice Aina) was appointed to Abuja FCT High Court last month, while another (Barr Ramatu) died three months back. Generally the Judiciary is looking up to recruitment of more legal assistance and other supporting staff this year.\n\n\u201cBesides, two Supreme Court Justices died within the period under consideration. Both the four retirees and the two departed cost the court some funds in the forms of gratuities and allowances.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, eight Supreme Court Justices were nominated for a workshop in London as the court cannot take all of them there at once otherwise the job would suffer. They would be going in batches.\n\n\u201cAccommodations are being gradually provided for the few that are yet to get. There is none of the Apex Court Justices without SUV and back up cars. If any of them were purchased but refurbished, the external and internal auditors are here in the court to take those that bought them up over it.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of electricity tariff and diesel are national problem. The Chief Registrar might have budgeted for N300 per litre but diesel is now selling for over N700 per litre and therefore has to find a way around it without even bringing it to the attention of the CJN. But there is no way the generator would be put off if the Court is sitting.\n\n\u201cThe amendment of court rules is on the process, it has to be critically reviewed to avoid conflict with the constitution and other extant laws. Not all the CJN has reviewed the rules in the past. Within the three years his brother Justices mentioned came the pandemic and the judiciary workers\u2019 strike.\n\n\u201cThe internet services have been restored to Justices\u2019 residences and chambers, just as some allowances have been paid to them. The CJN held a meeting with his brother Justices last Thursday and another one is due to hold this week.\n\n\u201cThe general public should be rest assured that there\u2019s no hostility or adverse feelings amongst the Justices of the Supreme Court, as everyone is going about his normal duty.\u201d\n\nAwomolo speaks\n\nSpeaking on the development, a member of the Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (BOSAN), Chief Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN) told Blueprint on the telephone Tuesday that the Body of Benchers, the highest body in the legal profession, had weighed into the matter.\n\nAwomolo, who cautioned the press against making the issue a storm in a teacup, charged the Fourth Estate of the realm to hold its peace and allow the body conclude its intervention.\n\n\u201cThis is the making of the press making a storm in a tea cup and calling it inappropriately. I am aware that the Body of Benchers, the highest body in the Legal profession, is fully dealing with the matter. The press should hold its peace until the Body concludes its intervention,\u201d said the top BOSAN member.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE top eighty-one (81) students have emerged from the over 12,000 students vying for a spot in the finals of the fourth edition of the InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition. These students were shortlisted following the nationwide computer-based tests (CBT) that served as a basis for preogression into the competition.\n\nInterswitchSPAK, a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative of Africa\u2019s leading integrated payments and digital commerce company, Interswitch, in its fourth year, continues to drive and reward interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\n\nThe CBT exams were taken in two stages: the first was taken from June 2, 2022, to June 5, 2022, and the second stage on June 8, 2022, trimming the number of registered participants from 12,014 to 500 and finally to 81. These 81 students who scaled the screening process are representatives of 13 schools.\n\nSome of the schools whose students scaled through both the first and second rounds include Adedokun International School, Ota; The Ambassador College, Ota; Marist Brothers\u2019 Juniorate, Uturu, Abia; Faith Academy Canaan Land, Ota; Loyola Jesuit College, Abuja; and Mount Olive College, Anambra.\n\nOthers include Greater Tomorrow International College, Arigidi, Ondo State; Bofoat Model College, Ondo State; FUTA Staff Secondary School Akure, Ondo; Seolad International College, Ogun; Great Cornerstone International Science College, Ondo State; Apt Scholars Universal College, Ogun State; and Oritamefa Baptist Model School, Ibadan.\n\nSpeaking on the importance of InterswitchSPAK and the need to encourage and reward more students in Africa to take up STEM subjects, the Group Chief Marketing and Corporate Communications Officer, Interswitch, Cherry Eromosele, noted that Africans should play a more central role in mapping out the future of Africa.\n\nEromosele added that the continent was ripe for development at the same scale as observed in the developed world, adding that this development had been proven to be spurred by the knowledge and application of STEM.\n\nShe said, \u201cInterswitchSPAK remains an integral expression of the belief we hold at Interswitch, which is that Africa\u2019s story can be changed from the inside out. And what this means is that only through the active participation of Africans can the change we seek come about.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we leverage the InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition, now in its fourth run, to encourage young Africans to find value in STEM subjects that have been identified as drivers of economic prosperity, something that we at Interswitch have seen firsthand.\u201d\n\nSince inception, InterswitchSPAK has continued to champion the study of STEM subjects among students in Africa, as the competition has moved beyond a locally-organized initiative and has expanded to other parts of Africa such as Kenya in East Africa.\n\nThe InterswitchSPAK competition bestows on students rewards for their interest in STEM, with the first-place winner going home with N7.5 million in scholarships over a five-year period, a laptop, and monthly stipends. The second-place winner will go home with N4 million in scholarships, a laptop, and monthly stipends for a period of 3 years. The third-place winner will go home with N1 million in scholarship for a year, monthly stipends, and a laptop.\n\nLast year\u2019s winners were Jubril Dokun of Brainfield College, Salolo, Lagos State, receiving the first prize; the second-place winner was Ayanlade Jesuferanmi of Obafemi Awolowo University International School, Ile-Ife, and Omoniyi Qudus of Scholars Universal Secondary School, Ota, Ogun State, came in third place.",

          "text": "PALMA ILEYE\n\nExecutive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, NCDMB, Engr Simbi Kesiye Wabote, has stressed that there was an urgent need for the Federal Government and other stakeholders of the oil and gas industry to intensify efforts in the promotion of quality petroleum education and development of competent manpower which would help Nigeria meet the challenges of the ongoing energy transition and expected boom in the gas sector.\n\nWabote made the emphasis while giving a key recommendation at the convocation lecture he delivered at the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPRE, Effurun, Delta State, titled \u201cDefining the Value of Local Content in Petroleum Education.\u201d\n\nHe canvassed that as western nations shift their attention from oil and gas and focus on the provision of funding, manufacturing of equipment, and development of supply chain to support their renewable energy sources, it was imperative that Nigeria and other hydrocarbon-rich countries develop the requisite capacity and capability to produce and utilize their fossil fuel resources.\n\nAccording to him, the ongoing debate and the deadlines being set in respect of energy transition underscored the need to develop home-grown skill sets to develop and manage the nation\u2019s natural resources.\n\nHe also stressed that \u201cthe narrative around energy transition has further revealed the need to ensure that there is a direct link between our petroleum education and the development and utilization of our hydrocarbon resources, so we are able to deal with any outcome of the transition.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the recent enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 and the Decade of Gas initiative, Wabote pointed out that those developments would not only engender investments and utilization of the nation\u2019s estimated 600 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves but also lead to a boom in the gas sector, which would benefit discerning institutions, investors, operators, and service providers.\n\nHe added that \u201cthese scenarios require a robust petroleum education sector to ensure that our in-country skill sets are available and sufficient to support the exploration, development, production, and processing of hydrocarbon resources.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary charged educational institutions in Nigeria to prepare for the opportunities and challenges of energy transition and gas revolution by preparing robust curriculum in petroleum education with the mindset of enabling Nigerians develop and utilize our hydrocarbon resources using our home-grown technology.\n\nThe institutions should put require greater focus on development of top-notch graduates to enable the development of Nigerian hydrocarbon resources \u2013 especially gas, he canvassed.\n\nThis he further explained, \u201cwill ensure that we are not forced out from the development of hydrocarbon resources due to lack of technical capability as was the case with coal development in Enugu.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that FUPRE was an institution devoted to petroleum education and should be at the forefront of preparing our manpower needs for any outcome or impact of Energy Transition.\n\nHe agreed on the need to add renewables to the global energy mix to ensure energy security, but criticised attempts by the western world to demonize or de-marketing other energy sources as well as extracting commitments and setting unrealistic deadlines for countries to abandon fossil fuels.\n\nHe advised all nations to jealously guard their locally available sources of energy and ensure they remain in their energy mix for the benefit of their people.\n\nHe also highlighted two implications that have emerged from the rush to move the world away from fossil fuels and they include Divestment, whereby western countries shift funding away from the development of hydrocarbons towards renewable energy and Energy Shortage, which is the decline in the supply of hydrocarbons due to lack of investments and the fast pace of the shift to renewable energies.\n\nHe posited that Divestment has resulted in the emergence of indigenous companies playing major roles in exploration and production activities \u201csuch that companies like AITEO, FIRST E&P, EROTON, and others have acquired assets and are now responsible for producing about 15% of Nigeria\u2019s oil and more than 60% of domestic gas.\u201d\n\nHe however regretted that the divestment of the international oil companies and their reluctance to make further investments in oil and gas have resulted in the repatriation of capital out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis stifles the nation\u2019s economy of the much-needed foreign exchange with funds used as loans to acquire oil and gas assets instead of being used to develop new production assets,\u201d he rued.",

          "text": "President of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), Festus Osifo, has shed light on the reasons behind the fuel scarcity experienced across the country, particularly in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nDuring an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily, he highlighted the issue of \u2018bridging funds\u2019 between the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) and truck drivers who deliver the Premium Motor Spirits (PMS).\n\nRead Also: Selling Petrol At N165 Unrealistic, Says IPMAN As Scarcity Hits Lagos\n\n\u201cThe NMDPRA are the ones administering a bridging fund. At a particular time, they agreed with truck drivers that the bridging fund is going to be about N10 per litre depending on the destination you\u2019re going to all over the country.\n\n\u201cAs at when they agreed, the cost of diesel was about N250 so it was fashionable and the N10 was a bit okay but today, the cost of diesel is over N700. It has tripled. So, the expectations from the tanker drivers is that since the cost has gone up, instead of paying me N10.40kobo as the case may be, you have to multiply it by three.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, that is the first problem\u201d.\n\nContrary to the belief that PMS is scarce, the PENGASSAN boss said that there\u2019s at least 2 billion litres in stock.\n\n\u201cAs at today, we have close to 2 billion litres of PMS, so the problem is not the stock,\u201d he said, explaining that while the stock is available, most of the truck drivers are not willing to move these products \u201cbecause of the previous problem I just enumerated\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues again is that today, NNPC is the sole importer of PMS, so they import PMS into the country, and this PMS is brought to the high sea, so they rent some smaller vessels to bunker the PMS and take to the various tank farms or depots. So, if it\u2019s the NNPC depots and you are loading from the NNPC depots, you are going to pay abut N148 as the ex-depot price. But some of the PMS are also stored in private depots and those private depots don\u2019t sell to the retailers for 148; they add some premium to it, at the end the of the day, they sell between 152, 155, 160 and 162.\n\n\u201cSo, if they sell at that amount, it will now be difficult for the retailer to go and sell at the same amount.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhamamdu Buhari has defended the Federal Government\u2019s decision to keep paying fuel subsidies.\n\nIn a response to Bloomberg, the President said the effects of removing fuel subsidies would have been too harsh on the Nigerian people.\n\nHe said the government is working on boosting local capacity in order to stem the inflationary pressures that are likely to be triggered by a removal of subsidies.\n\n\u201cMost western countries are today implementing fuel subsidies. Why would we remove ours now?\u201d What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d The President said.",

          "text": "The United Nations (UN) has raised an alarm that 4.1 million people in the north-eastern Nigeria are at severe risk of severe food insecurity and starvation.\n\nAccording to the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Mr. Matthias Schmale to avert this $351 million was required, which he said was part of the overall request of $1.1 billion for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, that is severely under-funded at 19.6 per cent.\n\nSchmale while briefing Member States of the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday, on the needs, challenges and windows of opportunity in the north-east said: \u201cI cannot emphasise enough, we need the resources today and not tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe said as north-east Nigeria continues to face an unrelenting humanitarian crisis, 4.1 million people in region were at risk of severe food insecurity this season, noting that people in that region are already vulnerable after struggling through 12 years of conflict.\n\nHe added that in 2022, 8.4 million people would need humanitarian assistance across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, while describing the deteriorating food security and nutrition situation as an issue that requires immediate support.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis food insecurity is felt painfully across the region, especially as operations are so desperately in need of funding. In Yobe State, families have not received food assistance for up to eight months. Some people are left without food for days not knowing where their next meal will come from.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the March 2022 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9, a tool used to identify areas at risk from food insecurity and malnutrition in the Sahel and West Africa, projected that between June and September, 4.1 million people would be food insecure.\n\nAmong them, almost 600,000 people were projected to be at emergency levels (Phase 4), which was characterised by large food consumption gaps reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality.\n\nHe noted that this high-risk period, the lean season, overlaps with the rainy season, a time when children are left vulnerable from disease outbreaks, with weakened resistance if malnourished, disclosing that malnutrition among children grows increasingly dangerous in the north-east.\n\nHe said approximately, 1.74 million children under five were estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition across the north-east in 2022, and of these, over 300,000 were estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and are at high risk of death if they do not receive urgent treatment.\n\nHe, however, said a multi-sector response plan had been put in place by the UN and humanitarian partners to provide life-saving aid and prevent a potentially catastrophic food and nutrition situation, stating that the plan required $351 million, and was part of the overall request of $1.1 billion for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, which is severely under-funded at 19.6 per cent.\n\nHe revealed that the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan aims to assist 5.5 million people in need, describing it as a two-track process, where, \u201cthe bulk of interventions focus on emergency assistance, but at same time our approach aims to lift people out of vulnerable situations and reduce humanitarian need by increasingly focusing on durable solutions and building resilience where possible.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari Defends Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Chief Emefiele, Says Unorthodox Policies Best for Economy",
          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, defended the policies being implemented by Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, saying rather than follow textbook solutions developed in the more advanced climes, which may not be suitable for Nigeria, the apex bank\u2019s head has rightly resorted to \u201cunorthodox\u201d measures in trying to resolve the country\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nIn his written responses to Bloomberg\u2019s interview questions, Buhari said the accusations against Emefiele by detractors, including being labelled as \u201cpolitical\u201d, had more to do with the methods he was deploying to try to revamp the Nigerian economy, rather than the substance of the allegations.\n\nThe president maintained that every country should have the right to choose its economic model and policies, insisting that the CBN chief is facing criticisms because he is not following traditional methods, which have failed in the past.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cBut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again.\n\n\u201cInstead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the independence of the office of the CBN governor, given Emefiele\u2019s alleged interest in the just-concluded presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president said if there were infractions, the board of the apex bank was better placed to sanction the governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s Board of Directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nA critical actor in the federal government\u2019s efforts to boost local food production, the CBN has provided loans to farmers and restricted access to foreign exchange for importers of dozens of products, actions for which it has received flaks.\n\nBut Buhari insisted that food price inflation in the country could have been worse if Emefiele had not initiated organised programmes to boost domestic production, stressing that even at that , Nigeria still does not grow enough domestically.\n\nHe pointed out that initiatives, such as the Anchor Borrower\u2019s Programme, boosted rice production to nine million metric tonnes in 2021, from around 5.4 million metric tonnes in 2015.\n\n\u201cEven in the years of drought, rice production outstripped pre-2015 levels. Imports have fallen to near zero. We are making progress,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn why he had continued to retain subsidy on petrol, the president noted that even most Western countries were currently implementing fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhy would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, while the removal of subsidy may look good on paper, the impact on Nigerians would be largely negative and unbearable.\n\n\u201cWhat our Western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things,\u201d the president maintained.\n\nBuhari added that while his government had put in motion plans to remove fuel subsidy late last year, after further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\nWhile internal production for refined products would help mitigate the effect of subsidy removal, the president projected that capacity would increase markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries come on board.\n\nBuhari posited that he was winning the war against corruption, starting with the Whistleblowing Policy enacted in his first year in office, revealing that hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned within Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the monies had now been deployed as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the COVID-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rail, and power.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more than N152 billion has been recovered. Dollar recoveries for the year amount to over $386 million; GBP more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million, some more in digital and other currencies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Buhari had said international partners refused to return funds they held for decades to previous Nigerian administrations in the certainty they would simply be re-stolen.\n\n\u201cThey changed their approach with us because they knew my administration could be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said that his successor would inherit a far more resilient economy, thanks to investments in infrastructure and policies that he said had bolstered local production.\n\nOn security, the president reiterated that the military had recovered all territories previously held by Boko Haram, repeating his often-held position that terrorists no longer hold any territory in Nigeria while their leaders are now deceased.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Air Force airstrike in March.\u201d\n\nHe stated that jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations. He said these stood as testament to new trust re-built between Nigeria and its Western allies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader urged its international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and designating them as a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes.\n\n\u201cGovernors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe further opined that international trade remained rigged against food security in Africa, explaining that while the European Union\u2019s policies are all rhetoric of open trade, their common agricultural policy undermines Africa\u2019s self-sufficiency and grows poverty.\n\nOn the rising spate of religion-related killings, especially regarding the question of alleged blasphemy, the president declared that no one has any right to break the law and urged Christians and Muslims to respect each other\u2019s differences.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "text": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince is to visit Turkey for the first time since the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan will hold one-on-one talks with Mohammed bin Salman aimed at repairing damaged ties.\n\nMr Erdogan once indirectly accused the prince of ordering Saudi agents to kill Khashoggi. He denied any involvement.\n\nThe visit comes as Turkey seeks trade, investment and assistance to help it deal with a worsening economic crisis.\n\nIt has also worked to improve relations with the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel after years of tensions.\n\nPrince Mohammed meanwhile wants to end his international isolation.\n\nHe also visited Jordan and Egypt this week as part of a Middle East tour and next month will meet US President Joe Biden, who promised in 2019 to make Saudi Arabia \u201cthe pariah that they are\u201d over Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nKhashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and prominent critic of Prince Mohammed, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, where he had gone to get papers needed to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nA UN investigator concluded that he was \u201cbrutally slain\u201d by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents sent from Riyadh, and that his body was dismembered. She made that judgement after listening to purported audio recordings of conversations inside the consulate made by Turkish intelligence.\n\nWhile Mr Erdogan did not directly accuse Prince Mohammed, he claimed he knew the order to kill Khashoggi \u201ccame from the highest levels of the Saudi government\u201d.\n\nUS intelligence agencies concluded that the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.\n\nSaudi prosecutors blamed \u201crogue\u201d agents and said the prince had no knowledge of the operation.\n\nA year after the killing, a Saudi court found five unnamed people guilty of directly participating in the killing and handed them death sentences that were later commuted to 20-year prison terms, while three others were jailed for seven to 10 years for covering up the crime.\n\nPresident Erdogan said last week that his talks in Ankara with Prince Mohammed \u2013 who is Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader \u2013 would focus on advancing relations between the regional powers to a \u201cmuch higher level\u201d.\n\nA senior Turkish official told Reuters news agency that the visit was expected to bring \u201ca full normalisation and a restoration of the pre-crisis period\u201d, with the two leaders signing agreements on energy, economy and security.\n\nBut Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), criticised Mr Erdogan for inviting Prince Mohammed and choosing to \u201cembrace the man who ordered the killing\u201d of Khashoggi.\n\nIn April, Mr Erdogan flew to Saudi Arabia and publicly embraced the prince, as their countries began what he called a \u201cnew period of co-operation\u201d.\n\nThat visit came three weeks after a court in Istanbul stopped the trial in absentia of 26 Saudi nationals, including two of the crown prince\u2019s aides, accused over the Khashoggi murder.\n\nThe judge said the case would be handed over to judicial authorities in Saudi Arabia, which had refused to extradite the suspects.\n\nThe move was denounced as a whitewash by human rights activists and Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who vowed to continue her fight for justice.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s debt-laden economy has \u201ccollapsed\u201d after months of shortages of food, fuel and electricity, its prime minister told lawmakers Wednesday, in comments underscoring the country\u2019s dire situation as it seeks help from international lenders.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament the South Asian country is \u201cfacing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity and food. Our economy has completely collapsed.\u201d\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nWhile Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis is considered its worst in recent memory, Wickremesinghe\u2019s assertion that the economy has collapsed did not cite any specific new developments. It appeared intended to emphasize to his critics and opposition lawmakers that he has inherited a difficult task that can\u2019t be fixed quickly, as the economy founders under the weight of heavy debts, lost tourism revenue and other impacts from the pandemic, as well as surging costs for commodities.\n\nLawmakers of the country\u2019s two main opposition parties are boycotting Parliament this week to protest against Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister just over a month ago and is also finance minister, for not having delivered on his pledges to turn the economy around.\n\nWickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is unable to purchase imported fuel, even for cash, due to heavy debts owed by its petroleum corporation.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is $700 million in debt,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cAs a result, no country or organization in the world is willing to provide fuel to us. They are even reluctant to provide fuel for cash,\u201d he said.\n\nWickremesinghe took office in May after days of violent protests over the country\u2019s economic crisis forced his predecessor to step down. In his comments Wednesday, he blamed the previous government for failing to act in time to turn the situation around, as Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves dwindled.\n\nThe foreign currency crisis has crimped imports, creating severe shortages of food, fuel, electricity and other essentials like medicines, forcing people to stand in long lines to fulfill basic needs.\n\n\u201cIf steps had at least been taken to slow down the collapse of the economy at the beginning, we would not be facing this difficult situation today. But we lost out on this opportunity. We are now seeing signs of a possible fall to rock bottom,\u201d he said.\n\nSri Lanka has been muddling through mainly supported by $4 billion in credit lines from neighboring India. But Wickremesinghe said India would not be able to keep Sri Lanka afloat for too long.\n\nIt also has gotten pledges of $300 million-$600 million from the World Bank to buy medicine and other essential items.\n\nSri Lanka has already announced that it is suspending repayment of $7 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026.\n\nOfficials from International Monetary Fund are now visiting Sri Lanka to discuss a rescue package. Wickremesinghe said that a staff-level agreement is likely to be reached by the end of July.",
