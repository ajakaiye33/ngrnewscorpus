          "title": "PIB: North, Ogun\u2019s quests for oil get boost, exploration receives 30%",
          "text": "The quests for oil in the North and other parts of the country, including Ogun and Anambra states, have received a huge boost in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill which will regulate the oil sector if signed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), findings have shown.\n\nCurrently, crude oil is obtained from eight states in the Niger Delta region which include: Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers states.\n\nBased on Section 9 of the PIB, at least 30 per cent of the profit generated by the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited will go to the exploration of oil in \u2018frontier basins\u2019.\n\nAlthough the proposed law doesn\u2019t identify the frontier basins, a statement by the President in 2019 identified the frontier basins as Chad Basin, Gongola Basin, Anambra Basin, Sokoto Basin, Dahomey Basin, Bida Basin and Benue Trough.\n\nBesides northern states, Ogun State, whose Tongeji Island is in Dahomey Basin , will benefit from the new policy. Anambra State, with Anambra Basin, will also benefit.\n\nThe 19 northern state governments had in 2016 intensified their search for oil and gas in the region with the appointment of a British firm to carry out the exploration activities which was sequel to Buhari\u2019s directive to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to increase the tempo of the crude oil find in the North-East.\n\nThe Chairman, Northern Nigeria Development Company, owned by the 19 northern state governments, Mallam Bashir Dalhatu, had said the British company had commenced its prospects for oil and gas in the Lake Chad and Benue basins, using the services of the British company.\n\nDalhatu had said, \u201cWe have engaged a British company that is already working in the Lake Chad region and from Niger and Chad side in the same area with us and we have been meeting with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in order to put efforts together.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has also re-emphasised to us, during those meetings, its total support for exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the North-East of the country.\u201d\n\nWith the passage of the PIB, however, the oil exploration move of the 19 northern governors has received a huge boost.\n\nSection 9(4) of the PIB reads, \u201cThe frontier exploration fund shall be 10 per cent of rents on petroleum prospecting licences and 10 per cent on petroleum mining leases; and 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas as in product sharing, profit sharing and risk service contracts. The fund shall be applied to all basins and undertaken simultaneously.\u201d\n\nSection 9(5) adds, \u201cNNPC Limited shall transfer the 30 per cent of profit oil and profit gas to the frontier exploration fund escrow account dedicated for the development of frontier acreages only.\u201d\n\nThe PIB also makes provision for the establishment of a Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission which will be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of upstream petroleum operations and also promote the exploration of frontier basins in Nigeria\n\nPIB passed by National Assembly, a sham, it\u2019s like robbing Peter Paul \u2013 Rep\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmaker representing Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency in Rivers State at the House of Representatives, Farah Dagogo, has condemned the PIB\n\nDagogo, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, in an interview with journalists on Sunday, said the PIB \u201chas been received with mixed feelings by some prominent personalities in the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the bill, when it becomes law, would revolutionise the petroleum sector to be competitive for economic development, the lawmaker said he had reviewed the objectives of the bill and discovered some irregularities.\n\nDagogo said, \u201cA critical analysis and review shows that the bill passed leaves more questions than answers for resolving the gamut of challenges associated with the petroleum industry, which first governing law was enacted in 1969.\n\n\u201cSo, the answer to your questions, with all intents and purposes, is that the core content of the passed bill could be regarded as a sham and a bogus display of an infamous fluke orchestrated by the majority against the minority, whose land and people are afflicted amidst affluence.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates the unending reasons for the vociferous calls for restructuring because of disorder and injustice that currently permeate the Nigerian state. Indeed, it was a ploy to further rob Peter and pay Paul.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the grey areas in the PIB, the lawmaker said, \u201cA critique of the passed bill shows some enervating factors that are highly disturbing: First, the Senate\u2019s reduction of compensations payment for host communities from 5 per cent to 3 per cent, against the cries and appeals of southern senators; second, the redefinition of host community to mean any \u201ccommunity that oil pipeline passes through.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy implication, host communities will now imply (that) all states that do not even produce oil but have oil pipelines passing through them. Before now, host communities were communities that produce oil or have petroleum facilities/installations in their land.\u201d\n\nDagogo added, \u201cThe passed bill also has a jargon known as \u2018Frontier Exploration\u2019 for which the bill has provided 30 per cent of NNPC profits to be servicing these \u2018Frontier Explorations\u2019 yearly. This, I dare say, is over-ambitious and very unsustainable. My constituents interpret this to mean that a certain percentage of revenue, say hypothetically 30 per cent from mines or gold from the North is set aside for gold and mine exploration from the ocean in the South.\n\n\u201cHow do you justify this bare faced farce? You get the point? It is just another avenue of exacerbating corruption and appears to be a desideratum to fraud. This does not guarantee the fiscal direction and original intent of the bill, which seeks to provide legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry and the development of host communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker noted that while development of host communities was visibly and conspicuously displayed in the long title of the PIB, which consequently gave direction to the problems the bill intended to resolve, \u201cthe National Assembly, dominated by the All Progressives Congress, has negated that trust; and the upper chamber (Senate) wherein the bill originated from, surreptitiously decided and wittingly, they changed the order and concocted a discordant view, which could be regarded as an anathema to natural justice.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about efforts by the minority caucuses to protect their interests in the PIB, Dagodo said, \u201cThe bill as passed is a perpetration of the existing oligarchic spirit fanned by the colonial masters. The challenges that led to Sir Willick\u2019s Commission of Inquiry on the minorities are still very fresh and the ghost still chases modern Nigeria. It is still very inherent in the Nigerian system and PIB has exemplified it.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "17 southern govs discuss Buhari\u2019s land recovery order for herders",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s (retd.) order on the recovery of grazing routes for herders will top the agenda of today\u2019s meeting of 17 southern governors, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which would hold eight weeks after the governors met in Asaba, the Delta State capital, would further assess decisions taken in Asaba on the open grazing ban, restructuring, fiscal federalism and the call for state police.\n\nThe governors would be hosted by Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, at the meeting which would start by 10am today (Monday).\n\nAside from the host governor, others expected at the meeting are Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Emmanuel Udom (Akwa Ibom) Diri Duoye (Bayelsa), Willie Obiano (Anambra), Ben Ayade (Cross Rivers), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), David Umahi (Ebonyi), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Olukayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Adegboyega Oyetola (Osun), Oluwaseyi Makinde (Oyo), and Nyesom Wike (Rivers).\n\nRecall that the governors in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting in Asaba, banned open grazing as part of moves to address killings and kidnapping by herdsmen.\n\nBut a few days after the meeting, the Presidency faulted the ban on open grazing. The Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, had in a statement, stated, . \u201cIt is equally true that their (governors\u2019) announcement is of questionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT)-regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, slammed the southern governors for banning open grazing.\n\nAccording to the AGF, open grazing ban is the same thing as Northern governors banning spare parts trading in their own region considering the fact that southerners comprise a majority of spare parts traders in the North.\n\nThe President during a recorded television interview in June also backed Malami\u2019s position, adding that he had directed that grazing routes be recovered.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position, Buhari had responded, \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general?\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said, \u201cWhat I did was to ask him to go and dig the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The PUNCH on Sunday, a top source close to one of the governors said the southern governors were disturbed about Buhari\u2019s order on grazing routes, adding that they suspected a hidden agenda.\n\nThe source also stated, \u201cThe governors will meet physically tomorrow (Monday) in Alausa, Lagos. All the 17 governors in Southern Nigeria will be present at the meeting. They will speak on some of the issues they raised in Asaba.\u201d\n\nAsked of the issues that would top agenda at the meeting, another source close to one the governors in the South-West, South-South and South-East said the governors would deliberate on the pronouncement of the President.\n\nThe source, who wished to remain anonymous because he was not authorised to speak on the matter said, \u201cThey would discuss the issue of security and open grazing ban. They are going to focus on topical political issues. The governors will be deliberating on the recent order by the President that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, recover some lands for herdsmen to graze in the country. They believe it is an agenda to Fulanise the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, one of the information managers to one of the governors in the region, said, \u201cThe meeting will address killings in spite of the ban on open grazing. Aside from open grazing, restructuring, autonomy for judiciary will also be discussed.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general of the federation is not an attorney general of the Federal Government. He is an attorney general of the federation behaving like the attorney general of the Federal Government. So, any case involving anybody with the Federal Government is a lost case because you have an attorney general of the federation behaving like the attorney general of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cWhen the southern governors banned open grazing, the AGF declared the act as illegal. They didn\u2019t react when he said that. That is how mature people behave. But tomorrow, the governors will take a position on the Federal Government\u2019s reaction,\u201d the source said.\n\nAsked whether the governors would also discuss the raid by the Department of State Services on the Ibadan house of Yoruba activist Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho, the source stated, \u201cIgboho is not nationalistic. The agenda of the Southern governors is broader than Igboho but you can\u2019t rule it out that when they are talking of regional security, they would talk about him.\n\n\u201cThey spoke about him when Igboho spoke against herders-farmers crisis but they stopped talking about him the moment some people entered into his head and he started Yoruba nation rally. It is not a right time at all.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Our constitution is disincentive to economic diversification, says Moghalu",
          "text": "Kingsley Moghalu\n\nNIgeria\u2019s 1999 Constitution, by placing ownership of natural resources exclusively in the hands of the central government, creates a dis-incentive for economic diversi\ufb01cation, says Professor Kingsley Moghalu, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThis is because it hampers a regional approach to economic diversi\ufb01cation and economic management in what is a supposedly federal state, Moghalu argued.\n\nMoghalu a former flag bearer of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) expressed these views in a keynote speech delivered during the annual conference of the Nigerian Economic Students Association (NESA) in Port Harcourt on Thursday.\n\nMoghalu\u2019s paper, which was titled: \u201cEconomic Diversi\ufb01cation and the Wealth of Nations: Lessons and the Path Forward for Nigeria, argued for a constitutional restructuring that would devolve \ufb01scal autonomy to regions or states, which would engender competitive manufacturing and the diversi\ufb01cation that will drive it.\n\nAccording to Moghalu who was the Young Progressives Party (YPP) flag bearer during the 2019 Presidential election, Nigeria witnessed its best broad-based economic growth in the First Republic when resources were under regional control rather than its subsequent boom and bust cycles that were driven by reliance on oil rents.\n\nHe proposed that Nigeria\u2019s economic policy makers should help the government develop targeted export policies and incentives that would drive diversi\ufb01cation, adding that \u201cachieving economic diversi\ufb01cation in Nigeria would require a comprehensive and joined up approach to economic policy, rather than the silo approach we have seen for many years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former Presidential candidate, Nigeria cannot achieve development unless it makes economic diversification the central thrust of its policy while recommending a policy based on a clearly de\ufb01ned vision that sets out the balance between the role of the government and the role of the market.\n\nMoghalu, therefore, advised that the Economic Advisory Council to the President would need to become a full-time body because \u201cmanaging Nigeria\u2019s economy to transformation would require capable hands that work on it full-time, doing the granular work and analysis that will drive policy.\u201d\n\nIt is important, he insisted, that such a council, and the rest of the country\u2019s economic management apparatus, acquire and establish strong competence in industrial policy if our economy is to become truly diversi\ufb01ed.\n\nHe supported his argument with the models of such countries as Malaysia, Thailand and Chile For such an approach to succeed, Moghalu argued, \u201cthe two most important requirements, which are lacking in the Nigerian context, are, \ufb01rst, a clear philosophical foundation for our country\u2019s economic policy that is based on a clearly de\ufb01ned vision and sets out the balance between the role of the government and the role of the market.\u201d\n\nThis approach, he noted, has delayed development because speci\ufb01c aspects of economic policy appear to be at con\ufb02ict with stated policy objectives of diversi\ufb01cation.\n\nThe former Presidential candidate favours a competent political leadership that understands and prioritizes economic development backed by competent economic management and a capable state bureaucracy and not crony capitalism of vested interests.\n\nThe political class, the former CBN Deputy Governor insisted, needs a better understanding of the imperatives of long-term structural economic transformation with an emphasis on periodic development plans and industrialization.\n\nHe warned against undue pressure from the Bretton Woods institutions, which in the past led to a decline in structural economic thinking.\n\nThis decline, he pointed out, also led to a premature shift to extreme liberalisation of trade without an appropriate foundation of industrialization that would have made us more competitive in the global economy with diversi\ufb01ed exports.\n\nIn this context, he noted, \u201cthe failure of the Ajaokuta Steel industry represents a tragic failure of political leadership for economic transformation in Nigeria, as iron and steel are an important basis for an industrialized economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese policy errors, including a premature embrace of globalization without the structural foundation to become part of the production value chain of globalization \u2014 and thus competitive in it,\u201d he stressed, \u201chave turned Nigeria into a global market but not a global producer of the hard goods of the globalized economy.\u201d\n\nIt is going to require political leadership with a sophisticated understanding of economic transformation and the capacity and will to execute it, if Nigeria is to be able to change course in the years ahead, Moghalu warned.\n\nNigeria must become an economy driven by innovation such as financial technology which he said, would require a revamp and socialization of the idea of intellectual property, which drove innovation to become the main creator of the wealth of economically advanced countries.\n\nFor Nigeria to drive economic diversi\ufb01cation successfully, he said, special attention must be paid to trade policy realizing that for two decades running between 1998 and 2018, Nigeria\u2019s share of global merchandise exports remained virtually stagnant.\n\nThere is also the fact that most of NIgeria\u2019s trade is with advanced economies makes our trade disadvantage worse.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWith Nigeria\u2019s rati\ufb01cation of the African Continental Free Trade Act in November 2020, we must now shift our strategic trade focus toward African countries. This requires that we manufacture competitively and manage the phenomenon of dumping from foreign countries such as China.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moghalu, \u201cwe need to seek a special dispensation from the World Trade Organization\u2019s Special & Differentiated tariff regime with a compelling case for why Nigeria should adopt \u201csmart protectionism\u201d\n\nfor a limited period to ensure the survival of its Infant industry at home.\n\n\u201cIndustrial policy must be the basis of our push toward economic diversi\ufb01cation, since it is the basis on which we can push for a more favorable international trade environment,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIndustrial policy, he noted, requires a certain amount of state intervention even in a market economy, provided that such intervention is targeted and productive for broad manufacturing sectors, as opposed to special favors for individual industrialists, a policy that distorts the market playing \ufb01eld for competitors in the same sector.\n\nMoghalu added that foreign exchange policy in Nigeria needs to be revamped away from state control, \u201cwhich encourages scarcities, smuggling and arbitrage, if we are to create incentives for a diversi\ufb01ed economy.\u201d\n\nHe also added that achieving economic diversi\ufb01cation depends, at its core, on the existence of knowhow or productive knowledge. \u201cThis requires Nigeria to focus on creating the skills amongst its young population that will drive competitive manufacturing for exports.\n\n\u201cThis calls for a revamp of the education sector in favour of science and technology, at least for the next two to three decades. This is how China was able to achieve spectacular economic transformation and become the world\u2019s second largest economy.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nNollywood actress, Chioma Grace Ifemeludike has recounted the challenges she encountered as a celebrity.\n\nIn this interview, the Jos, Plateau State-born movie star shares the good, the bad and the ugly sides of her sojourn in the movie industry. Enjoy it.\n\nWhat do you consider your pains and gains as an actress?\n\nI have paid my dues. There were times that challenges of sexual harassment came. I had dated one or two guys in Nollywood, but I didn\u2019t date them because I wanted to act. These are people that I felt emotionally attached to, and along the line, something happened. There were also people who approached me for sex for roles, but I couldn\u2019t start sleeping with everyone. There were times I made mistakes in the course of my career, but I made sure I held my dignity at least to a certain level that I could defend.\n\nBasically, people judge you for what they see and not for who you are. For instance, you could borrow a car and attend shows and you gain respect. Some years back, I didn\u2019t have a car, but I had a voice. But then it can\u2019t be amplified. Back then, they saw me as just a random girl, but I knew I would get there because I kept pushing. Challenges in the industry are so many, from sexual harassment to not being treated fairly, and being belittled. I went through psychological harassment. I know some people are still going through the same thing. It has also been gainful; I\u2019m not going to deny that. Being in the spotlight or being identified as an actor or influential, people tend to see you as someone who has edge over others. I have made wonderful friends and I count that as great gains.\n\nDespite the high rate of marital crisis in the industry, are you scared of marriage?\n\nNever. I am not scared. I love the concept of marriage and I think the concept is spiritually, physically and relevantly important. Family is the smallest unit of the society; it shouldn\u2019t be undermined or underestimated. I love the idea of having people to nurture, train and care for. You never know what the nation would need them for and you watch yourself creating humans that are helpful, impacting and innovative. I am not afraid of marriage. When I was younger, I almost ventured into marriage, but it didn\u2019t work out. I have been so scared, I don\u2019t want to fail my God, children or husband, and yes I am ready for marriage. Being a celebrity doesn\u2019t stop me from going home to cook, then do other things that I was taught as an Igbo child. My culture requires I\u2019m respectful to my husband and family, and saying sorry when I am wrong.\n\nAs a single lady, do you experience lonely nights?\n\nI don\u2019t experience lonely, cold nights. I am in a very serious relationship. I\u2019m in a relationship where I\u2019m friend with my boyfriend. We are very close for quite a while now. For some good reasons, he\u2019s been around, although he doesn\u2019t stay in the country. So, I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a cold night. For me, it\u2019s been warm nights all through.\n\nCan a man control you?\n\nNot that I can\u2019t be controlled, I can be controlled if the person I\u2019m in a relationship with understands the point that we need balance and freedom. It shouldn\u2019t be control, but guidance. If you have someone you love that is an adult, then advise her not control.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on liposuction?\n\nBig boobs and backsides are now the new beauty regimes. The hourglass body is what every girl in Nigeria wants. I think it\u2019s low self-esteem. I don\u2019t have any issue with liposuction because it\u2019s a personal issue. I respect every person who chooses to do so, but personally I feel it starts from low self-esteem. I have awkward front teeth, and growing up, I have always felt low. If tomorrow I arrange it that means I feel less confident in myself. The same thing applies to bleaching. If you are proud of your skin colour, you would be like Chimamanda (Adiche), Ini Edo; these are brown skin girls who are standing on their feet, looking at the world with the gold girl attitude. But a lot of girls who have beautiful skins go to change it probably because they don\u2019t love the way they are. If you have money, go for it, but bear it in mind that you weren\u2019t confident on how God created you.\n\nDid you have any awkward experience that almost made you to dump acting?\n\nWhen you are doing a job and you see that the earnings do not match your expenditures, it becomes frustrating. How can the work you put so much energy, time and passion into not pay you enough to take care of yourself? For the past three years, I have been asking myself that if I had devoted this energy, time, resources in the banking sector, would I not be a branch manager by now?\n\nNowadays, girls are buying big, luxury cars that they post on social media; what\u2019s stopping you from getting your own?\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to buy any of such luxury cars. I have told myself that one day I would ask somebody, because the cars I see online are just so intimidating. They include Range Rover, Benz and the likes. Sometimes I ask myself if it\u2019s my village people that are behind my slow progress. I\u2019m a very strong, spiritual person. I\u2019m not religious, but then I put my head down. I would get there; its the reassurance that keeps me going.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Why trucks still park on Lagos bridges \u2013Fashola",
          "text": "Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) tells ADETUTU FOLASADE-KOYI and ISAAC ANUMIHE when the second Niger Bridge would be completed, when trailers would stop parking on Lagos bridges and the constraints in completing the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.\n\nWhen is the completion date for the Second Niger Bridge taking into consideration the effect of COVID-19 on Nigeria\u2019s finances? Has government adjusted the delivery deadline?\n\nIt is true that we have had to readjust the timeliness for the completion because of COVID-19. Not only because of the time we lost, but because of the way people have to work and also because of the limited number of people because social distancing rules still apply at our construction site because we are not out of it yet. So, I plan to pay a visit, to inspect the project. But we are looking at the second quarter of next year. There are still so many variables. Some of the variables may not be visible to you. We are moving transmission lines. To move those transmission lines, you have to shut down power. We have to do it in collaboration with Ministry of Power and the Transmission Company of Nigeria. So, it is not just the road. There are so many other things like compensation, relocation. There are lots of things we are responding to.\n\nAre you not worried about trailers parking on the bridges in Lagos?\n\nWell, we are worried about it and that is why I said earlier that we are compelled to address so much at the same time. The president is so clear in his mind that unless you quickly bridge this infrastructure gap, it is going to be difficult to release the energy of Nigeria. Once the roads are better, the train is moving, airports are bigger and more comfortable, there will be energy and so on and so forth. Our economy is growing, but the port in Lagos was built in 1975. What was our population then? What was our GDP? The best way I will explain it to people is that in 1975, I was 13. So, I am now 58. So, that is 43 years after. So, imagine me at 43 trying to wear the jeans I was wearing when I was 13. It is going to be uncomfortable. That is the discomfort we feel now. Until we have port expansion, it is going to be uncomfortable. That is why you see the government aggressively pushing the Lekki Port. That is what will give relief. The trailers don\u2019t want to park on the bridge. They want to go into the ports. They want to drop cargo or pick up cargo, but there\u2019s a queue because the place is not large enough. The turnaround is not quick enough to process them. Then, unfortunately, the road that used to evacuate the ports -the Apapa-Oworonshki Road \u2013 had collapsed; even going to the port through Oshodi/Mile 2 had collapsed when we came in. Now, the road to evacuate the port is not through the city road. Because that road had collapsed, you see them coming through the city and then, on the bridge. Apapa, through Mile 2, to Tollgate, is quicker for them than to come through Western Avenue. So, they will soon go back to that road because we are working, through another Public Private Partnership arrangement to finish that road. So, you need to understand why. We know that there have been some wear and tear on the bridge. But, there is a contract to rehabilitate them. So, it is a tough turf. Do we close down the ports? Or what do we do? As we do the repairs, the Ministry of Transportation, under Rotimi Amaechi, is now bringing the rail to the ports. So, that is the final solution; not just the expansion of the ports to take the cargo off the road. So, we are heading there.\n\nWhat then is the solution to Lagos-Badagry Expressway, a major economic gateway for Nigeria that is now in shambles because you started the rehabilitation as governor?\n\nAs I\u2019ve told you, we have dozens of projects. I can\u2019t remember everything offhand. And I represent Lagos in the Federal cabinet, but my work is across the whole of the country. So, I disagree with you that Lagos-Badagry is in shambles. This is the point. I think we have to be specific. Lagos-Badagry is about 50 something kilometres. Is it the whole road that is in shambles? That is the point. This is what helps us. If you tell us specifically this is where it pains, it helps us in addressing the point of pain. It is like saying \u2018I have a headache,\u2019 but instead of saying that I have a headache, you are saying the whole body is paining me. How do you get a good treatment? So, I get the point. Yes, you are right. I started that project as governor and we got approval to do it. We have done up to the first 20 kilometres to Okokomaiko. We ran into some difficulty around that area because of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation pipeline. But, I can tell you we have since awarded the remaining sections. We have a contractor there now. The contractor has been there since two years ago. Now, we are facing the same problem. I agree with you it is a very strategic road. That is the Lagos-Abidjan Highway. Actually, it is one of the 12 trans-Saharan African highways. About four of them pass through Nigeria. That is one of them that links Lagos to Abidjan through Ghana through Benin Republic. So, we have awarded the contract now. It is funds challenge first of all. So, we are trying to see if we can move that project into the Sukuk. You see, it is a fallout of so many things at the same time. But the important thing to also note is that people are focused on pavement. But the real problem is the drainage. So, we are constructing the drainage from the Badagry end to town because the character of the road has changed from the 1970s. There were no houses, no shops, no malls at that time. So, right now, the road can\u2019t drain. So, it is just a matter of finance.\n\nAs a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and now a politician, do you see politics through the prism of law?\n\nThere is no aspect of human endeavour that is not regulated by law. I can\u2019t think of anything. There are some things you can\u2019t publish. It can become defamatory of somebody. What you wear is regulated by law. You can\u2019t get up and say that you can\u2019t wear clothes. What you eat is regulated by law. Who you marry is regulated by law. To that extent all the bridges we are talking about are regulated by law. Everything we do. So, why are we complying with COVID-19 protocols? It is because it is a law. So, that mindset helps me in my job. You are building a house, there are specifications on how you mix your cement. It is a law. Even the politics you are talking about is law. You must have a political party. Law is everywhere in human endeavour. Law separates us from animals.\n\nThere is an unwritten agreement between the North and the South with regards to the Presidency. Which region should take it after Buhari?\n\nYou are the one telling me.\n\nThere is an unwritten agreement between the North and South?\n\nYou are the one telling me.\n\nIn your first term, you managed three ministries.

          "text": "\u2022Lawmakers set for showdown this week\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nA new Electoral Act Amendment Bill which provides for total ban of electronic transmission of votes is to be introduced at the Senate next Tuesday.\n\nThe provision forms part of the 121-page document to be laid before the upper legislative chamber at plenary by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabir Gaya.\n\nThe proposed piece of legislation is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to repeal the Electoral Act No 6, 2010 and enact the Electoral Act 2021, to regulate the conduct of Federal, State and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory elections, and for related matters\u201d.\n\nBut this current draft, which is said to be at variance with what was earlier agreed to by the committees of the two chambers of the legislature, THISDAY gathered, might result in a showdown amongst the lawmakers, when the draft is tabled for debate this week.\n\nThis is as the Senate Committee chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya was said to have concluded plans to clear Ms. Laureate Onochie as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nThe bill, which has 153 sections, is divided into eight parts including Establishment and function, etc of INEC, Staff of the Commission, National register of Voters and Voters\u2019 education and procedure at election.\n\nOther parts of the bill are political parties, Electoral Offences, determination of election petitions arising from election petitions and Miscellaneous.\n\nThe draft bill, a copy of which was sighted by THISDAY, allowed for electronic voting by secret ballot but ruled out electronic transmission of the votes cast at the poling units.\n\nThis is contained on Page 25 of the document and subtitled procedure at election under Section 50(2) of bill which states: \u201cVoting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC) which may include electronic voting provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nAccording to section. 50 (2) of the new draft, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting, PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nThe draft bill further stated that, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be by open secret ballot\u201d and that \u201cA voter on receiving a ballot paper shall mark it in the manner prescribed by the Commission.\n\n\u201cAll ballots at an election under this Bill at any polling station shall be deposited in the ballot box in the open view of the public.\n\n\u201cNo voter shall vote for more than one candidate or record more than one vote in favour of any candidate at any one election. (2)Where the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding Officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\n\u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Commission may, if satisfied that the result of the election will not substantially be affected by voting in the area where the election is cancelled, direct that a return of the election be made.\n\n\u201cWhere a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification under this section.\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers\u201d, the draft bill stated.\n\nTHISDAY findings revealed that this clause was sneaked into the draft bill by some leaders of the legislature without the knowledge of the committee members.\n\nA ranking Senator and member of the Senate committee on INEC, upon enquiry, told THISDAY that at no time was that provision discussed at the committee level talk less of inserting it in the draft bill.\n\nThe Senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, he now understood why the delay in presenting the bill after the committee had long concluded its work.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is not funny at all. I now know why the presentation of the report had been delayed this long after we finished our work at the committee level. They have been playing hide and seek on the matter.\n\n\u201cFor all I know and other committee members can bear me witness, the issue of ban on electronic transfer of votes was not part of the report we wrote. So, that means the committee Chairman is culpable and owes the committee members an explanation over the strange insertion\u201d.\n\nThe bill, which has been in the works for some time would be laid before the Senate next Tuesday by Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Gaya.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the bill would then be scheduled for debate on Wednesday with the former governor of Kano State and committee Chairman, Senator Gaya, leading the debate by summarising the provisions of the bill.\n\nHowever, the bill may run into crisis as there are plans by some Senators especially, members of the Senate Committee on INEC to oppose the strange clause included in the draft.\n\nTHISDAY gathered at the weekend that the Senators had already begun to reach out to their colleagues, explaining that they were not part of the inserted clause.\n\nThey have, therefore, pledged to resist the clause banning electronic transmission of votes cast during the general debate of the bill this Wednesday.\n\nIn a related development, despite the protests against the person of Ms Onochie, the source claimed the Senator Gaya-led committee has concluded plans to approve her appointment as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Marafa: Buni\u2019s chairmanship illegal, threatens court action\n\n\u2022Kyari: Matawalle can\u2019t be our leader, Buni lacks power to dissolve EXCO\n\n\u2022PDP says defector gov\u2019s statement confirms APC is behind insecurity\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nLast week\u2019s defection of Governor Bello Matawalle from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) has set off a new leadership struggle in Zamfara States as Senator Kabiru Marafa and former Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari have opposed a directive that the defector governor has automatically become the leader of APC in the state.\n\nSenator Kabir Marafa contended that the APC constitution in section 17(4) forbade Governor Mai Mala Buni from being the chairman of APC.\n\nHe also said he had told President Muhammadu Buhari of the banana peel on the path of Buni as chairman of APC, threatening legal actions for his continued stay in office as APC Chairman.\n\nAccording to Marafa, \u201cYou see, let me tell you something that is likely to happen, as far as I\u2019m concerned. APC should let the sleeping dog lie. Mai Mala Buni, the chairman, doesn\u2019t have the powers under the constitution to make certain pronouncements and that is number one.\n\n\u201cNumber two, issues will come up and we are going to challenge even the legality of his being a chairman of APC. When you look at our APC Constitution, sections 17 sub 4 in particular forbids Mai Mala from being the chairman of the party. I have warned.\n\n\u201cI have alerted Mr President a long time ago that, we should be very wary of these banana peels, because if things are pushed to their limits, there will be consequences. Now when you push a man to the wall, definitely he is going to fight back. So, we are going to ask these fundamental questions, when the need arises to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nSpecifically, Marafa said there was no APC in Zamfara and no governor for the state now.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV network, Marafa, who had earlier taken APC to court, resulting in the disqualification of the party in the 2019 governorship election said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any governor for now,\u201d insisting that Matawalle\u2019s defection violated the 2019 Supreme Court Judgement.\n\nOn his part, Yari too has rejected Mataealle as the leader of APC in the state.\n\nFeaturing on BBC Hausa Service, Yari rejected Buni\u2019s declaration, saying Matawalle was not the leader of the party.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, Yari said; \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that we are challenging which is the declaration by Governor Mai Mala. His declaration was not part of what we discussed with six governors before he (Matawalle) defected.\n\n\u201cWhat we all agreed during our meeting with the six governors was that Matawalle should be received into our fold and afterwards we should discuss how to integrate both his people and ours. But during the defection, we were told that the party executives should be dissolved. You just don\u2019t dissolve executives of a party, because nobody has the power to do so,\u201d Yari said.\n\nCorroborating this, Marafa said the declaration of Matawalle as the leader of the party in the state was tantamount to deception, insisting that they would not accept it.\n\n\u201cWe said for proper integration, there should be a meeting for proper consultations but all of a sudden, announcement was made that the party executives had been dissolved and someone was named as leader of our party. This is incorrect,\u201d he maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has said the claim by Matawalle, that he joined the APC in order to get the federal government to end insecurity in his state, reinforced public\u2019s stance that the APC and its government were responsible for the banditry, terrorism and kidnapping ravaging the state.\n\nAccording to the PDP, stating that now that he has finally joined the APC, he would \u201chave the full backing of the federal government to fight insecurity\u201d, further exposed that the APC was never committed to fighting insecurity but apparently fueling it for political gains.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said, the statement by Governor Matawalle further confirmed that the APC has been promoting insecurity particularly, terrorism and kidnapping for ransom, in various parts of the country as a way to create an emergency situation to cover their atrocities, siphon public funds as well as intimidate and coerce state governors elected on the platform of other political parties to join their fold.\n\nThe PDP recalled how Matawalle had been under pressure by the APC-led federal government with the imposition of no flight as well as threats of state of emergency in the state.\n\n\u201cNigerians now know those behind the violent abductions, kidnapping and other acts of terrorism in the state and other parts of the country as well as why the situation has continued to escalate under the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed atrocious and most unpardonable that the APC is using the blood of innocent and helpless Nigerians for its political gains as well as to create a gory merchandise for its leaders and cronies,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP held that by this claim, it was clear that Matawalle did not defect to the APC, because the party has any democratic credential as erroneously claimed by the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, but only surrendered to intimidation and cowardly joined those behind the killings and acts of violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOf course, the APC as a party of political bandits, does not have any democratic credential to attract well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle must, however, note that joining such individuals, who have brought so much anguish and pain to his people, is an unpardonable act of betrayal which will continue to act as an albatross particularly, against the backdrop of his own vows,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nOn the reclaiming of the governorship mandate, the PDP described Matawalle\u2019s boast as the feeble kick of a disoriented and confused deserter, stressing that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is clear on the responsibilities of a deputy governor that finds himself under an absconding governor like Matawalle.\n\nIn Delta State, a former governorship aspirant of the PDP, Chief Sunny Onuesoke said yesterday that defection was no solution to the myriads of problems confronting the nation at the moment.\n\nOnuesoke, who spoke while reacting to the series of defections across party lines by political office holders said those doing so with prevailing social and security problems across the country were callous and wicked.\n\n\u201cDefection is no solution to the myriads of problems facing the country at the moment, Nigerians are hungry. For the past five, six years, Nigerians have been subjected to untold hardship and hunger due to the incompetent handling of governance by those entrusted with such responsibilities, instead of increase in living standard, Nigerians are experiencing massive decrease, Prices of basic commodities have shot astronomically high from what was obtainable in the past.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of job losses with firms either downsizing or folding up completely. Nigerians cannot sleep with their two eyes closed due to insecurity occasioned by the activities of marauding killer herdsmen, bandit and kidnappers, which is currently ravaging every facet of our national life.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking for ways to salvage the situation, politicians from both the ruling party APC and the opposition PDP are busy crisscrossing between political parties like political prostitutes\u201d Onuesoke stated.\n\nThe former governorship aspirant called on politicians to wake up and face the reality of tackling the problems facing the country instead of pursuing their selfish and personal interest.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says govt must be sincere in handling the issues\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nA former leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), Chief Government Ekpemupolo otherwise known as Tompolo, has warned the federal government over palpable tension and fear in the region, following the inability of the government to constitute a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nTompolo, who has continued to appeal to the agitators and stakeholders in the region to sustain the existing peace in the region, said it was important for the federal government to quickly accede to their request as well as handle issues of development in the region with sincerity.\n\nTompolo, the Ibe-Ebidouwei of Ijaw Nation, who made the appeal on Friday night in a statement he personally signed, however, accused multinational oil companies of conspiracies with the federal government.\n\nThe Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, had promised stakeholders and agitators in the region that President Muhammadu Buhari would inaugurate a new board for the interventionist agency in June.\n\nThe promise by Akpabio on behalf of the federal government was not kept as at June ending thereby fueling tension in the now relatively peaceful Niger Delta region.\n\nHowever, in spite of government\u2019s failure, Tompolo appealed to the people of the region to exercise patience, adding that the people of the region must avoid a renewed crisis.\n\nHe lamented that the people of the region were suffering as a result of government\u2019s failure to cater tothe welfare of her citizens, noting that the situation was not different in other parts of the country,where government had also failed them.\n\nThe Gbaramatu-born chief, in the statement titled: \u201cNiger Delta Agitators\u2019 Ultimatum to the Federal Government of Nigeria: A Call for Restrain\u201d reiterated his call for the urgent constitution of the board of the commission to arrest looming crisis in the region.\n\nHe noted that since the expiration of his ultimatum, he had been in constant touch with agitators and relevant stakeholders in the region on the need to keep the existing peace in the oil-rich region.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient that I speak on the above subject matter. It could be recalled that I issued ultimatum to the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari to do the needful on the issue of the NDDC board by constituting the substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as an urgent matter of public importance and interest to avoid a breakdown of law and order in the region, sometime ago.\n\n\u201cMy ultimatum led to a consultative meeting between major stakeholders from the region and Senator Godswill Akpabio in Oporoza town, where a truce was reached, as the Minister profusely pleaded that he should be allowed to start and fast-track the process of constituting the board within the month of June, 2021.\n\n\u201cJune 2021 has come to an end. The people of the region are yet to see any tangible move towards the constitution of the NDDC board by the federal government. The people are seriously agitated. There is palpable fear and tension in the region.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate my earlier position that, the government should as a matter of urgency, constitute the substantive board of the NDDC to avoid unnecessary bickering and crisis in the region.\n\n\u201cSince I reluctantly accepted the outcome of the consultative meeting, I have done so much to keep peace in the region which some major stakeholders in the security circle are aware of.\n\n\u201cI have been in constant touch with my fellow agitators in the region to give peace a chance, knowing full well that there cannot be any meaningful development in an atmosphere of rancor and acrimony.\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, the one thing the government must do in this issue is to be courageous enough to constitute the NDDC board. Government must be sincere in handling developmental issues in the Niger Delta region as the people have suffered enough, being neglected for several decades.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is so much bitterness in the land owing to the lackadaisical attitude of this government in handling matters of great importance to its citizens,\u201d Tompolo said.\n\nWhile prevailing on his colleagues to maintain the prevailing peace in the region, Tompolo declared:\u201cAs for my follow agitators, please permit me to borrow the biblical words of Jesus Christ, that we should be wise as serpent and gentle as dove to continue our agitation for a better living for our people.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid anything that may throw the only relatively peaceful region in the country now into chaos, because of government\u2019s nonchalant attitude towards the security and welfare of its citizenry as constitutionally provided.\n\n\u201cThe average Nigerian citizen is a government of his or her own as the citizens provide everything for themselves today. The government is unfair to a greater number of its citizens. The Nigerian Government must create an enabling environment for the citizens to live a prosperous and peaceful life.\u201d\n\nThe former MEND leader further accused multinational oil companies operating in the region of alleged conspiracy to further impoverished the people of oil-bearing communities by not performing their obligation to their hosts.\n\n\u201cMultinational oil companies operating in the Niger delta region are not left out in the troubles of the region. They are clearly part of the conspiracy in the marginalisation of the region. They must perform their statutory obligations to the people of the region by promptly delivering cooperate social responsivities to the people.\n\n\u201cMost of the companies are operating under the cover of the Nigerian Military, which has further exacerbated the relationship between Multinationals and their host communities. They must do their business in a most friendly atmosphere, and not to set neighbouring host communities against one another\u201d, Tompolo wrote in the statement.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Segun James\n\nThe scheduled Lagos mega rally by Yoruba nation agitators turned bloody yesterday as a 14-year-old girl was killed, apparently, by stray bullet from the Nigeria Police.\n\nThe rally could not hold on a large scale as planned because of heavy police presence at the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, a situation that led to a confrontation between the agitators and security agents.\n\nThe rally was planned by Yoruba activist, Mr. Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. But barely 24 hours before it was due to commence, the police denied the planners a permit. The police claimed the timing of the rally was wrong, as the state was still in pains following the huge destruction suffered during the last #EndSARS protests.\n\nThe girl, a yoghurt seller simply identified as Jumoke, was said to be running following gunshots by the police to disperse the protesters, when she was hit by stray bullet from the back. It was gathered that the girl was not part of the protest and efforts to speak to a man, who said he was the father of the girl, failed, as he declined speaking to the press.\n\nThe State Police Command is yet to react to the development.\n\nThe Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, did not come to the rally due to the refusal of the police to grant the marchers a permit.\n\nDespite the unfavourable disposition of the Nigeria Police to the agitation for Oduduwa Republic, protesters in Lagos and others from outside the state were able to gather at Ojota for the rally, dressed in traditional attires, with some decorated with charms. They voiced their position and declared they were tired of the Nigerian union.\n\nThe protesters, who initially appeared to be nowhere near the venue of the rally, Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, suddenly started gathering close to the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, as he addressed newsmen on reasons the state government was opposed to the rally.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that policemen and soldiers were drafted to the venue of the rally since Friday night, and there was reinforcement Saturday morning. Over 25 trucks belonging to the Nigeria Police, Nigerian Army, and members of the Lagos State security outfit, Rapid Response Service (RRS) were seen stationed at the park and around it.\n\nPolicemen and soldiers stood at strategic positions, cuddling their guns as the service lane from Ketu to Ojota was cordoned off to prevent people coming close to the venue.\n\nAt Berger Bus Stop, policemen embarked on a stop and search exercise, even as operatives of the joint military patrol, Operation MESA, were drafted to patrol Berger, Ojota, Maryland, Ikeja and parts of Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, an exercise that created a heavy gridlock on the road.\n\nSome of the protesters, who spoke with newsmen, complained about the high level of insecurity and injustice in the country, saying they are tired and ready to leave Nigeria for Oduduwa Republic.\n\nOne of the agitators, Mr. Taiwo Abiodun Obanla, who rolled on the ground in frustration as he spoke, said, \u201cWe are not going home, we want Yoruba Nation, we are no more Nigerians. We don\u2019t want Nigeria, we are suffering, we don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nA leader of the rally, simply identified as Opeoluwa, who led a group of Osun worshippers to the march, was seen approaching some police officers at the venue with a letter to the Inspector-General, Baba Alkali, as he appealed to them to cooperate with the protesters and let them hold their peaceful rally. Opeoluwa said the protesters were men and women of peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have a letter for the IG. We don\u2019t have anything against the police, we don\u2019t have anything against the army, we don\u2019t have anything against the security agencies. We want you to protect us.\n\n\u201cWe want to hold a peaceful rally. We are for peace; we are men and women of peace. Please, cooperate with us; we are not here to fight you.\u201d\n\nPolice used water cannons and fired gunshots to try to disperse the protesters.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says bandits plotting to kidnap his children\n\n\u2022Insists they will not get a penny from the state, they will get bullets instead\n\n\u2022Seven killed in Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa LGAs\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has declared that the military must launch a grand offensive against armed bandits in the North-west in order to free the region of the scourge of kidnapping perpetrated by bandits.\n\nHe said though the military had sustained the decimation of the criminal elements using air strikes and ground troops, insufficient attack aircraft and troops had derailed a final clearance operation.\n\nThis is coming as the Kaduna State chief security officer raised the alarm that bandits were planning to attack his children\u2019s school and kidnap them.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Service (BBC), el-Rufai said a military-led offensive must be initiated to eliminate once and for all bandits operating in North-west forests.\n\n\u201cWe must kill all the bandits who must go to the forest and carpet bomb and kill everyone there. This has been our position for the past two years. I\u2019m happy to say that this is being done, not in the coordinated manner that I wanted, because I wanted this to happen at the same time in all seven states of the North-west.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough planes. We don\u2019t have enough soldiers. We don\u2019t have enough to do this simultaneously. So it\u2019s been done gradually, but there has been a lot of degradation of the bandits\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI assure you we are killing them. We are wiping out their camps, and the military and the the the air force particularly and the Nigerian army with special forces have been doing a great job.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t know how many attempted kidnaps we have foiled many people don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t talk about it. They only know the ones that have succeeded\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State chief executive has withdrawn his children from Kaduna Capital School following security reports of a plot by bandits to attack the school and kidnap his children.\n\nHe told BBC that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also noted would expose other children to danger.\n\nThe governor, had, in a bid to revamp public education in the state enrolled two of his children, Abubakar Sadiq and his younger sister, Nasrine.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the children, who had taken to home study, were withdrawn from school following security reports made available to him.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai said the state government had maintained its position against payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nThe governor had disclosed in an earlier media interview that the plot to abduct his children was designed to see if he would not pay ransom.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals.\n\n\u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna. Anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nSeven killed in Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa LGAs\n\nIn a related development yesterday, armed bandits reportedly killed seven persons within the last 72 hours in Chikun, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas of Kaduna State, an official of the state said last night\n\nAccording to him, the developments were reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies on yesterday.\n\nThe source said the bandits shot four kidnapped citizens at the outskirts of Tsohon Gayan general area of Chikun LGA.\n\n\u201cTwo were identified as Solomon Bamaiyi and Francis Moses from Kakau village of the same LGA. The third was identified as being from Kachia town and the fourth remains unidentified.\n\n\u201cIn I Station, Kajuru LGA, two citizens, Reuben Tanko and Sani Jibrin were also shot dead by a group of armed bandits.\n\n\u201cOne Danjuma Alhaji, a native of Tsohon Farakwai of Igabi LGA was similarly killed by bandits at the outskirts of Galadima general area of Giwa LGA\u201d, he added.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai was said to have sent condolences to their families and prayed for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security agencies have carried out confidence building visit to Iri Station, where some citizens were killed and an unspecified number kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who led the delegation assured the community of government\u2019s commitment to the security and peace of the general area\u201d, the official explained.\n\nHe also said that collaboration between communities and security agencies is critical and must be cultivated towards enhancing security in areas that are difficult to access across the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, has announced the expansion of its services to Uganda. Having established its presence in the Kenyan market, where it claims to serve over one million customers, the startup has its sights on Uganda\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nCopia Global operates a different model from most eCommerce platforms. Rather than depending on a website, it uses a network of agents spread across the country. When customers need an item, they visit an agent with a digital device to place their order.\n\nAfter placing their order, the agent sends it to Copia Global, who processes and delivers it within two days when the customer returns to pick it up. By adopting this model, the company can serve people who do not own digital devices or cannot access the Internet. Interestingly, it does all this using USSD technology.\n\nWhile the startup has a website, it is mainly for customers who live in urban areas. This way, they can order goods and have them delivered to people living in rural communities where Copia Global has agents.\n\nThis model is perfect for Uganda, where despite 47% of the population owning mobile subscriptions, only 12 million Ugandans use the Internet. However, its combination of an online and offline model is not exactly novel. In 2019, eCommerce giant, Jumia, partnered with Vivo Energy to use its service stations as pick-up and drop-off points for customers.\n\nAccording to Founder and Chairman, Tracey Turner, \u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hardworking population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the startup has raised $53 million in funding from investors, including LGT Lightstone, Endeavor Catalyst, and Goodwell Investments.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have primarily struggled to show a viable market for their services, with Konga sold in 2018 and Jumia\u2019s business struggling despite listing on the New York Stock Exchange. While models like Copia Global\u2019s that seek to serve low-income consumers might seem like the way to go, eCommerce startups need to serve a larger market to make as much revenue as the giants do.",

The co-founder says it is to \u201cmake history and appeal to Islamic investors to participate in the issuance.\u201d\n\nOne company, several partners\n\nIn describing OWS\u2019s business model, Adeojo says it\u2019s like Uber, but for energy services.\n\n\u201cWe partner with a lot of solar companies across the continent that carry out installation and maintenance. What we do is to provide the hardware like, solar panels, inverters, and software to enable the hardware run seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are some of the software used by OWS to facilitate services like payments and monitoring.\n\nBreaking down the process of how OWS operates, Adeojo says there are brokers that source for clients and solar companies that install hardware.\n\nThrough this model he claims, the company creates jobs for young engineers.\n\nSupervised by the solar companies, these engineers can also be part of the installation process individually. In addition, they\u2019ll also be in charge of maintenance, meaning they\u2019ll keep earning as long as the installed hardware is in use.\n\nThe vision of the renewable energy company is to deploy 14,000 megawatts of off-grid renewable energy across sub-Saharan Africa to decarbonise the region\u2019s energy sector.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN) Fact Sheet on Climate Change, \u201cAfrica is the continent\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\u201d with 0.8 metric tons of carbon emissions per capita in the year 2000.\n\nHowever, Adeojo says OWS has partnered with solar companies and installers to deploy over 50 megawatts of renewable energy across Nigeria.\n\nWith this issuance, the company can accelerate its vision of installing 14,000 megawatts of clean energy in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time an African startup has resorted to bonds for funding, it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon.

          "text": "As the pace of innovation in the African tech ecosystem ramps up, more attention would be given \u2014 and for a good reason \u2014 to the brave founders and innovators building Africa\u2019s future. However, angel investors and venture capitalists are a similarly courageous group of individuals who are seldom celebrated.\n\nTwice a month, we speak with an angel investor or venture capitalist backing Africa\u2019s innovators to draw insights from them. For this week\u2019s edition, I talked to Stewart Glynn, a Partner at TEN13, an Australian venture capital firm.\n\nGlynn grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital and most populous city, in an entrepreneurial family. When it was time for university, he went to Australia to gain a degree in business, banking, and finance at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nAfter that, he worked with General Electric and KPMG. During this time, he did a lot of work around helping businesses develop sustainable structures and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis time in the corporate sector exposed him to technology and its disruptive effects in various industries. He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "text": "Railway Project: Lagos to divert traffic at Brewery, Ijora from Sunday, July 4th\n\nThe Lagos State Government has announced the diversion of traffic flow at Brewery and Ijora Level Crossings for the railway modernisation project from Sunday, July 4 to August 1.\n\nThe construction is in line with the Nigerian railway modernisation project, Lagos-Ibadan section, with an extension to Lagos Port at Apapa.\n\nAccording to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), this is contained in a statement issued by the Lagos State commissioner for transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, on Friday, July 2, 2021, in Lagos.\n\nOladeinde revealed that the construction company, China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) Nigeria Ltd. would commence asphalt and drainage works on the first lane from July 4 to July 18 and then afterwards, proceed to the second lane from July 18 to August. 1.\n\nHe said, \u201ca counter flow will be created on the lane that is free when rehabilitation works are ongoing on the other to enable motorists to ply the route and reach their various destinations without much difficulty. We urge road users to comply with the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) to minimise inconveniences that may be experienced while the construction lasts.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead Also: Pulling down the railway tracks\n\nThe Lagos State government had recently temporarily closed some roads for construction work as part of the Nigerian Railway Modernisation project. Some of the roads earlier closed include those at Agege, Iganmu, Apapa dockyard, Ilupeju and so on.\n\nFG to fine passenger airlines $3,500 for not complying with new COVID-19 protocols from the coming week\n\nThe Federal Government is set to fine airlines the sum of $3,500 per passenger or ban them from flying in Nigeria if they fail to comply with its new COVID-19 pre-boarding requirements.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee, (PSC), Boss Mustapha, on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the pre-boarding requirements, according to PSC, is that incoming passengers must now perform a COVID-19, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test three days before boarding.\n\nMustapha said, \u201cThe test detects the presence of a virus if you are infected at the time of the test. The test could also detect fragments of the virus even after you are no longer infected. This is part of the new reviewed travel restrictions in the country. Passengers must perform a COVID-19 PCR test not more than three days (72 hours) before boarding. The PCR test done more than 72 hours before departure is not valid and the person will not be allowed to board. Rapid antigen or antibody tests are not acceptable; only PCR tests can be used for this purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cTest validity commences from the time of sample collection. For passengers with multiple connections before arrival in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, passengers must bring along an electronic or hard copy of their COVID-19 PCR test for presentation at the departure airport and upon arrival in Nigeria. The PSC chairman also said that foreigners without a PCR test would be deported.\n\n\u201cPassengers who are Nigerians or holders of a permanent residence permit will be allowed entry. However, passengers, who visited Turkey, Brazil, India, South Africa within 14 days, will be denied entry into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Again, Emirates bans Nigeria flights, extends South Africa route suspension\n\nRead Also: Nigerians bypass Dubai ban, travel through Ghana\n\nOPEC\u2019s last-minute brawl halts oil price rally while COVID-19 Delta variant supports gold prices\n\nThe black liquid hydrocarbon drifted slightly lower in London at the last trading session of the week after recent fundamentals reveal the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) are not all on the same table regarding output levels, amid surging global demand.\n\nOil prices fell 2% to a one-week low on Monday after hitting their highest since 2018, as a spike in COVID-19 cases in Asia and Europe put a break on the rally before OPEC+ Meeting.\n\nPrices on Wednesday extended the previous day\u2019s small gains after an industry report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week, overriding trader and investor concerns about transportation curbs in some countries as COVID-19 cases surge. On Thursday, oil prices rose roughly 2% on indications that OPEC+ producers could increase output more slowly than expected in the coming months while rising global fuel demand causes supply to tighten.\n\nPrices inched lower on Friday after OPEC+ ministers delayed a meeting on output policy as the United Arab Emirates baulked at a plan to add back 2 million barrels per day (BPD) in the second half of the year. Brent had a weekly growth of 0.04%.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian states in more trouble as oil prices rise\n\nGold appreciated by 0.17% while Silver also inched up by 1.27% W-o-W\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be mixed as OPEC+ seeks agreement on oil output policy after initial talks end in disarray. The spread of the Delta variant is likely to pare gains in the near term.\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, as the dollar strengthens, and while the spread of the Delta variant is expected to support gold as it can delay economic recovery.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThe currency market was bearish this week at the bureau de change (BDC) market while it appreciated slightly at the official window.\n\nIt depreciated against the US dollar by +1.01%, appreciated against the British Pound by -0.56% while it remained flat against the Euro on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira appreciated week-on-week by +0.10% and +0.14% at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.25 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N410.42.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nMoney market rates continued their double-digits trend last week, however, on a W-o-W basis, both overnight rates and open buyback fell significantly.\n\nAt the close of the trading session last week, funding rates fell. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 12.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 12.50% indicating a W-o-W decline of -45.45% for OBB and -45.65% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to continue their double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury bills\n\nThe Treasury Bills Market started the previous week on a bullish note, with the average benchmark falling by 38bps. Although the bullish sentiment was not maintained throughout the week.\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills fell by -4.71% to 6.58% while OMO bills rose marginally by +1.87% W-o-W to close at 9.92%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by -2.46%.\n\nThe CBN sold N163.61 billion worth of notes against N81.72 billion offered at its NTB auction this week. The 91-day, 182-day & 364-day notes were allotted at 2.50%, 3.50%, & 9.15% respectively. Compared to the previous auction, rates on the 91-day & 182-day were unchanged while the 364-day paper fell slightly by 25bps.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN and Euro bonds market\n\nThe Bond market opened in a relatively bullish trend at the start of the week as demand was seen across the board and continued for most of the trading session in the week.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with buying interest seen across the board.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.62% for the week which fell W-o-W by -2.17%.\n\nThe relatively weak trend in the Eurobond market persisted last week, as renewed covid-19 concerns coupled with the rising US inflation, continue to dampen demand across the board.\n\nThe relatively weak trend in the Eurobond market persisted last week, as renewed covid-19 concerns coupled with the rising US inflation, continue to dampen demand across the board.\n\nWe expect market sentiment to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the previous week on a positive note inching up by +1.47%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N292.39bn thus, year-to-date return moderated to -5.11%.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was significantly bullish last week as the NSE Consumer Goods was the highest gainer for the week with +5.15% while NSE-Oil and Gas recorded the highest decline with -1.05%. NSE-IND, NSE Pension, NSE-30 and, NSE Banking closed the week positive with +2.10%, +1.88%, +1.89%, and +1.34% respectively.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains, however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nThe Nigeria economy in retrospect\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning disclosed on Thursday at the presentation of the draft for the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper that the Federal Government had spent 92.7 % of the prorated budget, which amounts to N4.8tn. Of which, N1.8tn an equivalent of 37.5%was released for debt servicing, while N1.5tn (31.25%) was spent on personnel cost, and N973.13bn (20.2%) was spent on capital projects. Also at the event, the minister disclosed that the government would spend up to N900bn on petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission have disclosed that it would soon commence the review of the allocation formula applicable to the revenue retained in the Federation Account.\n\nThe review would begin with the vertical sharing formula which shows the proportion of revenues allocated to the three tiers of government. This will be followed by the horizontal formula which addresses sharing among states and local governments. An official of the commission concluded that whatsoever the commission fixes are final and cannot be surpassed.\n\nAccording to data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), banks\u2019 credit to Nigeria\u2019s private sector increased by +4% (N1.29 trillion) in Q1 2021 to reach N31.44 trillion in Q1 2021. This is coming on the back of the bank\u2019s continued effort to encourage lending to the real sector to stimulate Nigeria\u2019s economic growth. Meanwhile, credit advanced to the public sector reduced by N410.7 billion in the review period. A further breakdown of the figures reveals that while total credit to the economy rose by+2% (N880.65 billion) in Q1 2021, from N42.55 trillion as of December 2020 to N43.44 trillion at the end of Q1 2021. Meanwhile, credit allocation to the government declined by -3% (N410.62 billion) from N12.4 trillion to N11.99 trillion.\n\nThe federal government stated in the week that electricity subsidy has been reduced by N20bn per month. This is following record-high tariff collections of N65bn in the December 2020 cycle up from an average of N39bn).\n\nThe Minister of Power, however, stated that the Federal Government still paid over N50bn monthly to subsidise electricity supply in the country. You would recall that the International Monetary Fund had in its \u2018Resilience through reform\u2019 report expressed concern over the subsidies in Nigeria.\n\nGroup managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, disclosed on Tuesday that the price of petrol should be more than N280/litre which is the price of Automotive Gas Oil(diesel). PMS which unlike diesel is subsidized by the government currently sells for N162/litre. According to the NNPC Group Managing Director, AGO (diesel) should normally sell for above the price of PMS.\n\nThe National Pension Commission PenCom announced on Wednesday that the Federal Government has approved payment of outstanding accrued pension rights for verified and enrolled retirees of treasury-funded MDAs that retired but are yet to be paid their retirement benefits, as well as the backlog of death benefits claims due to beneficiaries of deceased employees of treasury funded MDAs.\n\nIn keeping with the Pensions Reform Act (2014), the Federal Government is required to contribute the payment of the 10% rate as an employer under a pension contribution for its employees, while the employees contribute 8%).\n\nOn Monday, the landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit being imported into Nigeria surged by more than 60 percent between December 2020 and mid-June this year. From an average of N143.60 per litre in December, the landing cost of petrol rose to N231.98 per litre on June 16 this year on the back of the rally in global oil prices and the depreciation of the naira against the dollar.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of Automotive Gas Oil, also known as diesel, jumped to N280 per litre amid the recent increase in global prices and naira devaluation.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday passed the Petroleum Industry Bill and approved that three percent of the profit made by oil firms should be shared to host communities. The Senate also approved that 30 percent of profits accruing from oil and gas operations by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation would be set aside for exploration of oil in the frontier basin.\n\nFiscal authorities have, despite dwindling earnings, maintained an aggressive posture. The government is making disbursements under the Special Public Works Programme and has recently announced its plan to expend $1bn on the construction of 3 major highways in the country, all to reflate the economy.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at 33%, analysts are concerned about whether or not jobs would be growth elastic, especially as job creation is the medium through which growth impacts households and individuals. Similarly, there are concerns about the discounting effect associated inflation could have on purchasing power.\n\nOn the monetary side, the CBN in collaboration with RIFAN recently sought to reduce the food price level by supplying 27,000metric tons of paddy rice to millers across the country. There have been fears that food prices were, in the month, on the rise with increases recorded in the prices of staples, spices, and condiments. The MPC would consider the next inflation figures for June 2021 to determine whether MPR should be raised when it meets in July.\n\nIn the external sector, we have continued to see net imports rise as well as a reduction in government earnings amidst OPEC production cuts. This critically constrains CBN\u2019s capacity to defend the Naira against the Dollar in the long term.\n\nOn the global scene, stimulus packages have continued to boost recovery although the Delta variant of the COVID-19 infection has now been reported in 85 countries. Full economic recovery, therefore, depends on whether the positive sentiments and improved consumer confidence earlier seen are sustained.\n\nEdited by Stephen Onyekwelu",

          "title": "Senate in credibility question over wishy-washy probes",
          "text": "At the inauguration of the 9th Assembly, Ahmed Lawan, the Senate president, made promises to Nigerians, part of which was to make the upper chamber to be more responsive to Nigerians they represent and make the Senate function better.\n\nLawan had said the 9th Assembly would be different and characterised by fewer controversies and more positivity.\n\nHowever, the reverse appears to be the case in the last two years he has been in office. The general belief among observers is that the Lawan-led Senate has not done well in this regard.\n\nPresently, public confidence in probes by the Senate is at its lowest ebb. There is the perception among Nigerians that perhaps, the committees\u2019 findings or reports are compromised and hidden from public knowledge by the leadership of the Senate.\n\nRead Also: PIB: Host Communities Trust Fund divides Senate\n\nTo be clear, parliamentary probes are not prosecutorial in nature but expository. They expose things that prosecuting agencies should use. It is said that its probes are to make better laws.\n\nBut then, when a probe is not conclusive and the criminals are shielded, it becomes difficult for prosecuting agencies to set in motion necessary machinery to prosecute.\n\nFor example, last year, the Senate and House of Representatives set up a committee to investigate how the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) allegedly squandered N40 billion within three months.\n\nMoreover, Nigerians witnessed drama over the probe of the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) on fraud, even Kemebradikumo Pondei, the acting MD, brought comic relief to the probe when he collapsed during the probe. There were allegations by Joy Nunieh against Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta, as well as Akpabio\u2019s counter allegation against the Senate.\n\nThe Senate set up an ad-hoc committee presided over by Senator Olubunmi Adetunbi (APC, Ekiti North) to look into financial transactions carried out by the IMC on behalf of the commission within the period and to present a report in four weeks.\n\nThe Committee had asked the then IMC of NDDC to refund N4.923 billion alleged illegal payments made to staff of the commission and contractors in breach of the procurement process.\n\nThe committee became necessary following complaints and a motion sponsored by Senator Thompson George Sekibo (PDP, Rivers East a motion about urgent need to investigate financial restlessness in the NDDC.\n\nThe IMC had also been accused by stakeholders and public interest groups of allegedly laying off of personnel and their replacement with unqualified and inexperienced persons.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that more than a year after the Senate committee had been set up, nothing tangible had been achieved.\n\nObservers decry that the fund has not been remitted to the NDDC account, rather more stealing is said to be going on there despite the forensic exercise going on.\n\nAnother of such cases is the special job slots allegedly shared to Senators by different agencies and MDAs in December 2019. The issue generated discussion and controversy among Nigerians across the country at that time.\n\nThe indicted Senators, including Lawan, had publicly denied the allegation.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Federal Character and Intergovernmental Affairs was tasked to investigate the case by grilling the indicted agencies. The chairman of the panel, Danjuma La\u2019ah, had promised to expose all those who had been involved in the scandal.\n\nInterestingly, for more than a year and half, there have been no reports, nor notice of extension of the committee time. The issue appears to have died a natural death in the upper chamber.\n\nThe issue had continued to generate debates among Nigerians, with many questioning the leadership of the Senate, while others said it was a general reflection of the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nThis year alone, and in the first half of 2021, the Senate has probed over 20 fraud-related cases with majority of them inconclusive, dragging towards the end of the year and likely going to end with little reprimand of the culprits.\n\nToday, politicians, government officials, public servants and corporate executives who embezzle funds are not scared of appearing before a Senate probe panel as many of such probes have amounted to nothing.\n\nIn April 2021, Umar Danladi, chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), assaulted Clement Sagwak, a security guard, at Banex Plaza in Wuse, Abuja. The assault, which was captured by camera, went viral the same day.\n\nDespite the efforts and petition brought to the Senate by Senator Istifanus Dung Gyang, from Plateau North, where the security guard hails from, the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions led by Senator Ayo Akinyelure is still expecting reports on the simple case it should have trashed immediately.\n\nAlso, in June, the Senate Public Accounts Committee began a probe of Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, Akwa Ibom State for alleged illegal diversion of N1.05 billion.\n\nThe Senator Mathew Urhoghide-led panel said the move was premised on two queries by the Office of Auditor-General of the Federation which reportedly exposed the unauthorised withdrawals in its 2018 audited report.\n\nThe document indicated that the N457 million released to the academy on December 13, 2012 was diverted, while N608 million was irregularly withdrawn without concrete.\n\nBut the probe committee demanded details of the case from Duja Effedua, the rector of the academy, who accused his officials of frustrating the investigation.\n\nFor Imohimi Onogie, an Abuja-based criminal expert and law lecturer, the Senate probes have not been effective because they often give culprits opportunity for unnecessary defence.\n\nCiting the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron\u2019s alleged illegal diversion of N1.05 billion, Onogie said that the committees always give culprits opportunity for unnecessary defence.\n\n\u201cImagine, the Senate committee on the Oron probe asking the rector to go and bring details. The fact that the rector and others parties appeared before the probe panel with little details make them culpable. What other evidence are they looking for, because sending them back means the case will delay and offer room for money to change hands and case possibly quashed for lack of evidence\u201d, Onogie said.\n\nThe case, according to the lawyer, will die a natural death or linger till the 10th Senate.\n\nIn his argument, Mathias Obikali, a Port Harcourt based public affair analyst, noted that the rector of the academy cannot say he cannot kick-start something he does not have any information about, because the Office of Auditor-General of the Federation have already indicted him in its report and petition sent the senate.\n\nConsidering the unperturbed attitude of most alleged culprits, he decried that appearing in senate probe committees nowadays does not scare anyone again because of the little or no result from the probes.\n\n\u201cIf the probe committee speeds its investigation process, acquit the innocent, recover stolen wealth, jail culprits and make laws prohibiting any culprit from holding public and political offices, Nigerians will sit-up. But the Senate will not because its members are often involved or may have been compromised,\u201d Obikali said.\n\nOf course, due to weak institutions, corruption is thriving and public funds are being stolen every day, implying more probes for the Senate committees.\n\nSome of the ongoing probes include; the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) for alleged N61.1 billion diversion, probe of N1.8 trillion intervention fund in power sector, investigation of $30 billion alleged revenue leakage from payments on account of foreign currency denominated contracts by companies, to name a few.\n\n\u201cFor lack of the right word, I think the Senate is like a toothless bulldog, if not why are people still stealing public fund, the senate can even influence the EFCC to stop its investigations if it goes contrary to their interest,\u201d Nathan Onyeche, another lawyer, said.\n\nHis thought is captured in Gabriel Suswam\u2019s outcry during one of his committee\u2019s probe on the power sector.\n\n\u201cYou know that the federal government has over the years intervened at various times in different sums: N701 billion, N600 billion and this year there has been N380 billion and N213 billion.\n\n\u201cAll of these monies were federal government interventions in the power sector with the intention and hope that the power sector will become efficient and Nigerians will have access to electricity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in spite of these huge amounts of monies that have been expended, the result in what we see today is that the performance is below expectations,\u201d Suswam, chairman, Senate Committee on Power, lamented.\n\nBut the irony for Onyeche is that despite the lack of accountability and evident embezzling of the power sector funds, the government kept allocating more, while the Senate kept probing.\n\n\u201cWho is fooling who; the one who allocates, the looter or the probing Senate? The probes are not working, and even the EFCC hunts have not been able to stop public funds from being embezzled even in Buhari\u2019s corruption-fighting administration\u201d, Onyeche said.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a public affairs analyst, strongly believes that nothing good would come from the Senate because they were controlled by the executive who put them there.\n\nHe stressed that the action of the leadership of the Senate was a clear demonstration of the soft approach by the Buhari\u2019s administration to corruption despite his campaign on anti-graft war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly of today is being remote-controlled by the Buhari administration, and the much-talked about anti-corruption is nothing but a gimmick to hoodwink the opposition. Since Buhari came to power, how many people have you seen him prosecute, apart from the opposition that keeps defecting from PDP to his party?\n\n\u201cRecall that Adams Oshiomhole once said that if you are in PDP and another party, once you cross to the APC all your sins would be forgiven. A Senator from Delta, Peter Nwaobosi, who has been accused of several contract padding and refusal to execute the awarded contracts, recently jumped from the hammer of prosecution by crossing to the APC.\n\n\u201cThere are so many examples to this effect, but the National Assembly would be sitting and debating over nothing, despite the huge resources at their disposal. We are only hoping that Nigerians will wake up in 2023, and elect a government that can serve them without lies, oppression or vendetta, like we are currently witnessing.\u201d\n\nSeun Lawal, political analyst, said he was not surprised by the turn of events by the Lawan-led Senate, adding that the way the leadership was elected shows they would fail.\n\n\u201cFor me, I am not surprised with what is happening there, you can see the way Lawan was chosen by Buhari; so, he could protect him because the 8th Senate gave him a tough time. The failure of the committees shows they are not accountable to Nigerians who they are representing.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is one of the worst since 1999; how many bills have they passed in the two years they have been there? That should tell you where this administration is going,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nToday, a lot of people are not taking invitation by the Senate as a serious matter, because they know it is an exercise in futility and just to fulfill all righteousness.\n\nA few months ago, envoys and oil companies\u2019 managing directors shunned Senate invitation, and considered it a sheer waste of their time.\n\nIn April this year, the Senate Committee on Local Contents had invited managing directors of oil companies to investigative hearing. The representatives they sent could not give reason for their absence.\n\nIt has also come to a point that people would go to the Senate not prepared to face thorough scrutiny, because they knew from the word go that nothing serious would come out of the exercise. They may just flippantly make some statements, which they would later deny. This can only happen in Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly where things are done in a wishy-washy manner.\n\nWith the seeming weak handling of probe cases, the Senate appears to lack the credibility, and seems also to have lost the trust of many Nigerians to ensure accountability, encourage development through meaningful probes and make appropriate legislation to check the humongous corruption going on in the system.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 As work progresses on the Benin River Port project, the Edo State Government, at the weekend, met with over 15 host communities and other stakeholders, to strengthen ties and build stronger relationships ahead of the completion of the project.\n\nChairman of the Benin River Port Project, Engr. Greg Ogbeifun, who spoke at an engagement session with stakeholders in Benin City, said the port is a legacy project of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, designed to key into the federal government\u2019s initiative of diversifying the economy away from oil, into agriculture and agro-allied business.\n\nOgbeifun, who disclosed that the governor has approved the engagement of CPCS Transaction, a consortium of specialist firms from Canada, Belgium and Nigeria, for the provision of Transaction Advisory Services on the project, said the project is to be developed through Public-Private Partnership (PPP).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis legacy project is of historical and economic significance to the focal communities, the people of Edo State, and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cApart from the generation of massive employment opportunities during the construction and operational phases, it is expected that this port would also position Nigeria to benefit from facilities of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), under which investment in agriculture is a major consideration.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the need for the development of a port in Edo State dates back to the pre-colonial era when the Portuguese accessed the Benin Kingdom through Benin River and Osse River for trade purposes, which culminated in the unfortunate military expedition of the British to Benin City, through same route in 1897.\n\nOn his part, the Project Director, Dr. Joe Aigboduwa noted, \u201cSeveral governments in Edo State have made attempts and failed, but the present administration, led by Governor Godwin Obaseki, stepped in to ensure the project is realized.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on three components for the port, which include the access road to the port, the port project itself and the channels leading to the port.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt only about 32km from the Atlantic Ocean, the Benin City River Port is strategically positioned to be the second nearest Port to the coastline in Nigeria, next only to that of Lagos,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the site chosen for the establishment of the port will benefit host communities, adding, \u201cthis will avoid relocating any community.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "National Assembly takes a stab at Electoral Bill, reversing hopes for electoral integrity",
          "text": "Key amendments designed to ground the conduct of future Nigerian elections in transparency and accountability seem doomed for the garbage bin as early as next Thursday when the National Assembly sits to review and pass the Electoral Bill that caucus leaders of Senate are currently fine-tuning in Abuja.\n\nThe caucus leaders now packed at the executive floor of the Transcorp Hotel in Abuja started their deliberations last Thursday to codify what will be the final laws that will regulate electoral conduct.\n\nInsider caucus sources told PREMIUM TIMES that some robust proposals and key priority amendments canvassed by citizens to strengthen the integrity quotient of the electoral bill on electoral voting, financial independence of INEC, and new timelines for submission of list of candidates, have now been rejected by the leadership of the NASS.\n\nSome of these recommendations include the use of electronic transmission of results of an election and expenses for presidential candidates.\n\nAs a token gesture, however, innovations like the independent candidate have now been inserted into the bill.\n\nIf the National Assembly has its way and passes the legislation, the bill will then be sent to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent to become law.\n\nAnd unless a last minute change is done, a new Electoral Amendment bill will be passed but hopes of key electoral reforms in subsequent elections will be lost.\n\nAbout half a dozen lawmakers who sought anonymity for this report spoke of what one of them called \u201ca shamefaced retreat from democratic accountability, a full-throated endorsement of corruption in elections and a surrender to electoral management fraud that I am personally ashamed to back.\u201d\n\nThe legislation\n\nThe bill seeks to repeal and re-enact the 2010 Electoral Act.\n\nIt also seeks to resolve issues concerning INEC\u2019s introduction of modern technologies into the electoral process, particularly accreditation of voters, electronic voting and electronic transmission of results from polling units.\n\nEfforts to get an earlier bill, passed by the Saraki-led 8th National Assembly, signed into law were futile with President Muhammadu Buhari rejecting it three times.\n\nIt was first rejected in March 2018 when Mr Buhari said the proposed law would usurp the constitutional powers of INEC to decide on election matters, including fixing dates and election order.\n\nA few months after that, he rejected it again citing \u201csome drafting issues,\u201d despite revision by the lawmakers. And in December 2018, Mr Buhari rejected another amended version, saying passing a new bill with elections close by could \u201ccreate some uncertainty about the legislation to govern the process.\u201d\n\nThe legislation was, however, reintroduced in the 9th Assembly and a joint committee on INEC (of the Senate and House of Representatives) was set up to work on the legislation.\n\nNASS blatantly ignoring demands of Nigerians\n\nThe journey to this tinkering process commenced when party leaders in the National Assembly decided on what they called \u201cadditional review\u201d of the outcome and work of the committee report on the amendment of the bill, ostensibly with a view to insert and reject some amendments. The insertions and deletions run contrary to the resolutions and proposals made by the committees.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nAlthough many individuals and groups who submitted memoranda and presented during the public hearing had similar demands, top among the proposals were introduction and improvement of modern technologies in elections as well as a reduction in the cost of elections.\n\nThe commission in charge of conducting elections, INEC, had proposed 34 amendments to the legislation \u2013 part of which includes punishment for electoral violators.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the major and glaring setbacks for democratic accountability is the limits to the already pervasive money game in the country\u2019s elections, and what a senator called, \u201ca depressingly dirty outing for campaign financing in our elections.\u201d\n\nThe new version of spending limit proposed in Section 88 of the bill now allows candidates seeking presidential office to increase their cash haul from the current N1 billion to N15 billion while governorship candidates can rake in N5 million from the hitherto N2 million.\n\nFor candidates eyeing a Senate seat, they can now look to legally raise N1.5 billion from the previous N40 million, while candidates to the House of Representative can now accept N500 million from the current N30 million. And for State Assembly, candidates are now free to call up N50 million from the previous N10 million.\n\n\u201cI agree that the integrity of the 2023 elections will be undermined should the bill be passed in its current form\u201d a parliamentarian in the House of Representatives said in Abuja on Sunday, arguing that \u201cyou may call this an irony but current budget to elect a senator in this country has never been less than 4 billion and if you consider the current value of the Naira it just looks like we are in an endless circularity.\u201d\n\nA still insignificant group of refuseniks who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES in Abuja on Sunday say they will try build a critical mass against Section 65 of the bill which they claim is \u201cperhaps the most alarming move by the National Assembly leaders which is an apparent rejection of the proposal empowering INEC to review results declared under duress or where a declaration is made in contravention of INEC guidelines.\u201d\n\nThis section proposes that the decision of the Returning Officer shall be final on any question arising from or relating to unmarked ballot paper, rejected ballot paper and declaration of scores of a candidate \u2013 a part of the bill that many Nigerians have kicked against.\n\nThis provision strips INEC of powers to decline issuing a certificate of return to a candidate where the Returning Officer was forced to declare him or her the winner or where the Returning Officer made an announcement under duress.\n\nAnother concern in the tinkered bill is the status of electronic voting which the party elders at their Transcorp retreat have gutted to make room for the contentious manual transmission that most commentators have pointed at as the basis of most electoral frauds in the country.\n\nThe committee had resolved that voting in an election and transmission of results under the Act shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBut the provision on procedure at election under Section 50(2) of the bill, was changed by the lawmakers in the approved version to read: \u201cVoting in an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC) which may include electronic voting, provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of elections by electronic means.\u201d\n\nEffectively, said a parliamentarian, \u201cSection 50(2) of the bill to prohibit electronic transmission of results fundamentally seeks to undermine INEC\u2019s effort to improve the election results management regime with the successful introduction of the election results viewing portal in recent elections.\u201d\n\nThe move by lawmakers of the National Assembly has already generated outrage among Nigerians and civic groups. Many have also said the president and leadership of the National Assembly have failed to fulfil their promise of free, fair and credible elections in the future as key electoral reforms are yet to be addressed.",

So the government\u2019s duty is to provide environment for learning to take place.\n\n\u201cIt is also our duty as teachers to condition ourselves to that situation so that teaching/learning could take place in a very favourable atmosphere.\n\n\u201cYou know that in the North, the security situation is worrisome. We need to do something about the security situation. The parents also need to encourage their children to return to schools.\n\n\u201cSometimes these people drop out of school because sometimes not because they don\u2019t have money because sometimes their colleagues or mates in other fields have made it in other areas of life.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Anambra, if your age mate has built a house for the father and he is driving a range rover jeep, you too have to do that. That is the reason for dropout in most cases.\n\n\u201cAlso, the economy has affected educational development/system in Nigeria. When you cannot feed, you cannot train your children. We all need to come to the drawing board and convoke educational conference where we can discuss ways forward out of the woods.\n\n\u201cIf we convoke education conference as they convoke conferences in other areas, we will be able to discuss what actually developed education after the war. It was the education conference they convoked that introduced the universal primary education,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Provost of the Federal College of Education (Technical), Isu, Ebonyi state, Prof Ruben Okey Okechukwu, has advocated an education conference in the country to discuss the way out of the many challenges confronting Nigeria\u2019s education system.\n\nAccording to the professor, the report of the conference will help in addressing the many challenges that have bedeviled the nation\u2019s education system.\n\nHe noted that a similar conference convoked immediately after the civil war in 1970 had developed education immensely which led to the introduction of the universal primary education.\n\nOn the ravaging insecurity plaguing some parts of the North, leading to kidnapping of students in exchange for ransom, he urged government to urgently arrest the ugly trend.\n\nOkechukwu, who spoke in Abuja after he was conferred with a professorial award by the Hipdet University and British American Business School, enumerated the problems confronting the education system to include increasing number of out-of-school children due to poverty, career imposition by parents and government misapplication of resources allocated to education.\n\nThis, according to him, has given rise to half-baked graduates whose output usually create doubt as to whether such a person went through a university or not.\n\nHe further stated that Nigerians needed orientation and sensitisation, adding that government and legislations cannot do it alone.\n\nWhile calling on the government to provide conducive environment for learning in schools in the country, Okechukwu advised parents not to impose courses on their children so that those who are gifted to study science should restrict themselves to science while those gifted in arts should be allowed to go with arts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe need a reorientation, recommitment and a redevelopment of the mind to approach the world as it is presently. So the government\u2019s duty is to provide environment for learning to take place.\n\n\u201cIt is also our duty as teachers to condition ourselves to that situation so that teaching/learning could take place in a very favourable atmosphere.\n\n\u201cYou know that in the North, the security situation is worrisome. We need to do something about the security situation. The parents also need to encourage their children to return to schools.\n\n\u201cSometimes these people drop out of school because sometimes not because they don\u2019t have money because sometimes their colleagues or mates in other fields have made it in other areas of life.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Anambra, if your age mate has built a house for the father and he is driving a range rover jeep, you too have to do that. That is the reason for dropout in most cases.\n\n\u201cAlso, the economy has affected educational development/system in Nigeria. When you cannot feed, you cannot train your children. We all need to come to the drawing board and convoke educational conference where we can discuss ways forward out of the woods.\n\n\u201cIf we convoke education conference as they convoke conferences in other areas, we will be able to discuss what actually developed education after the war. It was the education conference they convoked that introduced the universal primary education,\u201d he stated.",

It was the pope\u2019s first known hospital treatment since he was elected to the papacy in 2013.\n\nThe Vatican said the 84-year-old pope had been diagnosed with \u201csymptomatic diverticular stenosis of the colon\u201d, a reference to a narrowing in the large intestine.\n\nThe surgery was to be performed by Dr Sergio Alfieri, the director of Gemelli\u2019s digestive surgery department.",

          "text": "Ifeoluwa Oyeleke, the mother of Jumoke Monsurat Oyeleke, a 14-year-old girl who was slain during the Yoruba Nation march in Lagos on Saturday, claims she has yet to see her child\u2019s body.\n\nShe claimed that when she and her brother went to the police station where her body was thought to be kept, the officers on duty threatened to shoot her and her brother in the legs if they didn\u2019t leave right away.\n\nShe went on to say that the cops threatened them with a teargas canister. She did not, however, specify which police station they had attended.\n\nThe bereaved mother of four further said that the fatality was her firstborn kid.\n\nJumoke\u2019s body was found sprawled on the ground in a pool of blood, with her stomach ripped apart. This was shortly after policemen had opened fire to disperse those at the rally who were agitating for a separate nation for the Yoruba nation.\n\nThe police have, however, denied playing any part in Jumoke\u2019s death, saying that the blood found around her corpse was dry, and that it was an indication that the body was not fresh.\n\nWhen visited the mother of the deceased girl on Sunday evening, she was barely audible as she narrated her relationship with her late daughter and other issues surrounding their family.\n\nWhen she found the courage to speak, Ifeoluwa said, \u201cI got a call while I was in Ikeja where I had gone to work.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked to know what it was about, I was told that there was no issue but that my presence was needed at home.\n\n\u201cIt was when I got home that I learnt of what had happened. I was told that the bullet shot by the police killed my daughter.\u201d\n\nIfeoluwa stated that she had yet to see the corpse of her daughter since she got the news of her death yesterday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve not released her corpse to us. I and my brother, under last night\u2019s rain, got there, but were not allowed in. We heard them saying that if we stayed too long, they will shoot our legs and fire a teargas canister at us.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, my brother discussed with them and they allowed us in to see their Area Commander who said he heard that shots were fired but that he didn\u2019t know which station the officers behind it came from. \u201c\n\n\u201cHe said this could be determined when the extracted bullet is examined.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the police had told her anything about her daughter\u2019s corpse, she said no, adding that she didn\u2019t know where they took it to.\n\nShe stated that she would love to have a lawyer who would help her seek justice concerning the death of her daughter.\n\nSpeaking further, Ifeoluwa revealed that Jumoke was an apprentice at an ice cream shop and had just concluded Junior Secondary School education.\n\n\u201cShe usually sat in the shop and never hawked.\n\n\u201cShe had three siblings who are all girls. Her dad is dead,\u201d she said; adding, \u201cJumoke was a good girl who hardly got annoyed; she was hard working.\n\n\u201cAnyone who can rise to our defence should please do,\u201d she pleaded.",

Upon a proper search, 12 wraps of cocaine inserted in her private part were extracted while another 88 pellets stuffed in socks were discovered hidden in her handbag.\n\nDuring interrogation, Mrs. Ogbonna who is a mother of three children, all resident in Brazil, claimed she lost her husband three years ago. She confessed she decided to traffick the illicit drug to raise money for the burial of her father scheduled for 22nd July in Imo state.\n\nShe said one Emeka, alias KC also based in Brazil gave her the drug to deliver in Nigeria for a fee of $3,000. She said she pushed the wraps of cocaine into her private part after her attempts to swallow the pellets failed.\n\nREAD ALSO: VIDEO: Declare State Of Emergency On Insecurity, Recruit More Youths Into Military \u2013 Bishop\n\nThe suspect who owns a shop where she sells African foodstuffs in Brazil further claimed she had to drop her three young children with a Kenyan lady who is her neighbour in Brazil before she embarked on the quick-money-journey.\n\nIn a related development, narcotic officers attached to a courier company in Lagos have intercepted 500grams of ketamine concealed in the walls of a wooden box filled with bitter kola that originated from Douala, Cameroon and heading to the United States of America, while another 500grams of methamphetamine hidden in automobile parts going to Australia were also seized at the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, over 410 kilograms of assorted illicit drugs have been intercepted and seized by NDLEA operatives in Plateau and Kwara states. A commercial bus with registration number EKY 184 CQ Lagos was intercepted in Plateau with Diazepam weighing 39kg; Exol-5 tablets weighing 35kg and 1.7kg of Flumtrazepam tablets discovered in the vehicle.\n\nA follow-up operation led to the arrest of a drug dealer, Livinus Nnadi at Bauchi motor park on 26th June 2021 while on the same day, a blue Sharon minibus with registration number FKG 539 GR, going to Bauchi from Jos was also intercepted and 7.9kg of pentazocine injection recovered from it.\n\nIn the same vein, operatives of the Kwara state command of the Agency have recovered 67.2kg of Tramadol heading to Benin republic at a checkpoint close to Ilesha in Osun state while a 53-year-old drug trafficker, Zakiru Abdullahi has been arrested on Ilorin-Jebba highway on Thursday 1st July, with 260kilograms of pentazocine injection meant for Kaduna.\n\nReacting to all the successful operations, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) commended officers and men of Abuja airport, Plateau, Kwara commands of the Agency as well as those in the Directorate of Investigations and Operations, DOGI, attached to the courier firms for their diligence and commitment to work.\n\n\u201cLet me again commend all the gallant and vigilant officers and men in these commands and DOGI for their resilience and commitment to the mandate President Muhammadu Buhari has given us in the Agency to rid our towns, communities and even forests of illicit drugs and the criminal elements profiting from the unconscionable trade.

This means that the government would not have to choose between saving lives or making debt payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent overdraft of $25.6bn (about N9.7trn) reportedly obtained from the CBN would appear to be above the five-percent limit of the actual revenue of the Federal Government for 2020, that is, N3.9trn, prescribed by Section 38(2) of the CBN Act 2007. SERAP notes that five-percent of N3.9trn is N197bn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Section 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the Bank to grant overdrafts to the Federal Government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, sub-section 2 provides that any outstanding overdraft \u2018shall not exceed five-percent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the Federal Government.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Section 38(3) requires all overdrafts to \u2018be repaid as soon as possible and by the end of the financial year in which the overdrafts are granted.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN is prohibited from granting any further overdrafts until all outstanding overdrafts have been fully repaid. Under the CBN Act, \u2018no repayment shall take the form of a promising note or such other promise to pay at a future date, treasury bills, bonds or other forms of security which is required to be underwritten by the Bank.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Fiscal Responsibility Act provides in section 41 that the government \u2018shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development.\u2019 Under the Act, the government \u2018shall ensure that the level of public debt as a proportion of national income is held at a sustainable level.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 44 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act requires the government to specify the purpose of any borrowing, which must be applied towards capital expenditures, and to carry out cost-benefit analysis, including the economic and social benefits of any borrowing. Any borrowing should serve the public good, and be guided by human rights principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP has consistently recommended to the Federal Government to reduce its level of borrowing and to look at other options of how to finance its budget, such as reducing the costs of governance, and addressing systemic and widespread corruption in ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) that have been documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur requests are brought in the public interest, and in keeping with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution; the Freedom of Information Act; the Fiscal Responsibility Act; the Central Bank Act; the Debt Management Office Act; and the country\u2019s international legal obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a statutory obligation on the respondents, being public officers in their respective public offices, to proactively keep, organize and maintain all information or records about CBN overdrafts, loans, and repayments in a manner that facilitates public access to such information or records.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty in the performance in which the applicant has a sufficient legal interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless the reliefs sought by SERAP are granted, the respondents will not provide SERAP with the information requested and will continue to be in breach of their constitutional responsibilities and the country\u2019s international legal obligations and commitments.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "title": "Military Plane Transporting Troops Crashes in the Philippines",
          "text": "A military plane transporting troops has crashed in the southern Philippines after missing the runway during landing on Sunday, the military chief said.\n\nGeneral Cirilito Sobejana told reporters that at least 40 people have been rescued from the burning wreckage of the C-130, which crashed as it tried to land on Jolo Island, 1,000km (621 miles) south of the capital Manila.\n\n\u201cResponders are at the site now. We are praying we can save more lives,\u201d Sobejana said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate. The plane missed the runway, and it was trying to regain power but failed and crashed.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Jamela Alindogan reporting from the capital, Manila said medivac helicopters have been deployed to the crash site to transport the injured to nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cThe C-130 is one of the newly-acquired planes by the Philippines air force last February. The area where the crashed happened is home to one of the huge bases of the Philippines military. So transporting personnel is almost routine,\u201d Alindogan added.\n\nC-130 aircraft, the work horses of the air force, are used to transport troops and supplies. They are also often deployed to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\n\nThe accident comes after a Black Hawk helicopter crashed last month during a night-time training flight, killing all six on board.\n\nThree pilots and three airmen died when their S70-i went down near the Crow Valley training range north of Manila, prompting the grounding of the entire fleet.\n\nThe Philippines ordered 16 of the multi-role aircraft from a Polish firm that made them under licence from the Sikorsky division of US defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nEleven have been delivered since late 2020.\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nREGIONAL\n\nKaduna Governor El-Rufai Wants Carpet Bombing of Forests to Eliminate Bandits in Northwest Nigeria\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has declared that the military must launch a grand offensive against armed bandits in the North-west in order to free the region of the scourge of kidnapping perpetrated by bandits.\n\nHe said though the military had sustained the decimation of the criminal elements using air strikes and ground troops, insufficient attack aircraft and troops had derailed a final clearance operation.\n\nThis is coming as the Kaduna State chief security officer raised the alarm that bandits were planning to attack his children\u2019s school and kidnap them.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Service (BBC), el-Rufai said a military-led offensive must be initiated to eliminate once and for all bandits operating in North-west forests.\n\n\u201cWe must kill all the bandits who must go to the forest and carpet bomb and kill everyone there. This has been our position for the past two years. I\u2019m happy to say that this is being done, not in the coordinated manner that I wanted, because I wanted this to happen at the same time in all seven states of the North-west.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough planes. We don\u2019t have enough soldiers. We don\u2019t have enough to do this simultaneously. So it\u2019s been done gradually, but there has been a lot of degradation of the bandits\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI assure you we are killing them. We are wiping out their camps, and the military and the the the air force particularly and the Nigerian army with special forces have been doing a great job.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t know how many attempted kidnaps we have foiled many people don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t talk about it. They only know the ones that have succeeded\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State chief executive has withdrawn his children from Kaduna Capital School following security reports of a plot by bandits to attack the school and kidnap his children.\n\nHe told BBC that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also noted would expose other children to danger.\n\nThe governor, had, in a bid to revamp public education in the state enrolled two of his children, Abubakar Sadiq and his younger sister, Nasrine.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the children, who had taken to home study, were withdrawn from school following security reports made available to him.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai said the state government had maintained its position against payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nThe governor had disclosed in an earlier media interview that the plot to abduct his children was designed to see if he would not pay ransom.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals.\n\n\u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna. Anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nSeven killed in Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa LGAs\n\nIn a related development yesterday, armed bandits reportedly killed seven persons within the last 72 hours in Chikun, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas of Kaduna State, an official of the state said last night\n\nAccording to him, the developments were reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies on yesterday.\n\nThe source said the bandits shot four kidnapped citizens at the outskirts of Tsohon Gayan general area of Chikun LGA.\n\n\u201cTwo were identified as Solomon Bamaiyi and Francis Moses from Kakau village of the same LGA. The third was identified as being from Kachia town and the fourth remains unidentified.\n\n\u201cIn I Station, Kajuru LGA, two citizens, Reuben Tanko and Sani Jibrin were also shot dead by a group of armed bandits.\n\n\u201cOne Danjuma Alhaji, a native of Tsohon Farakwai of Igabi LGA was similarly killed by bandits at the outskirts of Galadima general area of Giwa LGA\u201d, he added.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai was said to have sent condolences to their families and prayed for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security agencies have carried out confidence building visit to Iri Station, where some citizens were killed and an unspecified number kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who led the delegation assured the community of government\u2019s commitment to the security and peace of the general area\u201d, the official explained.\n\nHe also said that collaboration between communities and security agencies is critical and must be cultivated towards enhancing security in areas that are difficult to access across the state.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "England produced a magnificent display as they thrashed Ukraine in Rome to set up a Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark at Wembley.\n\nManager Gareth Southgate\u2019s side followed up the landmark victory over Germany in the last 16 by producing a performance of composure and the highest quality to continue their impressive progress in this tournament.\n\nHarry Kane was back to his predatory best after struggling in the group stage, following up his goal against Germany by poking home a superb pass from Raheem Sterling after only four minutes.\n\nUkraine barely threatened and England \u2013 having reached the last four at the 2018 World Cup \u2013 were on their way to a second successive semi-final when Harry Maguire powered home a header from Luke Shaw\u2019s free-kick seconds after the break.\n\nAnd the outstanding Shaw was the creator once more four minutes later with a perfect cross that was headed in from six yards by Kane.\n\nEngland were so impressive as they simply overpowered Ukraine with substitute Jordan Henderson getting the fourth \u2013 his first international goal, in his 62nd appearance \u2013 when he arrived with perfect timing to head in Mason Mount\u2019s corner.\n\nTo add to England and Southgate\u2019s satisfaction, they kept their fifth successive clean sheet to maintain their record of not conceding a goal at Euro 2020.\n\nThey will now meet Denmark in the last four at Wembley on Wednesday.\n\nEngland manager Southgate never wavered for a second in his belief that captain Kane would have a significant impact on Euro 2020, even when he looked off the pace and out of sorts when failing to score in group games against Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s faith was rewarded when Kane got off the mark with England\u2019s crucial second in the 2-0 win over Germany. It was the catalyst for the real Kane to come alive in the tournament \u2013 and he punished Ukraine in trademark style.\n\nKane pounced for his first, rose to power in a second for his 47th England goal and almost completed a hat-trick in spectacular fashion with a left-foot volley that was turned on to the post by Ukraine keeper Georgi Bushchan.\n\nHe was a constant threat, his link with Sterling increasingly impressive, and has timed his return to peak form perfectly as England now stand only 90 minutes away from their first major final since they won the World Cup in 1966.\n\nKane is the man defences fear \u2013 and even the in-form Danes will regard this display as ominous.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Shaw has had to fight to revive his England career \u2013 having been behind Chelsea\u2019s Ben Chilwell for some time, he missed out on a start against Croatia in the Euro 2020 opener, when Southgate used Kieran Trippier in the left-back role.\n\nIt has all changed since he was brought into the side for the goalless draw against Scotland. Shaw has made a magnificent contribution to England\u2019s run to the semi-final and will be one of the first names on the teamsheet for the game against Denmark.\n\nShaw has been solid in defence while proving to be a potent creator of goals, setting up Sterling\u2019s vital opening goal against Germany then setting up two more here, first with pitch-perfect delivery from a free-kick and then a perfect cross.\n\nIt has not been a smooth ride for Shaw, who emerged as a teenager at Southampton before his big-money move to Manchester United in June 2014.\n\nHe has suffered serious injury at United, and was never trusted by Jose Mourinho when he was their manager, but is now delivering for England in a major tournament \u2013 proof of his character, and an achievement that makes that long road even more worthwhile.\n\nSouthgate has manoeuvred his England squad with great expertise throughout Euro 2020, demonstrating the riches he has at his disposal.\n\nIn Rome, he was able to give a first start in the tournament to Jadon Sancho, the 21-year-old who has just agreed a \u00a373m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nSancho slotted in perfectly, showing huge confidence and ambition in a timely reminder of what he can offer.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Mount also returned the England side, with two creators in the shape of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish and Manchester City\u2019s Phil Foden left on the bench.\n\nHenderson, the vastly experienced Liverpool captain, made his mark while Marcus Rashford was also introduced off the bench.\n\nIt was proof, amid an imperious victory, that Southgate\u2019s England squad has the sort of quality and depth that will make them confident they can finally end that 55-year wait for success.\n\nGareth Southgate is just the second manager to take England to the semi-final of both the World Cup and the European Championship, after Alf Ramsey in 1966 and 1968.\n\nThe Three Lions have kept seven consecutive clean sheets for the first time in their history. They have not conceded for 662 minutes.\n\nThis was Ukraine\u2019s joint-biggest defeat in a match at a major tournament, equalling their 4-0 defeat by Spain in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nRaheem Sterling has been involved in 22 goals in his past 21 games for England (15 goals, seven assists), while Harry Kane has been involved in 27 in his past 26 for the Three Lions (18 goals, nine assists).\n\nSterling has provided six assists for Harry Kane for England in all competitions, more than any England player has assisted another in the 21st Century.\n\nLuke Shaw\u2019s assist for Harry Maguire was the first time two Manchester United players have combined for an England goal at a major tournament since David Beckham assisted Paul Scholes against Portugal at Euro 2000.\n\nEngland keeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets at Euro 2020 \u2013 no keeper has ever kept more in a single staging of the competition before.",

Twenty-four people are known to have died and 121 are missing.\n\nNo survivors have been pulled from the rubble at the site in the Miami suburb of Surfside since the first few hours after the structure\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe families of the missing were told in advance of the decision to pause the search effort, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Cava Levine said.\n\nThe decision to bring forward the demolition of the remaining block was made after concerns were raised over the approaching Tropical Storm Elsa, which is expected to reach the west coast of Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe mayor of Surfside, Charles Burkett, said strong winds in the coming days could bring down additional debris from the unstable structure, endangering the lives of the search teams.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that the building was a problem,\u201d he said on Saturday, adding: \u201cWe agreed that the only solution for that problem was to eliminate it.\u201d\n\nMr Burkett said the controlled demolition could take place \u201cas early as [Sunday]\u201d, and should be completed within days.\n\nAnnouncing the temporary pause in the search operation, Mayor Cava Levine said the latest developments \u201cdo not signify that we are no longer focused on search and rescue\u201d.\n\nShe said preparations for the demolition included \u201cdrilling into columns in the unsafe structure\u201d and a pause was needed while the process was under way.\n\n\u201cWe will begin the search and rescue once again on any sections of the pile that are safe to access as soon as we\u2019re cleared,\u201d she said.\n\nDrones and 3D imaging equipment are being brought in to help those combing the rubble for signs of life.\n\nThe mayor signed a demolition order on Friday. She initially said she expected the demolition would not happen until late July.\n\nThere are no details so far about compensating the owners of the apartments. Meanwhile, officials are investigating other tower blocks in the area for structural faults.\n\nOn Friday, a firefighter carried the body of his own seven-year-old daughter from the rubble of the collapsed block. He had kept vigil at the site for nine days and was there when she was extracted.\n\nStella Cattarossi, who was reportedly with her mother, grandparents and an aunt visiting from Argentina, was the third child to be recovered from the site.\n\nWhat caused the 40-year-old Champlain Towers South to crumble remains unclear. A 2018 inspection, however, warned of \u201cmajor\u201d design flaws in the original design.\n\nThe building association\u2019s board has said it will appoint an \u201cindependent receiver\u2026 to oversee the legal and claims process\u201d.",

          "title": "Nigeria: New Draft Electoral Law Bars Electronic Transfer of Results",
          "text": "A new Electoral Act Amendment Bill which provides for total ban of electronic transmission of votes is to be introduced at the Senate next Tuesday.\n\nThe provision forms part of the 121-page document to be laid before the upper legislative chamber at plenary by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabir Gaya.\n\nThe proposed piece of legislation is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to repeal the Electoral Act No 6, 2010 and enact the Electoral Act 2021, to regulate the conduct of Federal, State and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory elections, and for related matters\u201d.\n\nBut this current draft, which is said to be at variance with what was earlier agreed to by the committees of the two chambers of the legislature, THISDAY gathered, might result in a showdown amongst the lawmakers, when the draft is tabled for debate this week.\n\nThis is as the Senate Committee chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya was said to have concluded plans to clear Ms. Laureate Onochie as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nThe bill, which has 153 sections, is divided into eight parts including Establishment and function, etc of INEC, Staff of the Commission, National register of Voters and Voters\u2019 education and procedure at election.\n\nOther parts of the bill are political parties, Electoral Offences, determination of election petitions arising from election petitions and Miscellaneous.\n\nThe draft bill, a copy of which was sighted by THISDAY, allowed for electronic voting by secret ballot but ruled out electronic transmission of the votes cast at the poling units.\n\nThis is contained on Page 25 of the document and subtitled procedure at election under Section 50(2) of bill which states: \u201cVoting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC) which may include electronic voting provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nAccording to section. 50 (2) of the new draft, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting, PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\nThe draft bill further stated that, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be by open secret ballot\u201d and that \u201cA voter on receiving a ballot paper shall mark it in the manner prescribed by the Commission.\n\n\u201cAll ballots at an election under this Bill at any polling station shall be deposited in the ballot box in the open view of the public.\n\n\u201cNo voter shall vote for more than one candidate or record more than one vote in favour of any candidate at any one election. (2)Where the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding Officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\n\u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), the Commission may, if satisfied that the result of the election will not substantially be affected by voting in the area where the election is cancelled, direct that a return of the election be made.\n\n\u201cWhere a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification under this section.\n\n\u201cThe Commission shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers\u201d, the draft bill stated.\n\nTHISDAY findings revealed that this clause was sneaked into the draft bill by some leaders of the legislature without the knowledge of the committee members.\n\nA ranking Senator and member of the Senate committee on INEC, upon enquiry, told THISDAY that at no time was that provision discussed at the committee level talk less of inserting it in the draft bill.\n\nThe Senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, he now understood why the delay in presenting the bill after the committee had long concluded its work.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is not funny at all. I now know why the presentation of the report had been delayed this long after we finished our work at the committee level. They have been playing hide and seek on the matter.\n\n\u201cFor all I know and other committee members can bear me witness, the issue of ban on electronic transfer of votes was not part of the report we wrote. So, that means the committee Chairman is culpable and owes the committee members an explanation over the strange insertion\u201d.\n\nThe bill, which has been in the works for some time would be laid before the Senate next Tuesday by Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Gaya.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the bill would then be scheduled for debate on Wednesday with the former governor of Kano State and committee Chairman, Senator Gaya, leading the debate by summarising the provisions of the bill.\n\nHowever, the bill may run into crisis as there are plans by some Senators especially, members of the Senate Committee on INEC to oppose the strange clause included in the draft.\n\nTHISDAY gathered at the weekend that the Senators had already begun to reach out to their colleagues, explaining that they were not part of the inserted clause.\n\nThey have, therefore, pledged to resist the clause banning electronic transmission of votes cast during the general debate of the bill this Wednesday.\n\nIn a related development, despite the protests against the person of Ms Onochie, the source claimed the Senator Gaya-led committee has concluded plans to approve her appointment as an INEC national commissioner.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",
          "summary": "Other parts of the bill are political parties, Electoral Offences, determination of election petitions arising from election petitions and Miscellaneous.\nThe draft bill, a copy of which was sighted by THISDAY, allowed for electronic voting by secret ballot but ruled out electronic transmission of the votes cast at the poling units.\n50 (2) of the new draft, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting, PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means\u201d.\n\u201cThe Commission shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers\u201d, the draft bill stated.\nTHISDAY findings revealed that this clause was sneaked into the draft bill by some leaders of the legislature without the knowledge of the committee members.",

          "text": "Recent fighting in the Tigray region of Ethiopia has resulted in a famine that is now affecting more than 400,000 people, UN officials say.\n\nIn its first public meeting on the crisis, members of the UN Security Council warned that as many as 33,000 children were severely malnourished.\n\nOfficials said that a further 1.8m people were on the brink of famine as a result of the eight-month conflict.\n\nThey also warned of further clashes despite the declaration of a ceasefire.\n\nThe Ethiopian government, which has been fighting regional forces in Tigray, declared a unilateral ceasefire on Monday.\n\nHowever, rebels vowed to drive their \u201cenemies\u201d from the region and there have been reports of sporadic clashes as pressure builds internationally for all sides in the conflict to pull back.\n\nThe fighting between the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and government forces has already left thousands of people dead and more than two million people have been displaced.\n\nAll sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out mass killings and human rights violations.\n\nOn Friday, several thousand captured Ethiopian soldiers were paraded through the streets of the Tigrayan regional capital Mekelle.\n\nOn Friday, the UN\u2019s acting humanitarian aid chief told members of the Security Council at a meeting in New York that the situation in Tigray had deteriorated dramatically in recent weeks.\n\nThe region was experiencing \u201cthe worst famine situation we have seen in decades\u201d, Ramesh Rajasingham said.\n\n\u201cClose to 5.2 million people still require humanitarian assistance \u2013 the great majority of them women and children,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has denied allegations that it is been blocking aid after Tigrayan rebels took control of much of the northern region earlier this week.\n\nThe UN political affairs chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, told the meeting that further clashes were likely between Tigrayan forces, the Tigray Defence Forces (TDF), and Ethiopian troops, supported by Eritrean soldiers and Amhara regional forces.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for more confrontations and a swift deterioration in the security situation which is extremely concerning,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe urge the TDF to endorse the ceasefire immediately and completely.\u201d\n\nThe fighting began last November, when rebels rejected political reforms and captured army bases. Government forces captured Mekelle later that month.\n\nFollowing a rapid offensive, rebels retook Mekelle and earlier this week entered the town of Shire, about 140km (90 miles) to the north-west, according to UN officials.",
