          "text": "SOME parents of the abducted students of Bethel Baptist High School, Kaduna, have said the kidnappers called them to pick up their children at different locations with the promise that they (students) have all been released.\n\nHowever, only 15 of the students, who were kidnapped in July, regained their freedom on Sunday after 46 days in the captors\u2019 den.\n\nThe students, who were picked up at different locations by their parents after calls were placed to them (parents) by the abductors, were discovered to be weak and could barely walk.\n\n\u201cThey called us individually and told us to come and pick our children. When we got to the location they left our children, we found them very weak, barely able to work,\u201d Samuel, one of the parents, disclosed.\n\nAnother parent, Ruth Makama, disclosed that she was called upon to come for her daughter, but on getting there, she discovered her daughter was not one of those released.\n\nTwenty-eight students were earlier released after the payment of N50 million, while the latest release was after the payment of an additional N24 million.\n\nThe students, 121 in numbers, according to the President, Kaduna Baptist Conference, who is also the Proprietor of the school, Rev. Ishaya Jangado, were kidnapped in the early hours of July 5, 2021, around 2am on the school premises along the Kaduna-Kachia highway, Damishi, Chikun LGA of the state.\n\nWith the release of 15 out of the 80 students, 65 of the students are still in the kidnappers\u2019 den\n\nThe students were handed over to the traumatised parents at around 1:30pm.\n\nThe students, who were conveyed in an 18-seater bus into the secretariat, were not looking unkempt, a contrast to condition of the first batch of 28 students earlier freed by the bandits.\n\nThe development, the President of the Baptist Convention, Rev. Israel Akanji, explained was because the released students were allowed to refresh before being reunited with the parents unlike the previous ones who looked unkempt and pale.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after handing over the students to their parents, Akanji said they expected the bandits to release the remaining children, who he said, were 78 with them (bandits).\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE leadership of the Indigenous People of Biafra has warned the people of the South-East to be vigilant on Monday (today), claiming security agents may unleash mayhem on innocent citizens and blame it on members of the Eastern Security Network.\n\nThis is as the secessionist group reiterated that it had no plan to enforce its hitherto weekly sit-at-home order, alleging that it had uncovered a plot by security operatives to disguise as its members and those of ESN to \u201cattack traders who come out tomorrow for their legitimate businesses\u201d.\n\nIPOB noted that it was expedient for the global community to be aware that it had since two weeks ago suspended its earlier weekly sit-at-home order.\n\nThe proscribed group stated this in a statement signed by its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Sunday.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe intelligence unit of IPOB has uncovered secret plots by the Nigeria security agencies, most especially the DSS and the police to disguise as IPOB and ESN operatives to attack traders who come out tomorrow for their legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cIPOB restates that there is no longer Ghost Mondays in Biafra land in solidarity with our detained leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Sit-at-home will only be observed on the days our leader will be making appearances in court.

          "text": "In line with the promise of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure an efficient oil and gas sector for economic development in Nigeria, the president not only assented to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) but has approved a steering committee to oversee the process of implementation of the act.\n\nThe committee, according to the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, will be headed by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nOther members of the committee are: permanent secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Executive Chairman, FIRS, Representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Finance, Budget and National Planning, the Senior Special Assistant to the president On Natural Resources.\n\nMr Olufemi Lijadu will serve as Legal Adviser while the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund, PTDF, will serve as head of the coordinating Secretariat and the Implementation Working Group.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the committee shall be to guide the effective and timely implementation of the PIA in the course of transition to the petroleum industry envisaged in the reform programme, and ensure that new institutions created have the full capability to deliver on their mandate under the new legislation.\n\nAccording to the president, the committee has 12 months to complete the assignment and periodic updates will be given to the president.\n\nIn the week under review, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) assured Nigerians that the Federal Government has no immediate plans to increase the price of petrol following the signing of the PIB into law by Buhari.\n\nAccording to the Corporation, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timpre Sylva, revealed this at a news conference to mark his second year in office, adding that the ministry had delivered on its promise to have the PIB passed into law.\n\nSylva highlighted the achievements of the ministry in the last two years to include the reduction of smuggling of petroleum products which has brought down the daily consumption of petrol from 66million liters per day to 52 million, reduction of cost of crude oil production by five per cent, with the possibility of hitting 10 per cent.\n\nHe said though the subsidy regime has ended with the coming into effect of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the government was mindful of the impact of deregulation on Nigerians and so would not rush into its implementation to ensure the welfare of ordinary Nigerians.\n\nThe Minister further explained the incorporation of the NNPC Limited as required by the PIA and the, the three percent host community fund as enshrined in the act.\n\nOn the planned divestment by Shell, the Minister said that Shell was still keen on investing in Nigeria as it is an existing partner in the operation of OML 245, adding that he was in consultation with the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to iron out the legal issues.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria currently had the capacity to produce three million barrels of crude oil per day but was restricted to 1.4million barrels because of international obligations.\n\nAlso, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari has expressed his appreciation to President Muhamadu Buhari for signing the Petroleum Industry Bill into law without delay.\n\nKyari who spoke after the signing of the bill allayed the concerns of the oil producing communities, explaining that the three per cent approved under the new Petroleum Industry Act for Host Communities Fund could be bigger than what the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) currently gets.\n\nHe clarified that the law mandates the payment of three per cent of oil companies\u2019 operating expenses in the previous year to the host oil communities, which are mostly in the Niger Delta.\n\nAccording to him, with about 16 billion dollars total operating expenditure by the oil and gas sector last year, as much as 500 million dollars could accrue to the Host Communities Fund yearly.\n\nThe GMD said although in the past there were attempts to make sure that oil companies provided for the host communities, it was not done in the right manner, even if carried out in the name of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects.\n\nHe stressed that the signing into law of the new Act essentially means transforming from the Petroleum Act which was enacted in 1969 to a law that is relevant to current realities, adding that with the legislation, the NNPC would now operate under the Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nGiven the new scenario, Kyari pointed out that the NNPC would become more efficient, slimmer and a much more commercially focused national oil company at par with its peers across the globe, pledging that the company will do better under the new arrangement.\n\nHe added that there was already a framework established by government, which would take care of the transition within the time frame of six months to incorporate and transfer assets and personnel, among others.\n\nWhile the new law envisages a fully deregulated market, Kyari stressed that a number of engagements have been going on to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nHowever, he said when deregulation eventually happens, there would be safeguards against market manipulation to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not unduly exposed.\n\nStill in the week under review, the Corporation pledged improved collaboration with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) to enhance the Corporation\u2019s transparency and accountability quotient while receiving the President of ICAN, Mrs. Comfort OluEyitayo, at the NNPC Towers, Abuja.\n\nOn her part, Eyitayo commended the GMD for his leadership style while noting that the institute was taking note of the deliberate steps taken by the NNPC to institute global best practices in accounting.\n\nOn poor power supply in Borno State, The NNPC said that to tackle the challenge, it has taken the execution of the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) and Equipment Procurement contracts for a 50 Megawatts (MW) Emergency Power Project in Maiduguri.\n\nThe project which is an integral part of the ongoing efforts to deepen the Corporation\u2019s domestic gas utilisation plan for the nation\u2019s socio-economic growth has China Machinery Engineering Company (CMEC) as the EPC contractor while General Electric (GE), the equipment manufacturer.\n\nSpeaking at the contract signing event Kyari explained that the Corporation through its subsidiary, NNPC Gas and Power Investment Company (NGPIC), decided to intervene in the Maiduguri power situation by undertaking the project which would be fired with Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and run commercially.\n\nHe said NNPC, as a state-owned oil company and enabler organisation, was determined to boost power generation and supply to Nigerian homes through increased investment in gas-fired combined cycle power plants to produce at least five Gigawatts (GW) additional power for the country.\n\nVice President of GE Africa & Europe, Mr. Raisin Brice, said the company was committed to working with NNPC to achieve success in the Power Project, noting that GE would be tapping into its vast experience in the country to deliver on the project.\n\nSimilar support and commitment were echoed by Mr Fang Yanshui, President of CMEC, the main EPC contractor for the project.\n\nAs a mark of confidence in the project, the contractors have already started moving vital equipment to site as work has commenced. I\n\nOn Fire Safety, the Federal Fire Service (FFS) has commended the NNPC for its strict adherence and commitment to fire and environmental safety practice in all its operations.\n\nThe commendation was given by the Comptroller General of the FFS, Alhaji Liman Ibrahim, while presenting certificates of fire safety to the Corporation at the NNPC Towers, Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Comptroller General, represented by Deputy Superintendent of Fire, Mr. Sunday Oduye, said NNPC had always prioritised the health and safety of its workforce as well as that of the environment, adding that the revalidation of its fire safety certificates for the next three years was a testament to that fact.\n\nOn his part, the General Manager, Group Health, Safety, Environment and Quality, GHSEQ, NNPC, Mr Hussaini Ali, said the revalidation was part of efforts to secure the NNPC Towers against fire incidents.\n\nHe noted that as a public limited liability company, it was necessary for the corporation to be insured comprehensively to attract investment.\n\nFire safety certification is an instrument required for the procurement of insurance cover which indemnifies the organization against liabilities in case of fire or any damage to its properties.\n\nAlso in the week under review, Kyari reiterated the Corporation\u2019s commitment to support the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited towards achieving its goal of becoming a global LNG company of choice.\n\nSpeaking as a Guest of Honour at the 2021 NLNG Health Safety and Environment (HSE) Day, the GMD, who was represented by the Group General Manager, LNG Investment Management Services (LIMS), Nike Kolawole, said HSE was a critical determinant of business performance success across the oil and gas industry.\n\nKyari stated that as a principal shareholder in the company, NNPC would continue to ensure that NLNG placed more emphasis on HSE, stressing that \u201cno matter the figures, indices or values recorded in production, sales, profit or revenue, a dismal HSE performance would lead to obliteration of long built achievement\u201d.\n\nHe remarked that the rapid growth of NLNG from the base project (Trains 1 and 2) to six trains was unprecedented and commended the company for its ability to adapt and effectively manage changes within the period.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the outgoing Managing Director of NLNG, Mr. Tony Attah, said the focus of this year\u2019s HSE Day was on identifying the weak and dark corners for continuous improvement on the organization\u2019s HSE policy.\n\nGlobal Crude Oil Outlook\n\nOil prices weakened for a fourth session due to a strong dollar as surging cases of coronavirus in Japan added to a weak demand picture in Asia.\n\nBrent crude ended the session down 48 cents, or 0.7 per cent, at 69.03 dollars per barrel, while U.S. West Intermediate crude (WTI) settled 70 cents, or one per cent lower at 66.59 dollars a barrel.\n\nThe dollar advanced for a second straight session, bolstered by safe-haven demand. A strong dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nJapan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions on Tuesday and announced new measures covering seven more prefectures to counter a spike in COVID-19 infections that is threatening the medical system.\n\nHedge funds and money managers cut net long positions in U.S. crude to the lowest since November in the week to Aug. 10 as resurgent coronavirus infections in several countries dampened hopes of a rapid resumption in long-distance air travel.\n\nMeanwhile, the market intelligent department of the NNPC London office reported that Russian crude oil production costs hit a 10-year high in the second quarter of 2021 as companies increased their capital spending in response to the OPEC-plus alliance\u2019s move to gradually increase output.\n\nA rising tax burden and a deterioration in the quality of Russia\u2019s oil reserves \u2014 which are becoming more difficult to extract \u2014 also contributed to the increase in costs.\n\nDaily crude processing in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, fell to its lowest in July since May 2020 as independent plants slashed production amid tighter quotas, high inventories and weakening profits, data showed.\n\nChina\u2019s factory output and retail sales growth also slowed sharply and missed expectations in July, as new COVID-19 outbreaks and floods disrupted businesses.\n\nOn the supply side, U.S. shale oil output is expected to rise to 8.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, the highest since April 2020, according to government data.\n\nLast week, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration urged OPEC+, a group comprising of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers such as Russia, to boost oil output to tackle rising gasoline prices.(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "According to the president, the committee has 12 months to complete the assignment and periodic updates will be given to the president.\nIn the week under review, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) assured Nigerians that the Federal Government has no immediate plans to increase the price of petrol following the signing of the PIB into law by Buhari.\nHe noted that Nigeria currently had the capacity to produce three million barrels of crude oil per day but was restricted to 1.4million barrels because of international obligations.\nAlso, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari has expressed his appreciation to President Muhamadu Buhari for signing the Petroleum Industry Bill into law without delay.\nGlobal Crude Oil OutlookOil prices weakened for a fourth session due to a strong dollar as surging cases of coronavirus in Japan added to a weak demand picture in Asia.",

          "title": "What Nigerians think of COVID-19 vaccines",
          "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic gradually settles into its second year, it has so far mutated into different variants and created different waves, presently exhibiting the Delta variant which is being tracked and monitored by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which believes the variant is one with increased transmissibility, GRACE OBIKE writes.\n\nAll viruses naturally mutate over time in ways that help them survive and COVID-19 is not left out. Before the Delta variant, also known as the lineage B.1.617.2, Nigeria had previously identified the B I.I.7 which was first identified in the United Kingdom (UK) and B.I.525 variant strains which were equally initially identified in other countries including the UK, Denmark etc.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said the Delta variant had, by August 1, been reported in132 countries including Nigeria. According to the WHO, infections have continued to rise in every region of the world, with some even reaching 80 per cent more in the past month. In Africa, deaths have increased by 80 per cent over the same period, Gebreyesus warned. The increase is being attributed to the highly transmittable Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus, increased social mixing and mobility, the inconsistent use of public health and social measures, and inequitable vaccine use\n\nOn July 9, Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) Head of Communications Dr Yahya Disu announced the Delta variant had been detected in a traveller to Nigeria and four days later, 12 new infections were reported in Oyo state, Southwestern Nigeria, leading to two fatalities. Six states were placed on red alert following the detection of this new variant in the country\n\nHow far has Nigeria gone\n\nHistorical data accessed from the NCDC indicated that as of August 11 2021, 179,118 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in the country since the first case was reported in March last year. Of this number, 10,783 cases were still hospitalized, 166,141 cases had been discharged and 2,194 people had died from the disease, while a total of 2,589,130 samples had been tested so far.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria took delivery of the first batch of 3.94 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, on the 2nd of March 2021. The country is expected to receive a total of 16 million doses over the next few months. Nigeria is the third African country, after Ghana and Cote D\u2019Ivoire to receive the vaccines from the COVAX facility\u2014 a joint partnership between the WHO, the Center for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF which aims to send vaccines to developing countries. Nigeria aims to inoculate 70% of its 200 million population by 2022.\n\nThe arrival of the vaccine triggered a surge in anti-vaccine misinformation which such as that perpetrated by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar asked the government not to compel Nigerians to take the vaccine.\n\nKogi State Governor Yahaya Bello on March 6 went on live TV to insist he would not take the vaccine as he was healthy even as his colleagues from other states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) launched the exercise in their states by being vaccinated.\n\nReligious leaders have also been at the forefront in spreading harmful misinformation against vaccines. Religious leaders such as General Overseer of the Living Faith Church International (Winners Chapel) Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Believers Love World aka Christ Embassy Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, have since March been campaigning against the vaccine urging their congregations not to take the vaccine but instead place their trust in God and use \u2018anointing oil\u2019 which they are \u2018blessing\u2019 and selling to gullible congregants under the pretext that the oil will protect them from getting sick.\n\nThe Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Kaduna state, the Rev Joseph Hayab has called out these religious leaders for misleading their congregations. He said religious leaders should educate themselves about the virus, the way it is spread, the benefits of the vaccines instead of misleading their congregations with half-truths about the virus and the vaccines.\n\nThe Rev Hayab said he had personally attended several training workshops where he interacted with health experts and he even consulted medical experts and doctors from his congregation and others who provided the information he has been using to urge his congregation to take precautions and to take the vaccines.\n\nHayab, who is a survivor of COVID-19, said: \u201cBefore COVID-19, many of us had received yellow fever vaccine. Have you ever seen Yellow Fever? Do you know what it looks like? We have received meningitis, tetanus vaccines. When it comes to medical science, let\u2019s not bring stories that are primitive and selfish. I have seen instances where clerics deceive their people not to receive medications and they end up burying them, I am therefore appealing to religious leaders not to comment on things they are not experts of. Just leave it,\u201d he says.\n\nQuelling the level of hesitancy\n\nNigeria Health Watch has already debunked many of these claims and conspiracy theories in an article looking at the reasons for vaccine hesitancy which ranged from low literacy to distrust in the government.\n\nA global survey found that respondents who trusted their government were more likely to accept a vaccine. Those who distrusted their governments were more likely to believe in alternative explanations for things that were happening.\n\n\u201cWhat we keep saying is that the government must know what it says to the people about COVID-19 because I think one of the major confusions is the way and manner the government presents the information. The government tells us to observe social distancing and reduce large crowds but when they have political activities, they meet in large crowds, so they make people ask questions of who is lying,\u201d says Rev Hayab.\n\nDismissing the misleading information the former chief medical director of the University of Maiduguri teaching hospital, Prof. Idris Mohammed told off religious and political leaders in an interview with the Punch Newspaper: \u201cIrrespective of your own belief or scientific knowledge or lack of it, you should act in such a way as to protect the people from infection. And if you say the infection does not occur at all, then, you are telling people to just relax and not take any measures to protect themselves, COVID is real, it exists and it is killing people.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and his Vice President Yemi Osinbajo led government ministers, state governors and other state functionaries in taking the vaccine.\n\nPublic awareness campaigns are being carried out in the media as the government kicked off the vaccination beginning with the elderly and frontline workers including health workers and journalists.\n\nBy June 29 the executive director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Faisal Shuaib said approximately 88 per cent of the total COVID-19 vaccine stock in the country had been administered.\n\nBy July 13, 3,938,945 million doses of the vaccine had been administered, with 1,404,205 people fully vaccinated and 2,534,205 people received at least one dose of the vaccine. Of the vaccinated, the country recorded 14,550 cases of mild/moderate Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI), with 148 cases considered to be severe. AEFI can include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site.\n\nNigeria is expected to receive additional vaccines with 3,924,000 doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca being shipped into the country by the end of July or early August 2021. Another 3,930,910 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech COVID-19 vaccine donated by the US government are due in August.\n\n\u201cAbout 3,577,860 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech COVID-19 vaccine in Q3 in the coming months, 29,850,000 doses of Johnson & Johnson (Jassen) COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX facility by the end of September, that will arrive in batches from the African Union Commission,\u201d Dr Shuaib says.\n\nAnd just as promised, Nigeria on the 2nd of August 2021, received four million and eighty doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine from the United States (US) government, with a promise of more to come.\n\nHow receptive are Nigerians?\n\nA survey on the perceptions of Nigerians to COVID-19 vaccines conducted by the Africa Center for Disease Control released in February 2021 showed that 76% of Nigerians are willing to accept the vaccine, with younger respondents (24 and under) less keen to receive the vaccine than their older counterparts.\n\nThe demographics broken down is as follows: 77% of Nigerian men are willing to be vaccinated as opposed to 76% of women, 71% of Nigerians ages 18-24 are willing as opposed to 87% of respondents ages 55 and over. 88% of respondents who Know someone who has had COVID, would take the vaccine as opposed to 76% of respondents who do not or 80% of respondents who think the general vaccines are safe and 42% of respondents who do not believe in its safety.\n\nThe survey also revealed that 69% of Nigerians are more likely to trust radio for information on COVID-19, while 36% prefer social media. At the same time, 8% of respondents are less willing to trust government sources and 14% less willing to trust healthcare authorities. A breakdown of the response of 488 respondents on the government\u2019s management of the resources provided for the outbreak: 368 of them rate it as poor, 82 rate average and just 38 feel it\u2019s good about it.\n\nAfrica CDC\u201d findings mirror those of a research conducted by global biosecurity titled, \u201cWillingness to Participate in Testing, Contact Tracing, and Taking the COVID-19 Vaccine among Community Members in a Southwestern State in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe survey had 691 respondents from different communities in Ondo state. Of the number, 244 were aged 21-29, 436 were willing to take the COVID-19 test, 458 were willing to disclose contacts\u2019 names if tested positive, and 434 were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPersons who earned less than 30,000 naira ($78.95) monthly were more likely to take the COVID-19 test than those who earned less. Those who were better educated ( 10-12 years of education) were three times more willing to disclose contacts if they tested positive for COVID-19. Those whose financial status had worsened due to the pandemic were three times less likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nVaccines are not widely available to everyone and therefore the issue of vaccine hesitancy or willingness cannot be fully determined. In Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, Esther Bitrus said the council offered them the vaccine but she rejected it. \u201cI am not saying that I don\u2019t believe in COVID-19, I do. But to be honest, they just continue to talk of how people are getting sick from the virus but I don\u2019t know of anyone that suffered from COVID-19. I think the government is using it to divert money and scare us enough so we don\u2019t ask questions,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother survey that sought to get the perception of Nigerians to the vaccine and their willingness to accept the jab was conducted by the Nigeria Health Watch in Bauchi, Bayelsa, Ebonyi, Kebbi, Lagos, Niger states and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). https://nigeriahealthwatch.com/will-you-take-the-covid-19-vaccine-a-household-survey-on-the-perception-of-nigerians-towards-a-covid-19-vaccine/\n\nA total of 1,089 people participated in the survey with 730 respondents from urban areas and 359 from rural areas. Of those surveyed 85% had heard about the COVID-19 vaccine, over two-thirds were willing to take the vaccine while more than half 56% welcomed the vaccine and had no fears about the jab.\n\nReasons for vaccine hesitancy given by Some respondents said they will not take the vaccine because of what they have heard from others, and images and videos of adverse reactions on traditional and social media. Religious beliefs showed up strongly as a reason why respondents said they were unwilling to take the vaccine.\u201d\n\nPeople dismiss the possibility of taking the vaccine simply because they do not believe that the COVID-19 virus exists. Responses portrayed a general mistrust of public information as well as a desire to see before believing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat government intends to do\n\nTo encourage people to take up the vaccine, Dr Shuaib said the government was going to enhance its public awareness campaigns and share more factual information about the benefits of taking the jab. \u201dIt is increasingly evident that conspiracy theories and rumours are misleading people. We must not allow any information vacuum that mischief-makers would take advantage of to further mislead innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe government was already putting in place logistical details for the storage, distribution, security, and accountability for the 41.2 million doses that it expects between now September.\n\nThe Federal Government has procured 60 units of U701 ultra cold chain equipment and deployed 37 of them to all the 36 States and FCT in readiness to receive the vaccines which are required to be stored in ultra-cold temperatures of below 40 to 85 degrees to maintain efficacy.\n\nDuring a facility tour of the National Strategic Cold Store (NSCS), on the 2nd of August 2021, representative of the WHO country representative and Medical officer/ cluster leader, communicable and non-communicable diseases WHO, Dr. Anne Baptiste said the WHO is satisfied with Nigeria\u2019s cold chain capacity and deployment plans.\n\nWay forward\n\nDuring the just-concluded world hepatitis day, several districts of the rotary club in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) organised campaigns in different communities to educate people on the disease and offered free tests and vaccines in places that would have been ignored. The action made a lot of people come out en-mass and partake in it.\n\nIf the same strategy is used with COVID-19, more people might take it more seriously, more Nigerians will be educated on the issue and just like Rev. Hayab said, if the government starts practising what they preach in terms of social distancing and all the protocols put in place to stop the spread of the virus, people might end up taking it more seriously and try to partake in stamping COVID-19 out of the country and continent, rather than seeing it as political than a reality.",

He claimed the perpetrators would come under the guise of IPOB volunteers to create chaos.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have perfected plans to unleash attacks on innocent people in the name of ESN and IPOB volunteers. We have no plans again to enforce any sit-at-home order. They want to wear jeans trousers and combat knicker jeans and brand it ESN and IPOB volunteers. Our people should resist any attempt by anybody to attack them tomorrow (today). Fleet of Hilux vehicles have also been set aside for this assignment. Our people need to be cautious,\u201d Powerful alleged.\n\nThe group had directed the Mondays sit-at-home order in solidarity with their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who is facing trials in an Abuja court, but relaxed it to days he would appear in court following appeals from a section of Igbo populace.\n\nSaid Powerful: \u201cWe want to put the world, especially residents of Biafraland that IPOB has since two weeks ago suspended its initially declared Monday sit-at-home order. It, therefore, makes no sense that we will at the same time be enforcing the suspended order. IPOB restates that there is no longer ghost Mondays in Biafraland in solidarity with our detained leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Sit-at-home will only be observed on the days our leader will be making appearances in court. Such days will be well publicised ahead of time.\n\n\u201cEverybody is hereby placed on alert about this wicked plot. IPOB will not tolerate any attack on any Biafran or resident of Biafra under any guise. People should be allowed to go about their businesses without any molestation or harassment. We are warning politicians and traitors including security agents who have designed to destroy IPOB and tarnish our hard-earned global reputation to retrace their steps. Biafrans are free to come out tomorrow and every Monday to do their normal business. All market leaders in Biafraland are advised to comply with this directive and ensure their markets are open for business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhiele, the disownment of Radio Biafra director, Simon Ekpa, has confirmed serious cracks within IPOB.\n\nIn a memo jointly released by National Coordinator of the group,Anthony Obasi, national secretary, Chika Madu and Victoria Nwada, national financial secretary, IPOB Finland branch, denied Ekpa\u2019s membership of the group even in Finland where he is said to be based.\n\nEkpa was earlier clarified to be Kanu\u2019s successor at Radio Biafra only for the group to make a U-turn and disown him.\n\nThe group in the memo said: \u201cIPOB family members worldwide over the issues as to whether Mazi Simon Ekpa is a registered member of IPOB Finland or not where he is resident, we the IPOB Finland family under the command and leadership of Nnamdi Kanu wish to make it categorically clear to whom it may concern that Ekpa is not a member of IPOB before now, and till date he is still not a registered member according to our records. The memo has been issued to set the records straight before all and sundry that henceforth anybody that is dealing with Ekpa on issues concerning IPOB worldwide will consequently have himself or herself to blame.\u201d\n\nThere was a clash of counter directives of the sit-at-home order in solidarity of leader of the group facing trials at the court by the family and the heads of the group.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nControversy has continued to trail the killing of a student of Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo, Nurudeen Alowonle, as mortuary attendants at the Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos, produced a wrong corpse for the family, activists and friends who had gathered to pick the corpse for burial on Friday.\n\nAlowonle, a Faculty of Education student of LASU and the Coordinator, Education Rights Campaign (ERC), Lagos State chapter was shot death on Wednesday night after Iba gate of the university while a staff of the institution with him was injured.\n\nHe was a student activist, a member of the Democratic Socialist Movement (DSM) and also a former presidential candidate in the students union elections of 2019, had early appeared before the Students Disciplinary Panel same day in an alleged contrived case of admission racketeering.\n\nIn a statement, the National Coordinator of (ERC), Hassan Taiwo, said \u201dmany of you would have been surprised that contrary to initial reports that late Alowonle would be buried on Friday, he eventually was not buried.\n\nHis words: \u201dI got to the morgue of Mainland Hospital Yaba in the morning of Friday, August 20th. I met Nurudeen Yusuf in the presence of some doctors and other well wishers. We were shown what was said to be the remains of Alowonle. It was nothing more than a mass of entrails which was highly decomposed and put together in a body bag.\n\n\u201dThe mortuary attendants said those who brought the \u2018body\u2019 \u2013 the Lagos State Environmental Agency claimed that vehicles had ran over the \u2018body\u2019 between the period of 10pm Wednesday night when he died and 5am Thursday morning it was brought to the morgue.\n\n\u201dUpon seeing the state of the alleged body, we had to protest that there was no means to identify the entrail as a human entrail let alone a human body. We said there was no way we could present this to the family as the \u2018body\u2019 of their son. Our protest including the assistance of sympathetic student doctors who studied in LASU and the HOD Pathology, eventually led to the revelation by the mortuary attendant that they made a mistake and presented to us a wrong body.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the mortuary attendants brought another body which was that of Alowonle. He observed that the body had a hole by the side just under the rib cage on the left hand side of the chest.\n\nTaiwo explained that tension began to build up and following discussion, it was agreed that an autopsy be conducted but the ongoing doctors strike made it impossible.\n\n\u201dThis made the family to insist that the body be buried the very day. Those of us pushing for autopsy had no choice but to submit to the desire of the family. The family also gave us the right to choose any befitting burial place for him.\u201d\n\nHe said some activists processed and got documents for the body to be released for burial but the disclosure by the Divisional Police Office of Adoff that the police claimed a patrol found the body around 10pm and called the Lagos State environmental agency to pick the body.\n\nSaid he: \u201dThe agency did not show up until 5am the next morning. During this time, there was no record that the police offered any first aid assistance to Alowonle or even tried to take him to the hospital to see if he could be revived. As we all know, only a qualified medical personnel, and not the police, can declare a body dead or lifeless.\n\n\u201dSecondly, the DPO claimed that the police patrol was around the vicinity where the attack and killing took place but police said they were not shot but stabbed. When the mortuary attendants who prepared Alowonle\u2019s body and sutured his wound were interviewed, they claimed that the wound they observed on the body could only be caused by gunshot. This also coincided with the testimony of the lone survivor, Wahab Majekodunmi, who said they were shot.\n\n\u201dThe last straw that would break the camels back was the request of the DPO that the family must swear an affidavit that they would not demand an autopsy as a precondition for release of the body. Of course, this request raised suspicion as to the motive of the police. It appeared to us that the police just wanted the body to be buried so that the truth of what happened can be buried with it, \u201d he stated.\n\nTaiwo explained that while this controversy was going on, a directive came from the Chief Pathologist of Lagos State, Prof John Obafunwa, to the mortuary that the body should not be released until an autopsy is conducted.",

          "text": "*Akume, Al-Makura, Shettima, Yari, Adamu, others join race\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAs the All Progressives Congress (APC) prepares for its national convention later in the year, following the nod received from the governors of the ruling party, many aspirants have intensified their lobby to succeed the Chairman of the National Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nProminent among the APC chairmanship aspirants are a two-term governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Abdulaziz Yari; two-term Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura; another two-term governor of the state, Senator Abdullahi Adamu; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; a former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and another former Governor of the state, Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\nA former governorship aspirant in Kwara State, Mr. Salihu Mustapha, is also in the race and is the youngest aspirant, while speculations are rife that a former Governor of Gombe State and senator representing Gombe Central senatorial zone, Senator Danjuma Goje, is also in the race to succeed Buni.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the Ondo State governorship election, which put a question mark on Buni\u2019s dual role as governor and chairman of the ruling party, coupled with multiple litigations challenging his position, APC governors had given the Buni-led committee a go-ahead to organise the party\u2019s local government and state congresses, as well as national convention.\n\nThe latest in the gale of litigations challenging Buni\u2019s chairmanship of the APC was filed last week by Mr. Samuel Irabor on behalf of 100 members of the party, urging the Federal High Court in Abuja to dissolve the Buni-led 13-member caretaker committee of the APC.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs also told the court that the chairmanship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC Constitution.\n\nIt is also the contention of the plaintiffs that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer Oath of Office to Buni as caretaker chairman of the party.\n\nHowever, despite all the suits challenging the legality of the Yobe State governor\u2019s appointment as the chairman of his party, the APC governors had thrown their weight behind the Buni-led committee to organise the national convention.\n\nThough the ruling party had on many occasions clarified that it had not zoned the presidency and other offices ahead of the 2023 general election, all the aspirants for the party\u2019s chairmanship position are from the North.\n\nThis has rekindled the hope for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the southern part of the country.\n\nYari, a two-time Governor of Zamfara State, had indicated his interest to run for the office of the National Chairman of the APC.\n\nHe had after the completion of his two-term in office as governor in 2019, decided to retire to the Senate Chamber of the National Assembly like most governors do by contesting a senatorial seat.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court judgment which nullified all the elections won by the APC in the state truncated his ambition to retire to the red chamber.\n\nYari is believed to be highly competent and experienced with wide contacts as a former governor and former Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nHowever, his alleged high-handedness in the running of affairs of the APC, while he held sway as the governor of Zamfara State, which ultimately led to the loss of the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic (PDP) is said to be working against his ambition to lead the ruling party.\n\nSimilarly, the emerging political supremacy battle in the state, where he has locked horns with the newly defected governor Bello Matawale is going to be a major setback in his bid to lead the party at the national level.\n\nAPC members have also cited Yari\u2019s alleged consistent intransigence to the resolutions of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee on the leadership of the party in Zamfara State as his albatross.\n\nAlso, his case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged mismanagement of public funds running into billions of Naira, has become a sort of a moral burden on his neck.\n\nAl-Makura is another political heavyweight in the race for the position of the National Chairman of APC.\n\nHe enjoys the advantage of being a former Governor of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) extraction and a serving Senator.\n\nSources within the ruling party said Al-Makura is one of the aspirants to watch due to the strong support he enjoys from the governor of his home state, Mr. Abdullahi Sule, who had publicly declared support for him.\n\nHowever, his recent invitation by the EFCC over alleged mismanagement of multi-billion naira while he held sway as the Governor of Nasarawa State is an obstacle that could ruin his ambition.\n\nParty sources said if the damning evidence presented against him by the petitioners from his home state is anything to go by, then the former governor may as well bid his ambition farewell as it is unlikely that the APC and especially President Muhammadu Buhari would accept anything short of a clean slate from the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nAnother former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, representing Nasarawa West senatorial district is also in the race.\n\nAdamu is also a very competent and experienced politician and first civilian governor of the state.\n\nA former minister and secretary of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Adamu is as influential as any politician could aspire to be, and has been on the corridors of power for decades.\n\nHowever, sources in the APC said his old age is counting against him.\n\nAdamu also has to deal with the opposition at the home front as the governor of the state, Sule has thrown his weight publicly behind Al-Makura, Adamu\u2019s fiercest political rival in the state.\n\nAnother aspirant for the office of the Chairman of APC, Sheriff is an experienced political heavyweight and fighter, who led the PDP during its crisis.\n\nSheriff was elected as a Senator in 1999 on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP).\n\nIn 2003, he defeated the sitting governor, Mala Kachalla, at the party primaries, and won the election on the platform of All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). It was the APP that changed its name to ANPP.\n\nSheriff was re-elected as governor in 2007.\n\nHe is a founding member of the APC but he defected to the PDP in 2014.\n\nHe later became the national chairman of the PDP after the party lost the 2015 elections. His leadership was however marred by crisis and the party became factionalised.\n\nThe Supreme Court later declared the other factional leader and former Governor of Kaduna State, Mr. Ahmed Makarfi, as the authentic chairman of the PDP. In April 2018, Sheriff returned to the APC.\n\nNo doubt, the former governor of Borno State is a crafty and dogged politician with a very deep pocket to prosecute any political ambition.\n\nHowever, committed APC chieftains are said to be uncomfortable with the alleged \u2018spoiler\u2019 role he played in the PDP and his inconsistency, which makes him switch political parties at will.\n\nHe was also alleged to have sponsored the terrorist group, Boko Haram Islamic sect, an allegation he had dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d.\n\nShettima is another two-term Governor of Borno State and former Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nThese positions he had held may count in his favour as he contests for the chairmanship of the ruling party.\n\nHis cordial relationship with the governor of his home state, Prof. Babagana Zulum, is also an added advantage to his efforts to realise his ambition to lead the APC.\n\nHowever, whatever achievements he recorded as Borno State governor were blighted by the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nMustapha is not only the youngest of the contenders but one of the two in the race who is neither an incumbent nor a former governor or Senator.\n\nNevertheless, the Kwara-born businessman brings to the table a robust experience in party administration that spanned decades.\n\nHe also has a vast political network within the progressive fold.\n\nHe is also a well-known long-term political ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, starting from his days in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to the days of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), where he served as a Deputy National Chairman under the Tony Momoh-led NWC of the party between 2011 and 2013.\n\nMustapha also has grassroots influence in his home state and a rich network of friends across the country.\n\nMustapha is said to be running a campaign that appeals to both the young and the old members of the party.\n\nCodenamed B.R.I.D.G.E.S, Mustapha\u2019s campaign seeks a return to the party\u2019s founding ideals of progressivism and internal democracy.\n\nHowever, he has never held a top political position like governor or member of the National Assembly and this may count against him.\n\nA former governor of Benue State under the platform of the PDP, Akume is also said to be in the race.\n\nAkume, a two-term governor was re-elected Senator for Benue North-West in the April 2011 elections, on the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nSince he lost the senatorial seat to Senator Emmanuel Yisa Order-Jev of the PDP in the 2019 general election, his political fortunes at the home front have nosedived considerably and this led to a total loss of control of the state by the APC.\n\nBut his experience as a two-term governor, and his current position as a serving minister in President Buhari\u2019s cabinet, will boost his chances.\n\nHowever, APC sources have described him as being \u2018docile\u2019 and \u2018laid back\u2019 in his campaign for the party\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nGoje is also said to be in the APC chairmanship race but his alleged ambition has remained in the realm of speculation.\n\nThe former Gombe State governor and Senator representing Gombe Central had after his victory in the 2019 general election, formally declared that he would not seek any political office again.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves Hit $37bn with $3.5bn New SDRs",
          "text": "* Apex bank threatens to revoke MFBs\u2019 licences over fx transactions\n\n* Seeks labour\u2019s collaboration to grow economy\n\nFestus Akanbi, Kunle Aderinokun, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign reserves will get a timely boost on Monday when the country\u2019s share of $3.5billion from the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to boost global liquidity, matures for collection.\n\nConsequently, the nation\u2019s foreign reserves currently put at $34billion will hit the $37billion threshold, which will boost the capacity of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to fund higher volumes of external transactions and achieve a further convergence of the exchange rate around the I & E window.\n\nThis is coming as the CBN has threatened to revoke the operating licence of any microfinance bank found engaging in foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe apex bank has also urged the organised labour to collaborate with it to grow the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe approval for the SDRs credit was announced by the board of IMF on August 4.\n\nSDRs are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the IMF.\n\nThey are units of account for the IMF and not a currency.\n\nAlso, they represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged. SDRs were created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign exchange reserve assets, namely gold and United States dollars.\n\nManaging Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, who confirmed the maturity of the IMF\u2019s credit to THISDAY yesterday, said: \u201cUpon receipt of the IMF\u2019s SDR credit of $3.35billion expected on August 23, we expect gross external reserves to increase to about $37billion. This will provide more support for the CBN to support the currency and lead to a further convergence of the exchange rate around the I & E window.\u201d\n\nRewane also said in the August edition of the FDC Monthly Update, released during the weekend, that \u201can increase in the gross external reserves will support the CBN\u2019s intervention at the foreign exchange markets and help in the convergence of the parallel market rate towards the rate at the I&E window.\n\n\u201cIn the first fortnight of August, Nigeria\u2019s gross external reserves maintained a steady accretion. The reserves gained 0.30 per cent to $33.58billion (August 13). The cumulative gain as of August 13 is $180million. At $33.58billion, the reserves level is sufficient to cover 8.24 months.\n\n\u201cWe expect the CBN\u2019s increase in forex supply to commercial banks to support the exchange rate for invisibles in the near term and ultimately, close the gap between the parallel and official rates (N104/$ as of August 13). Similarly, we expect the $3.35billion IMF SDR allocation to increase the external reserves level to about $37billion and support the CBN\u2019s intervention in the forex market,\u201d Rewane explained.\n\nAbout $275 billion (193 billion SDRs ) of the new allocation would go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nThe economic research firm projected additional foreign exchange accretion through the anticipated rise in higher oil revenue in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe expect the increase in Nigeria\u2019s domestic oil production to be sustained in the coming months barring any disruptions,\u201d the FDC report stated.\n\nIt added that: \u201cAn increase in oil production will offset the fall in oil prices and this will lead to higher oil revenue. This will impact positively on the fiscal and external balances of the country.\u201d\n\nFDC quoted the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) monthly oil report as stating that Nigeria\u2019s domestic oil production increased by 3.60 per cent (45,000 barrels per day) to 1.44mbpd in July from 1.39mbpd in June. This, according to the report, is 22.58 per cent below the benchmark of 1.86mbpd.\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil rig count had increased by 40 per cent from five to seven in June.\n\nConsequently, the company expects oil prices to remain soft in the near term due to the surge in Covid-19 cases globally.\n\nFDC stated, \u201cChina, a major importer of oil, recently imposed lockdown measures. This will dampen its oil demand prospects and weigh on the oil price. We expect oil prices to stay within the $70 per barrel- $74pb range.\u201d\n\nIt explained that although lower oil prices and the attendant reduction in oil earnings cannot be ruled out, the government\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery will be the saving grace.\n\n\u201cOil accounts for 86 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings and contributes approximately 10 per cent to GDP. Lower oil prices coupled with Nigeria\u2019s low oil production would lead to reduced oil earnings and government revenue.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in the Dangote Refinery, which is projected to be the largest single-plant in the world, guarantees a steady supply of crude to the refinery and will boost the NNPC\u2019s revenue. In addition, the Kaduna and Warri refineries will undergo rehabilitation and complement the Dangote refinery. Nigeria could be on its way to being becoming a regional oil hub,\u201d the report added.\n\nCBN Threatens to Revoke MFBs\u2019 Licences over Fx Transactions\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN has threatened to revoke the operating licence of any microfinance bank (MFB) found engaging in foreign exchange transactions.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, some of the MFBs had been engaging in activities beyond the remit of their licences as they dealt in foreign exchange transactions and practised wholesale banking, considered as non-permissible activities for micro banking institutions.\n\nThe CBN, which read this riot act in a \u2018Circular to All Microfinance Banks\u2019 with reference: FPRD/DIR/PUB/CIR/01/020, dated August 19, 2021, cautioned that acting outside beyond their mandates with comparatively low capitalisation, posed a significant risk with dire consequences for financial system stability.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has observed the activities of some Microfinance Banks (MFBs) that have gone beyond the remit of their operating licences by engaging in non-permissible activities, especially wholesale banking, foreign exchange transactions, and others.\n\n\u201cGiven the comparatively low capitalisation of MFBs, dealing in wholesale and /or foreign exchange transaction is a significant risk with dire consequences for financial system stability,\u201d the circular stated.\n\nThe CBN, in the circular, titled, \u2018Cessation of Non-Permissible Activities by Microfinance Banks\u2019, signed by Deputy Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department, CBN, Mr. Ibrahim S. Tukur, reminded all MFBs to strictly comply with the extant Revised Regulatory and Supervisory Guidelines for Microfinance Banks in Nigeria 2012.\n\nStating that it would continue to monitor developments in the MFB sector, it stressed that it would apply severe regulatory sanctions for breaches of extant regulations including revoking the licence of non-compliant MFBs (in line with Section 19 of the Guidelines).\n\nAccording to Section 19 of the Guidelines: \u201cThe grounds for revoking a licence granted to an MFB may be any or all of the following: (a) Submission of false information/data during and/or after the processing of the application for licence; (b) The use of proxies or disguised names to obtain a licence to operate as an MFB; (C) Engaging in functions/activities outside the permissible scope of its licence as specified in Section 2.2 of these guidelines; (d) Persistent failure to comply with request for information/data in the form required/specified by the CBN; (e) Engaging in activities prejudicial to the Nigerian economy; (f) Failure to redeem matured obligations to customers; (g) Failure to render statutory monthly returns for a continuous period of six months or for a cumulative period of six months in a financial year; (h) Unauthorised shop closure; (i), Failure to comply with any directive issued by the CBN; (j) Engaging in prohibited activities as listed in these Guidelines; (k) Technical insolvency, that is, where an MFB\u2019s assets are insufficient to cover its liabilities; (i) Such other conditions applicable to banks and other financial institutions which constitute a ground for revocation of licence under the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 1991(as amended); and (m) any other act(s) which in the opinion of the CBN constitute(s) a violation or a serious default.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank, however, stated for the record, the permissible activities of specialised micro-institutions. \u201cMFBs are strictly prohibited from foreign exchange transactions; MFBs are to primarily focus on providing financial services to retail and/or micro-clients; Microcredit and retail transactions carried out by MFBs are limited to N500,000 per transaction for Tier 2 Unit MFBs and N1,000,000 per transaction for other categories; Micro-credit facilities shall constitute a minimum of 80 per cent of total loans portfolio for MFBs,\u201d it pointed out.\n\nThe latest CBN circular came on the heels of measures it had taken in recent times to save the value of the naira and maintain its integrity.\n\nAbout a month ago, it suspended forex allocations to bureau de change (BDC) operators.\n\nAs soon it cut off direct supply to the BDCs, it released $200 million to the commercial banks and has continued to serve them forex liquidity, weekly.\n\nThis was part of efforts to meet dollar demand for legitimate end-users in the country.\n\nBut not too long after, some of the banks (though names undisclosed), were indicted for round-tripping.\n\nThey were accused of flouting the forex rules by actively conniving with unscrupulous customers to defraud the system.\n\nThis set of customers and banks were, however, threatened with stiff sanctions by the banking regulator. The threat came after the 357th Bankers Committee meeting, which was held virtually, recently.\n\nThe bank CEOs, who reported the unwholesome practices by the banks and customers, noted they would adopt digital means to detect fraud in the forex system. Managing Director of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Yemisi Edun, and Group Managing Director of Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), Segun Agbaje, spoke on behalf of the banks. The Bankers Committee membership, which comprises banks\u2019 CEOs and CBN directors, has the CBN governor as its chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking yesterday in Lagos on the sidelines of the one-day interactive enlightenment session with organised labour and civil society on the CBN\u2019s five-year policy thrust, the apex bank\u2019s acting Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, called on the labour to collaborate with it for inclusive growth across the economy.\n\nWhile giving clarity on the circular issued on MFBs, he emphasised that the practices by some MFBs pose significant risks to the banking system.\n\nHe also called on the labour to collaborate with the CBN to grow the economy.\n\nNwanisobi said: \u201cThe CBN alone cannot bear with all of the issues in the Nigerian economy and we believe that it is important that every Nigerian key into the reality that we need to grow our economy. It is not just about the CBN or the Nigerian government; it is about the Nigerian people and we believe that the labour, being a significant stakeholder group, would be able to take this message to their people.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on labour and everyone to support the interventions by the CBN as these policies of the CBN are to grow the economy sustainably so we can see how to get inflation to single digits.\n\n\u201cOur interventions are very well thought-out; it is not something that comes out of the curve; we sit down to think through these interventions before we get it out to the public and the whole essence is to grow the real economy sustainably,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "This is coming as the CBN has threatened to revoke the operating licence of any microfinance bank found engaging in foreign exchange transactions.\nSDRs are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the IMF.\nSDRs were created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign exchange reserve assets, namely gold and United States dollars.\n\u201cIn the first fortnight of August, Nigeria\u2019s gross external reserves maintained a steady accretion.\nThe economic research firm projected additional foreign exchange accretion through the anticipated rise in higher oil revenue in the coming months.",

There he met Dr Obafemi who was one of the most junior doctors at the facility. Dr Obafemi didn't know he was Yusuf and didn't bother to know.\n\n\u201cAll he knew was that he is a son of \u2018somebody\u2019 for him to have been escorted by policemen. He sought to give him the best treatment primarily as a patient. After a brief examination, he realised that Yusuf was an orthopaedic case and their facility was not one.\n\n\u201cHe called his Head of Department who didn't pick up his calls and later called Dr Ibrahim Wada, the owner of the facility. None picked his numerous calls. When he realised Yusuf would die if he didn't refer him to a hospital where he can get the best care, he referred him to Cedarcrest (where he knew they were are into such treatment),\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also PUBLIC HEALTH How Guests At Yusuf Buhari\u2019s Wedding Violated COVID-19 Protocols\n\nThe source revealed further that \u201cshortly after Yusuf was sent to Cedar Crest, news got to Wada and the HOD that a 'big fish' was at their hospital, they all came in hurriedly to devour the loot.

After a brief examination, he realised that Yusuf was an orthopaedic case and their facility was not one.\n\n\u201cHe called his Head of Department who didn't pick up his calls and later called Dr Ibrahim Wada, the owner of the facility. None picked his numerous calls. When he realised Yusuf would die if he didn't refer him to a hospital where he can get the best care, he referred him to Cedarcrest (where he knew they were are into such treatment),\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also PUBLIC HEALTH How Guests At Yusuf Buhari\u2019s Wedding Violated COVID-19 Protocols\n\nThe source revealed further that \u201cshortly after Yusuf was sent to Cedar Crest, news got to Wada and the HOD that a 'big fish' was at their hospital, they all came in hurriedly to devour the loot. On getting to their hospital, reality dawned on them that \u2018bloody Dr Obafemi had transferred Yusuf\u2019, they were mad!\u201d\n\nThe source said the transfer of Buhari\u2019s son to another hospital so angered Obafemi\u2019s superiors that they sacked him as they had lost an opportunity of making good money for treating the first son.\n\n\u201cTheir madness led to the sacking of Dr Obafemi for having the audacity to transfer a patient without their authorisation.\n\n\u201cFortunately for Dr Obafemi, there was a lady that works at Nisa Premier whose husband works at Cedarcrest. They discussed the issue at home and the husband told their boss about the sacking of the doctor that brought their 'gold mine' to them. The CMD then called Dr Obafemi to offer him a job,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source went further to say the doctor (Obafemi) was \u201cearning N120,000 at Nisa Premier and it was increased to N150,000 at Cedarcrest.\u201d\n\nThe source continued, \u201cSeeing life was unfair to him, Dr Obafemi gathered money together to go and take PLAB (Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board test) in the UK with the mind of relocating abroad (mind you he graduated at 24 from the University of Ilorin, so he was very brilliant).\n\n\"The majority of the money he got was loan from the bank, to be paid back with interest - as his salary could barely feed and provide accommodation for him. Mind you, to take PLAB, you will need nothing less than N2.5 million, as at then, for the exams, flight and accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe source said Obafemi failed the examination and subsequently committed suicide.\n\n\u201cHe was not given enough leave to study for PLAB because he worked in a private hospital, so he failed PLAB. The news of his failure, plus the army of creditors who daily hunted him for their money got to him and he checked into a hotel in Suleja and committed suicide.\n\n\u201cThe hotel guys realised he was not coming out at 12pm and wasn't responding to their knocks on the door, so they called the police who opened the door and found him dead, with his certificates in a file and a suicide note apologising to his parents.\n\n\u201cHe was from a lowly background, so he wanted to change their lives after becoming a doctor and realised the system (Nigeria) was constantly against him. Even though we wouldn't do that but our level of tolerance differs.\n\n\u201cThat was the brief story of the doctor that made it possible for our \u2018jobless boy\u2019 to ever dream of a celeb wedding,\u201d the source concluded.\n\nWATCH: @MBuhari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Groomsmen Spending Money They Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Work For In Kano\n\n\n\nFULL VIDEO: https://t.co/sAlm1LjYOt pic.twitter.com/yunrvXI1a1 \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) August 20, 2021",

Okay, so it was supposed to be a hookup. But it wasn't really exactly put like that. Well, she told me that a family friend of hers wanted to meet someone nice and cool.

          "title": "Explained: Can the Nigerian government really spy on your WhatsApp messages?",
          "text": "Barely a month after blocking access to Twitter, the Nigerian government allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for a \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d.\n\nAn interception solution for WhatsApp would allow an external party (the government, in this case) to access, monitor, or block communications (calls and chats) carried out by users via the app.\n\nThe move is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigeria from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms. However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Per Zoom\u2019s blog post, once the host \u2014 the teacher \u2014 activates it, students will only be able to see the host and not their peers, who could distract them.\n\nBack to school kit: The new feature is part of Zoom\u2019s effort to maximise online learning for students who can\u2019t resume physically due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor some, starting a new school year could mean shopping for new devices instead of the usual backpacks, uniforms, and socks.\n\nMore online schooling? The pandemic remains a real threat as it continues to spread. Per The Vanguard, Nigeria recorded 790 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, August 11, 2021, the highest in six months.\n\nActive cases in the country now stand at 11,500.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nIt\u2019s 9 days to SME Clinic 2021.

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "FG to resume conditional cash transfer in the week ahead\n\nThe Federal Government disclosed that it will resume the conditional cash transfer to beneficiaries across the country from the 23rd of August.\n\nRead also: FG to restart cash transfer payment to beneficiaries Aug. 23\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by the National Coordinator of the programme, Hajiya Halima Shehu, National Cash Transfer Office (NCTO) under the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs at a meeting with State Focal Persons of the National Social Investment Programme in Abuja on Friday.\n\nShe disclosed that the delay in resumption is due to a system upgrade being carried out by the FG, to boost efficient service delivery. Upgrades including \u201ctweaking the payment modalities to respond to cashless realities, security concerns and digitization of the payment processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty per cent of its operations have been digitalized and will recommence payment to its beneficiaries next week,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also signalled that not all states would start receiving cash transfers from the 23rd of August due to other operational bottlenecks, and urged for understanding with stakeholders, citing that the FG is committed to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\nGold posts gains but still trades below the $1800 threshold\n\nThe yellow metal closed the week with a 1% gain, after a flash crash earlier in the week, that caused the asset class to trade below the $1,700 levels in the Asian session on Monday.\n\nGold had a rollercoaster ride this week which many see as a comeback. the benchmark gold futures contract declined to $1,677.90 after closing the previous week at $1,763.10, representing a 4.83% decline during the Asian trading, in what has largely been characterized as a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d\n\nImpressively, after gold crashed to $1,677.90 according to investing.com, the market quickly recovered to end the week at $1,781.55, representing a 6.17% gain from Monday\u2019s bottom.\n\nAlthough these gains are impressive, after Friday\u2019s close, longs in the market were still short of recapturing the key $1,800 level that is considered a prerequisite for the yellow metal regaining some bullish shine.\n\nNow, investors\u2019 attentions are focused on the Jackson Hole gathering in Wyoming. It is an annual retreat for the Fed to examine key strategies for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThere is high speculation that this year\u2019s event, scheduled between Aug 26 and 28, will discuss the tapering of the $120 billion in monthly stimulus that the central bank has been providing the economy since the Covid outbreak of March 2020.\n\nSpeculation about a stimulus taper has heightened since last week\u2019s upbeat U.S. jobs report for July that sent the dollar and U.S. bond yields rallying, which has an opposite effect on gold.\n\nGold appreciated by 0.44% while Silver dipped by -2.52% W-o-W.\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, pressured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Tapering policy and COVID-19 concerns in the market. Investors are advised to trade cautiously as the commodities market is very volatile at the moment.\n\nIn other precious metals, Silver is currently trading at $23.74 an ounce, down 2.25% for the week, platinum is back above the $1,000 trading zone to stand at $1,026.10, up 5.33% for the week and palladium is trading at $2,648.50, up 0.82% for the week.\n\nOil falls seven straight sessions in a row and tending towards 3-month lows\n\nOil prices were down by more than 1% on Monday, dropping for a straight third session as official data showed that refining throughput and economic activity taper down in China amidst fresh COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nIndian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd, a company that manages India\u2019s oil inventories, said it has begun selling oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to state-run refiners as it implements a new policy to commercialize its federal storage by leasing out space.\n\nOil prices fell for a seventh straight session on Friday towards three-month lows as investors became less bullish about fuel demand due to a surge in cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant that is hitting travel. Brent had a weekly decline of -7.02%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to dip further on COVID surge, worries about more supply.\n\nNBS economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 23rd August, 2021: Nigerian Capital Importation (Q2 2021) & Selected Banking Sector Data: Sectoral Breakdown of Credit, e-payment channels and Staff strength (Q2 2021).\n\n\u00b7 Thursday 26th August, 2021: Nigerian Gross Output by Product (Q2 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Friday 27th August, 2021: National Examination Council: Distribution of Results by State, Gender and Subject- 2020 & Telecoms Data: Active voice and Internet per State and Tariff information (Q2 2021).\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThe Naira continued its bearish run last week, at the BDC market and I & E FX window majorly attributed to the scarcity of FX.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the domestic currency depreciated by -0.21% on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis to close at N411.67/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nAgainst the US dollar at the BDC it closed at US$1/N517 depreciating by -0.78%, against the British pound it also fell by -1.48% to close at \u00a31/N708, and against the Euro by -1.00% to close at \u20ac1/N606.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.67 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.20.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nInterbank rates were elevated last week, as liquidity levels remained depressed causing rates to continue in its double digits trend.\n\nAt the close of the session on Friday, funding rates rose significantly. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 23.33% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 23.83% indicating a W-o-W rise of +39.28% for OBB and +38.14% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are still expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe T-bills market was mixed last week, with the yield in treasury bills edging upward while average benchmark yields for OMO bills fell at the close of trading for the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills rose by +0.33% to 4.69%, OMO bills declined by -22.24% W-o-W to close at 5.95%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill was flat to close at 5.66%.\n\nActivity in the coming week is expected to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Euro bond Market\n\nThe FGN bond market last week was also mixed as we saw buying interest at the mid and long end of the curve while sell interest was seen for short tenor notes.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 8.55% for the week which fell W-o-W by -0.28%.\n\nAt last week\u2019s bond auction, the DMO offered N150.00 billion worth of FGN FEB 2028, FGN MAR 2036 and FGN MAR 2050, with stop rates of 11.60%, 12.75% and 12.80%, respectively. The subscription stood at N360.02 billion, while N260.09 was allotted. The auction was oversubscribed by +140.01%.\n\nSelling was seen in the Eurobond market last week, as the global risk-off sentiment dampened activity in the market.\n\nWe expect the relatively quiet trend to persist in the near term.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a negative note with some with selling interest in stocks like MEYER. The NGXASI closed the week with a decline of -0.10%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N20.45bn, year-to-date return moderated to -1.96%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.57 trillion.\n\nThe volume of stocks traded on the exchange last week rose by +6.88% and the value declined by -1.06% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was bearish last week as the NGX Premium was the highest gainer for the week with +2.28% while NGX Mainboard and NGX Consumer Goods closed negative with -1.48% and -6.31% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week was positive with 36 gainers led by HONYFLOUR and PHARMDEKO as against 33 losers led by MEYER and SCOA.",

          "title": "Insecurity: Nigeria\u2019s gambit with \u2018repentant\u2019 Boko Haram",
          "text": "In what seems to be a curious case of two laws operating in Nigeria at the same time, the decision of the Federal Government to reintegrate what they termed \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram insurgents into the society while clamping down on those calling for self determination as a result of perceived marginalisation and injustice, has been flayed by men and women of good conscience.\n\nSome Nigerians have also described the move as playing with an Inland Taipan.\n\nThe Inland Taipan or famously known as \u2018fierce snake\u2019, has the most toxic venom in the world. It can yield as much as 110mg in one bite, which is enough to kill around 100 people or over 2.5 lakh mice. The venom consists of taipoxin, a complex mix of neurotoxins, procoagulants, and myotoxins.\n\nThe Nigerian Army had last Tuesday, through a statement by its Spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu announced that about 1000 Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (a Boko Haram splinter group), members had laid down their arms and surrendered to the troops.\n\nRead Also: FG not reabsorbing repentant Boko Haram members into the Army- Presidency\n\nIt said: \u201cAll surrendered terrorists will be received, processed and passed on to the relevant agencies of government for further assessment in line with extant provisions.\u201d\n\nAnother narrative was pushed out last week by Borno State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Home Affairs, Babakura Jatau, when he advised the host communities to accept the ex-fighters as one of them.\n\nThe Commissioner said the surrendering of the Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters might be the beginning of the end to the insurgency which the country and particularly the state had battled for over a decade.\n\n\u201cAt the end of every war, there is reconciliation. Every single war is not ended by the power of the bullet and bomb. They (insurgents) are part and parcel of us. They have surrendered; they are radicalised and they now realise their mistakes.\n\n\u201cRemember, we have been dealing with this problem for the past 13 years. For the past 13 years, the federation government has been battling with this insurgency without any peaceful resolution through firepower.\n\n\u201cThey voluntarily surrendered their arms. There is nothing to do but to accept them and appeal to members of the public to accept them so that they (ex-terrorists) can reintegrate into society because there are many of them in the bush,\u201d Jatau said.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria loses 3 soldiers, as army onslaught kills 75 Boko Haram insurgents\n\nFor 13 years running, the insurgents have been waging a low-grade war against the government and people of Nigeria, which has cost the country huge resources in monetary terms and uncountable number of casualties.\n\nSince its campaign to create an Islamic caliphate started around 2009, the Boko Haram sect has reportedly killed over 70,000 people and displaced about 2.5 million people, according to estimates by the International Crisis Group.\n\nOf the displaced, at least 250,000 have reportedly left Nigeria and fled into the neighbouring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger, though Borno State has started receiving some repatriated refugees from the countries.\n\nMilitary onslaught on the terrorists has reportedly led to the deaths of many of the insurgents, while some of them have also surrendered to the army.\n\nDuring this period of bloody campaign, families have been permanently dislocated and destroyed, some institutions have been wrecked and many innocent girls have remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe likes of Leah Sharibu and many others appeared to have been forgotten by government. A number of people were given slow deaths, while some others were brutally beheaded.\n\nThe atrocities of members of the sect cannot be captured in any single book.\n\nThese are the elements that the Federal Government termed \u201crepentant\u201d.\n\nIn the first place, most of them did not surrender themselves willingly to renounce their atrocious deeds; they were smoked out and arrested while in action and have been in the custody of the Federal Government.\n\nNow, fearing that they may be given a form of punishment for their crime against the state and humanity, they began to play the \u201crepentance card\u201d to hoodwink Abuja.\n\nJohn Henry, a concerned Nigerian, warned the Federal Government to be careful with its handling of the \u201crepentant\u201d members of the sect.\n\n\u201cAs a government, you can\u2019t be celebrating some Boko Haram members turning away from their act of terrorism. What happens to the people they killed; or those they rendered homeless and hopeless; what does it speak to the future act of other groups or people who will think that when they do such, their sins will be forgiven easily? Government needs to be very careful so that much more disaster is not coming ahead of us. Let\u2019s learn from Afghanistan,\u201d Henry said.\n\nGovernment must first ask Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State his experience with the terrorists he hurriedly baptised as \u201crepentant.\u201d The governor who was selling the idea of amnesty for bandits and terrorists was to later turn around to acknowledge that those who claimed to have turned a new leaf have gone back to the forest to continue with their dastardly acts.\n\nA report in April had it that the peace pact the Zamfara State government adopted to curb banditry suffered a heavy blow after a leader of the bandits reportedly returned to his old ways despite being forgiven.\n\nAuwal Daudawa, who was accused of spearheading the abduction of over 300 schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina State, has taken up arms again, just weeks after he claimed to have repented.\n\nIn February, the bandits\u2019 leader surrendered his arms, which included 20 AK 47 rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher, claiming he had repented.\n\nHe was received at the Zamfara State Government House where he announced that \u201cwe have voluntarily repented.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learnt from those who repented before me that there was no single plan by the governments through the use of security agencies to harm me and my boys, therefore, we are now back for normal lives like other peace-loving Nigerians,\u201d he had said.\n\nBut less than three months after he surrendered, Daudawa reportedly went back to Jaja forest.\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State captured the mindset of these elements when he said that there is no amount of carrot that can wean them off the evil trade having tasted that type of lifestyle.\n\nIt was on this basis that he has vehemently stood against ransom payment to kidnappers.\n\nOpposition mounts over reintegration plan\n\nAside being a manifestation of injustice on the part of the government, which usually uses the sledge hammer to crush other radical groups in other parts of the country, observers think that the regrettable action portends weakness, compromise and untrustworthy on the part of the government.\n\nThey think that if there are groups to pardon, it must never be Boko Haram because their nefarious actions, especially killings, have placed the country among the worst places to be on earth, scaring away foreign investors, as well as, local ones.\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, who has been following political and social unrests in Africa in the last two decades, the continued pardon of the notorious group is part of the reasons foreign countries are not willing to help Nigeria in the fight against insurgence.\n\nHe noted that the likes of UAE, China and even United States of America are killing terrorists openly and secretly, hence giving them no opportunity to thrive.\n\n\u201cIf you notice, European countries are safer these days from terrorists because they have started adopting the killing approach, especially secretly,\u201d Onikoyi said.\n\nFor killing innocent Nigerians, Bulus Yohanna, director, African Justice Roundtable, an Abuja-based human right organisation, insisted that the terrorists should die and not pardoned.\n\n\u201cIf you pardon them; what about those they killed and their families that are suffering because of their loss? There should be justice for them,\u201d he said.\n\nAngry at the pardon idea, the Plateau State-born lawyer questioned the need for the six fighter jets the country acquired recently, when government is releasing and pardoning jailed terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt is counterproductive because others are encouraged to kill more people and when they are caught and jailed, they know they will be released soon by the government, which should rather exterminate them,\u201d he said.\n\nTerfa Hemba, a Kaduna-based lawyer, who lost a sister during the Abuja bombing by Boko Haram few years ago, said that the citizens should challenge such decisions in the court because the law offers opportunity for such, especially when it will endanger people\u2019s lives, peace and economic activities.\n\n\u201cIf the pardoning has resulted in less killings by Boko Haram, then one can argue on behalf of the Nigerian government, but it has rather encouraged more killings. In the international modalities for treating terrorists, it is death in their hideout or death by installment in jail. They are all linked and have never changed in any country they operate,\u201d Hemba pointed out.\n\nHe blamed the conquest of more towns by Boko Haram on the soft approach to the fight by government and the regrettable pardon.\n\n\u201cYou cannot leave a university fraternity or secular cult without being hunted by former members. These terrorists have more than blood oath binding them, they cannot repent from killing, they know the group\u2019s hideout, where to get arms and contacts. It is a shame that the government is playing soft now that it is time to fight to finish,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also argued that if northern groups are opposing it, then the pardon is better suspended.\n\n\u201cHave you heard Arewa Consultative Forum\u2019s fierce stand on the pardon? It is not in the interest of the north, their people are being killed and government seems unconcerned. But I think, it should go beyond mere condemnation to actions like mass protests against it,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nComparing pardon with amnesty, Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, said those who argue that if Niger Delta militants can be offered amnesty, then bandits and terrorists should also be pardoned, do not have the interest of the country at heart.\n\nAccording to the retired officer: \u201cIf you go after a group for asking for more from the natural resources in their area, then what about those who go about killing people in the name of religion; what if a group from a different religion rises up tomorrow, how can you stop them when another thrives?\u201d\n\nHe thinks that the government should declare a war against these terror groups and \u201cin war you kill and not pardon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you pardon repentant Boko Haram, you should also pardon repentant bandits, kidnappers and every convict in the prison who claims to have repented. Yes, because it will be injustice when those who commit no or lesser crime are held behind the bars when bloodsucking vampires are set free,\u201d he said.\n\nMost observers fear that the so-called repentant Boko Haram members may regroup after the pardon and that it may also be a strategy by the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cWhoever kills another, should be killed or given life imprisonment; that is what the Nigerian law says. So, why pardon a killer for showing remorse, when those he killed cannot come back to life? Justice is justice,\u201d they unanimously concluded.\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), pan-northern socio-political organisation, urged government to rather prosecute the \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram members for the crimes committed against fellow Nigerians.\n\nReacting on behalf of ACF, Audu Ogbeh, national chairman and a former minister of Agriculture, in a statement he personally signed and released by the National Publicity Secretary of the forum, Emmanuel Yawe in Kaduna, said such a move would be disastrous.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018On repentant Boko Haram terrorists and the principle of equity and justice,\u2019\n\nACF said: \u201cWe are currently witnessing large scale surrender of large numbers of Boko Haram insurgents, among whom are bomb makers, commanders, arsonists, rapists, and child snatchers.\n\n\u201cDo we have good reason to cheer and hope for an end to this decade-old insanity? Is \u2018I am sorry\u2019 enough to bring relief to Nigerians and the thousands of dead and maimed? What of those victims bombed in the churches, mosques, schools, and markets? What of all the men and women in uniform murdered by them?\n\n\u201cWho can count the thousands of widows and orphans they have created? And what is the difference between them and the Igbohos or ESN of Nigeria? None.\u201d\n\nThe group doubted the genuineness of the \u201crepentance\u201d, saying: \u201cSo, what do we do with them? Should we just embrace them and trust them wholesale? Are their moves informed by altruistic repentance? We seriously doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe join the Governor of Borno, the Shehu of Borno, Senator Ndume and millions of Nigerians in pondering over this development and our simple advice is, bring them to trial, or free all others presently in custody anywhere, while we Nigerians plead guilty of naivety and gullibility in the extreme, punishable by more insurrection and anarchy,\u201d it further said.\n\nBy the same token, the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were said to have expressed anger over the plan by the Borno State government to reintegrate 1,000 of the insurgents.\n\nThey were said to have complained that they are still languishing in pain, sorrow and forced poverty foisted on them by the murderous activities of the sect.\n\nMany of them said they lost their husbands, wives, parents, children, relations, homes and means of livelihood, which was the reason they are still at the IDPs\u2019 camp and wondered the justification for rewarding those who had inflicted serious and permanent pain on them.\n\nMark Adebayo, spokesman for the Coalition of Registered political Parties (CUPP), expressed doubts over the sincerity of the terrorists, while condemning government\u2019s decision to reintegrate them into the society.\n\nAdebayo warned President Buhari that the move may just be an attempt by the terrorists to infiltrate the society, gather intelligence and relaunch.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is an initiative to reward violent criminal elements who have caused so much pains and disasters in the country. It is a development that the country will later regret but it may be too late by then.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is that these terrorists who pretend to have repented are spies sent to infiltrate the society, gather intelligence and relaunch a more disastrous attack on the society. I very much doubt their sincerity and willingness to stop their terroristic inclinations.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in the history of terrorism where such large numbers of terrorists as we have witnessed recently would be allowed to escape from the terrorists\u2019 camps and some even with their victims forcefully raped and married and the children they had together. And all escaped with their illegitimate families without being detected by the Boko Haram high command? It can\u2019t happen! They are deliberately being released into the society to execute a hidden agenda that would later devastate the country.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cUnfortunately, the government is too n\u00e4ive to see that and take serious precautions on the situation. The government is too accommodating and patronising with these hardened terrorists. The USA made the same mistakes of releasing some detained terrorists years back who later became the main nucleus of ISIS that became the strongest ever terrorist organisation in the world that brazenly seized territories bigger than France in Syria and Iraq and it took considerable international military onslaughts to quell their unprecedented assaults on humanity.\n\n\u201cA Nigerian Army General once said a repentant Boko Haram member stands a chance to become Nigeria\u2019s president. With a dangerous mindset like that at the top levels of government and the military, little wonder Nigeria is not winning the war against terrorism. How can the government be this tolerant of terrorists? It is ultimately counterproductive, unreasonable and absolutely thoughtless.\u201d\n\nTaoffik Gani, spokesman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, faulted the decision, advising government to be watchful of the identities of the terrorists who are surrendering.\n\n\u201cIt is a wrong move by the government or whoever is doing this thing. How can you bring back guys that have been killings, maiming and raping Nigerians for a decade now back to the same society they had committed these atrocities? I don\u2019t know but how do you think the people would accept them back?\n\n\u201cFor me, I even think this people are not the real Boko Haram, because for the real Boko Haram it would be very difficult for them to surrender. I think they are their foot soldiers who are lured to surrender by their collaborators in government so don\u2019t be surprise,\u201d Gani said.\n\nNigeria must beware the Afghanistan episode\n\nAlso, a current Affairs Analyst, Kunle Okunade said the development portends a dangerous development because Boko Haram terrorists could not be compared to ordinary criminals because they had been very destructive.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe reintegration might be dangerous considering the fact that they might not well being deradicalised for the purported reintegration. The first thing the government needs to strategically do is \u2018total deradicalisation\u2019 of the terrorists because if this is to be done appropriately and outright, Nigeria may end up experiencing what occurred in Afghanistan recently.\n\n\u201cAnother fact is that the Boko Haram insurgents can\u2019t be equated with common criminals because the insurgents have been ideologically indoctrinated and stereotyped by the top echelon of their movement who are the intellectual engine room of their battle.\n\n\u201cSo, if government believes the insurgents had been taken through the same rehabilitation process experienced by common criminals in the correction centres and believe that the insurgents have been reborn and be allowed to be reintegrated and co-habit with Nigerians, it might be making a serious mistake in the long run. Insurgency is more of terrorism than economic crime which many common criminals are rehabilitated against.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow does the government know that the rehabilitated Boko Haram members would not go back to their terror acts? At what point do they believe the insurgents have a genuine change of mind, and now have the mindset to co-habit with the people?\n\n\u201cFor me, the government should be very careful in the reintegration of the jailed insurgents into the society because it might boomerang if it turns out that the insurgents have not been properly and total deradicalised\u201d.",

          "text": "A former candidate for the House of Representatives seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Chief Tony Okocha, has denied plans to dump the party for the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP).\n\nOkocha, who was Chief of Staff to former Governor Rotimi Amaechi, disclosed this while speaking with LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.\n\nHe stated that even though he has been attending state functions, especially the commissioning of projects based on the invitation of the state government, he has no plans to dump the party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u201cI am sure you know that Wike is governor of Rivers State and not governor of PDP. I have attended state government events because I am a stakeholder in the state, especially commissioning of projects. I have attended quiet a lot on invitation.\n\n\u201cThere is no plan to join the PDP. It is a personal thing. If I wanted to port for the PDP, that would have been long done. I was part of building of the APC. My life and that of my family members were put on the line. So, I don\u2019t think I want to leave the party in a hurry for anybody. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nOkocha, who described himself as a founding member of the APC in the state, said the issue of joining the APC in 2014 was a collective decision.\n\n\u201cIn Rivers State, you can see that from 2015 till now, the state has been under the governance of the Peoples Democratic Party, which is the party that was removed from office at the centre and the circumstances that led to that are well-known to a good number of us here.\n\n\u201cNow, in 2015, we lost it and the argument that we made and keep and keep making is that the military brought in the jackboots and the federal apparati. That is the argument as far as we are concerned. I was a candidate for Obio/Akpor federal constituency.\n\n\u201cThe President then was PDP but he couldn\u2019t use the federal might to deliver himself. Okay, let\u2019s say they used the federal might here for whatever reasons and nobody can contemplate it. Then, what happened in 2019?\n\n\u201cThe issue of joining the APC was collectively resolved because somebody has to be at the centre. All of us agreed that it was going to be the best of all decisions,\u201d Okocha stated.",

Our people now want a leader with practicable ideas and dynamism to move the state forward. Ideas that will proffer sustainable solutions to the socio-economic problems beclouding the state due to bad governance brought to the fore by the present government.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I am challenging Prof. Soludo to an open public manifesto debate with me.

I wish to implore every one of us to do the right thing with respect to ensuring that our campaigns are bereft of calumny and conducted in a proper and sane manner. I am assured that such a move will further solidify our democracy and entrench purposeful narratives that will change the tide of our polity positively,\u201d Ubah added.

          "text": "Presiding Bishop, Living Faith Worldwide, David Oyedepo has banned youths with earphones from entering the church as they are not ready to hear God\u2019s words.\n\nOyedepo said they should go somewhere else, as the church would not tolerate youths who are not ready to listen to the words of God.\n\nSpeaking during a church service on Sunday, Oyedepo lamented that \u201cWe live in a very rowdy time. Young generation, please listen to me: all these things you plug in your ear is to block your way forward. It is designed by the devil to block your way forward. \u201cNo time to hear from God. Many have never heard anything from God. They even plug it in anywhere, on the streets: noise, noise, noise! Zero access to divine guidance. Noise in the morning, afternoon, night.\n\n\u201cWe had a situation in South Korea, I saw it in one publication. Now 10,000 Churches were said to close down within 10 years, an average of 1,000 Churches per year. Why? Children, young people will sit down in Church (with earphones): don\u2019t hear nothing Sir. \u201cIn fact Service would end, we were told and they won\u2019t know until they look around and see there is nobody around. Then they will leave. It is as terrible as that. The devil wants to destroy the fate of the future generation. Very soon, he wants to wipe away the Bible hard copy from your hand so you can be browsing nonsense even in Church. Nonsense in Church,\u201d he lamented. According to Oyedepo, \u201cyou will think they are writing what you are saying? No. I was in the Church 1976 and the Priest was reading from John 6:48-58, as if I was hearing from Jesus. Church has power. \u201cI am that Bread of life\u201d \u2013 as if I was on that mountain where Jesus was teaching.",

Israel Akanji said God would help free the 63 others still in captivity.\n\nThe parents\u2019 joy however knew no bound Sunday when they were reunited with their children, kidnapped from their boarding school in the early hours of July 5, 2021.\n\nBlueprint recalled that the bandits broke into the school located at Damishi along the Kaduna \u2013 Kachia highway, Chikun local government area of the state and whisked away 121 students.\n\nThe kidnappers released 28 of the students, Sunday, July 25 after receiving N50 million ransom and later released few others on health ground, while some escaped on their own leaving 78 students in captivity.\n\nThe bandits thereafter made fresh demand of N80 million ransom to release the remaining 78 students in captivity.\n\nAlthough Blueprint reliably gathered that ransom was paid for release of the 15 students, the amount could not be established as at the time of this report.\n\nHanding over the children to their parents at the Baptist secretariat along Ahmadu Bello way, Rev. Akanji said they expected the bandits to release all the remaining 78 students.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to God for the release of these 15 children. Although the number is smaller than what we expected, because we had 78 out there; they have given us 15, that means 63 to come, but in everything, God said we should give thanks and we are grateful for what He has done. And we are trusting that the same God will help us to receive the remaining 63.\n\n\u201cWe have great hope in God and we will keep praying and keep asking God for help. We do not know why they did not release all the children; we were really expecting all the children, but these are the ones we have.

          "text": "Muslim communities in the crisis ridden Jos North local government area of Plateau state Sunday rose from a stakeholders\u2019 meeting with a promise to give necessary cover to churches in their areas.\n\nThey said the decision became imperative as stakeholders had realised some politicians were using religion to achieve their selfish ends.\n\nThe meeting was an aftermath of the killing of some Muslim faithful of Ondo state origin returning from Bauchi state where they had gone to attend an Islamic function, but attacked in Jos by some miscreants.\n\nAlso last Friday, the state\u2019s deputy governor, Mr Sunny Tyoden, led a high-power delegation to Ondo state where they handed over 49 survivors of the attack, and also sought for forgiveness from the Ondo people.\n\nResolutions\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 after the peace parley at the conference hall of Jos Central Mosque, the meeting called for peace and resolved to support efforts at achieving a return to normalcy in the state.\n\nThe meeting was at the instance of Jasawa Community Development Association (JCDA), an umbrella body of Hausa and Fulani Muslims of Jos.\n\nAddressing journalists after the parley, JCDA National President Shehu Ibrahim Masallah said this became necessary following the recent killing of some 28 travellers around Gada-biyu-Rukuba Road.\n\nIn a nine-point communiqu\u00e9 read by its national secretary, Alhaji Aminu Mato, the meeting agreed to protect all churches in the area.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have resolved to protect all Churches within Muslim communities. It is our resolve that nobody should, should destroy, burn or vandalise any church within us. This is so because we have realized that some politicians are using this kind of opportunity to achieve their surreptitious objectives knowing full well that religion is very sensitive.\n\n\u201cThis will go a long way to preventing further occurrence of crisis in Jos and its environs. We have equally resolved that vigilante groups within our domains will work and assist the security agencies to ensure peace and harmony within Jos and its environs and agreed that anybody caught attacking innocent citizens or causing trouble will be handed over to the security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further urged the state government to be proactive before a crisis escalates in any community and ensure justice for the aggrieved.\n\n\u201cWe urge parents to ensure adequate and proper monitoring of their children and ward\u2019s. We all resolved that the issues of school dropouts amongst our youths and jobless amongst them will be looked into aim at reducing the menace of criminality.\n\n\u201cWe will liaise with the necessary agency of government to also ensure rehabilitation of those youths that engaged themselves into illicit drugs,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nIn attendance at the parley were religious and community leaders within and outside Jos, as well as other stakeholders.\n\nOgun evacuates students\n\nIn a related development, amidst the rising threat to lives and property in Plateau state, the Ogun state government has evacuated University of Jos (UNIJOS) students who are of the state origin.\n\nThe killing of scores of travellers, including four students with many injured in Jos by suspected hoodlums, forced UNIJOS management to suspend the ongoing second-semester examination for the 2019/2020 academic session.\n\nSpecial Assistant to the governor on students\u2019 affairs, Mr Azeez Adeyemi announced this while speaking to journalists in Abeokuta Sunday.\n\nAdeyemi said Governor Dapo Abiodun provided five buses and security escorts to ensure the safe return of the stranded students.\n\nHe said the evacuation was carried out in conjunction with relevant stakeholders including security agencies, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and the National Association of Ogun State Students (NAOSS).\n\n\u201cIn line with the policy of Governor Dapo Abiodun on the protection of lives and property of every Ogun State indigene, the Governor has ordered the immediate evacuation of all the indigenes of the State studying in the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis followed the crisis which erupted as a result of the killings of four students of the institution.\n\n\u201cWe have provided five buses and security escorts to bring our children back home safely.\n\n\u201cNo indigene of this State will be allowed to suffer or be abandoned irrespective of their political or religious affiliation. They are Ogun people and it is our duty to ensure their safety,\u201d Adeyemi said.\n\nAlso speaking, NAOSS President Oluwagbemileke Ogunrombi said the state officials had already evacuated about 80 students and some corps members who are indigenes of the state from the trouble areas.\n\n\u201cWe requested for two buses, but the state government magnanimously released five buses, not only buses but with a military escort. So, the students have been evacuated and taken to a safe haven.\n\n\u201cAs at last time, we spoke with the team, about 80 students have been evacuated. Then, they said some Corp members are also joining them,\u201d Ogunrombi said.\n\nASUU decries attacks\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Jos chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has condemned the attacks and killing of students and members of the university community during most civil unrests in Jos.\n\nUNIJOS ASUU Chairman Lazarus Maigoro said this in a statement Sunday in Jos.\n\nMaigoro described the recent attacks on students of university as \u201csad and unfortunate.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cASUU in University of Jos, with serious concern and sadness wishes to bring to the notice of the general public the recent developments in and around Jos and how it has impacted negatively on the University.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered untold damages in relation to loss of lives and property, in addition to the regular suspension of academic activities each time there is a security breach in Jos and as a union, we have tried to understand how the university community is always at the receiving end of each crisis in Jos.\n\n\u201cIn spite of all the provocations, we have continued to offer community service to all, irrespective of religion, culture and tribe; the university administration has over the years made overtures to host communities in terms of undergraduate admissions and staff employment, yet our students and staff are killed at the slightest provocation, however far the epicentre of the crisis from the institution.\n\n\u201cThe University is a citadel of learning which houses various categories of people regardless of ethnic and religious affiliations, as such, should be spared anytime there is breach of security in other parts of Jos.\n\nHe also expressed worry that the suspension of academic activities and closure of the school would pose a serious setback to the students\u2019 academic sojourn.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing examinations have been suspended and the students are asked to go home thereby abruptly destabilising the semester and the academic session in general.\n\n\u201cThis equally means longer stay in school for the students in the face of current harsh economic realities in the country.\n\n\u201dAs teachers, our hearts go out to these students, particularly families who lost their loved ones.\n\n\u201cThey are equally our children and no parent will want his child killed because he went to the University to acquire a degree.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU leader called on the government and security agencies to intensify efforts and end the circle of violence in the state, particularly in the rural areas.\n\nMaigoro further appealed to the government to deploy more security personnel to the university to ensure the safety of its staff and students.\n\nHe advised the government to compensate all those who suffered any loss during the recent attacks and ensure justice for the dead.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Acting Vice Chancellor of University, Gray Ejikeme, had confirmed the killing of a student of the university in the recent attacks in Jos, adding that investigations were ongoing to ascertain the real state of things.\n\nMr Ejikeme, however, promised to make available detailed information on the number of students killed and those injured during the recent attacks.

By virtue of the ritual, the OSU was regarded as one that was cursed, abominable, and untouchable.

          "title": "APC crisis: Will leadership hammer fall on 100 members who sue party?",
          "text": "ome aggrieved members numbering one hundred approached a federal high court sitting in Abuja to seek the dissolution of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Co\u00f1vention Planning Committee, CECPC, headed by Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe plaintiffs, through their lawyer, Barr. Samuel E. Irabor, asked the court to declare the 13-man caretaker committee illegal, and to nullify all activities so far presided over by it including the recently conducted ward congresses.\n\nThey contended that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs added that the headship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC constitution. It is also the contention of the plaintiffs that Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer oath of office to Mr Buni as caretaker chairman of the party. The plaintiffs argued that only the National Working Committee of the party could constitute a Caretaker Committee as provided under Article 13(4)(xvi) of the APC Constitution. Listed as co-defendant in the originating summon registered as Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, are the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and others.\n\nThe row over the status of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has for a while threatened the fragile peace within the ruling party. While disgruntled factions of the APC hold that there is a flaw in having Governor Mai Mala Buni remain as Chairman of the CECPC, others argue that there is no constitutional breach in having a serving governor lead the party at the moment. In a recent communique aimed at making clear its position on the controversy over the legality of the CECPC and that of its chairman, the APC stated that \u201con both issues, we will state the position and decision of the Supreme Court only. The decision here is the majority judgment of the Supreme Court which is now the Law. \u201cThe decision and judgment was read and concurred to by the justices who were in the majority. Any other statements in their various additional contributions by the justices complement the lead judgment. \u201cIt is therefore right to say that the issues and ratio in the lead judgment reflect the views of the majority. The minority judgment, although important as it is, is not the judgment of the court.\u201d The statement further notes that the Supreme Court in its judgment affirmed the legality of the CECPC, adding: \u201cthe court stated that the NEC under Article 13 (3) IV of the APC constitution has power to create, elect and appoint a committee and endow it with powers and functions. It drew a parallel with Article 33(3) of PDP constitution (2012) with similar powers granted to its National Convention which in turn appointed a National Caretaker in 2016, which the Supreme Court ruled legal in Sheriff VS PDP. \u201cOn the status of the Acting National Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Supreme Court held that he was appointed only in acting capacity, on temporary basis to carry out and fill in the seat of the National Chairman, pending the election of new officers. \u201cThe Apex Court also held that Mai Mala Buni\u2019s position as Acting Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is not contrary to the provision of Section 183 of the CFRN because the appointment, ad-hoc, is on a temporary basis which is not akin to Executive office or paid employment as envisaged by Section 183 of the CFRN.\u201d \ufffc The latest court suit came barely three weeks after a minority judgement of the Supreme court which questioned the eligibility of Mai Mala Buni, as the CECPC chairman triggered flurry of legal opinions, interpretations as well as implications of the judgement on the fortune of the ruling party in future elections.\n\nInterestingly, the plaintiffs action is in defiance of a directive issued by the National Executive Committee of the APC at its emergency meeting of December 8, 2020, in which it directed all members who have instituted one case or the other against the party in a law court to withdraw such and further warned others not to sue the party until all internal mechanism for conflict resolution are completely exhausted.\n\nThe APC leadership vowed to dish out maximum punishment to offenders in accordance with its constitutional provisions. Similarly, the national leadership of the party, in a statement issued on July 30, 2021, had threatened to wield the big stick on any of its members who takes the party to court without first exhausting all available internal mechanism of reconciliation to address their grievances.\n\nRecall that APC NEC had at its December 8 emergency meeting expelled former National Vice Chairman, South-South, Hilliard Eta, for challenging the dissolution of the immediate past National Working Committee, NWC, by the National Executive Committee, NEC, in the courts against party directives.\n\nChief Etta, and some other members of the dissolved National Working Committee, NWC, of the party, had approached a Federal High Court in Abuja, to ask for the nullification of the June 25, 2020 APC NEC meeting which dissolved the NWC. The questions being asked now is whether or not the 100 aggrieved members who defied the party\u2019s warning to institute a court suit would suffer a similar fate to Chief Hilliard Eta.\n\nAnswering questions from journalists in this regard on behalf of the party, APC chieftain, Chief Patrick Obahiagbon, alluded that that the party\u2019s constitution dictated that punishment for erring members can only be initiated from the ward, local government to the State before the national headquarters can sanction such members.\n\nObahiagbon said, \u201cThe APC has party Constitution and the party Constitution is quite clear on issues that has to do with the necessity of members of this political party to exhaust all domestic remedies. As to what the sanction would be, for any member of this party who has fallen short of respecting the party Constitution not only with regards to taking the CECPC to Court. The constitutional provision to the effect that disciplinary sanctions will have to start from the Ward of such members. Disciplinary actions will have to go to the local government, states before it comes to the National Secretariat.\n\n\u201cSo the CECPC will not by itself discipline any member of the political party that has not been (sanctioned) from Ward, local government, state and to National Secretariat. But all I can tell you is that when all such activities have passed through the democratic rigours and get to the National Secretariat, this CECPC under the able leadership of Governor Mai-Mala Buni, he will not shake in his responsibility, his constitutional onus probandi, will dispense justice to all manners of men without fear or favour and in a very transparent modus.\u201d\n\nThe only organ of the party that can unilaterally sanction erring members is the NEC which is presently unconstituted as it was dissolved at its last meeting.\n\nAs it stands, no one knows what will become the fate of these members or what the reaction of the party to the litigation would be.\n\nThe party, however, seem unperturbed or distracted by the development as it has directed that its local government congress go ahead as scheduled.\n\nIn a notice of guidelines and schedule of events released by the party last week, the APC fixed its local government congress for Saturday 4th September, 2021 while sales of forms has commenced with immediate effect.\n\nAccording to the notice signed by the CECPC Secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, Purchase of Forms for Ward, Local Government/Area Councils and State Congresses will hold between18th August to 28th August, 2021.",

We also firmly believe that Ganduje\u2019s antecedents as Governor of Kano make him the perfect Northern vice presidential candidate to Osinbajo; one who will advance and protect the interests of a Northern Nigeria plagued by poverty and insecurity.\u201d\n\nMost political pundits believe that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is quietly nursing a Presidential ambition, while Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, whose tenure ends in 2023, has publicly expressed his support for a Southern President.\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) i s most likely to zone its Presidential candidate to the South of Nigeria, after eight years of Buhari and based on a purported gentleman understanding reached between the founding members of APC in 2014.\n\nKano in North West Nigeria is renowned for its politics, and boasts of the largest voter turn-out figures in Nigeria. Lagos, Osinbajo\u2019s political alma mater, has arguably become the hub of political influence and activity in the South of Nigeria.\n\nAs concerns around Tinubu\u2019s health and age have grown, there is mounting opposition to Tinubu\u2019s ambition within the APC; and more politicians and pundits in the South are beginning to talk and play up the prospects of younger Turks within the APC like Prof. Osinbajo, Gov. Kayode Fayemi and the former governor of Lagos Babatunde Fashola (SAN).\n\nGov. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, a PhD holder in Public Administration who served then defeated his erstwhile political godfather Gov. Rabiu Kwankwaso, belongs to a moderate group in the APC and North that believes the next President of Nigeria should come from the South.\n\nPairing a sitting Vice President from the second largest voting zone in Nigeria with a governor from the largest voting zone in the country could be a political masterstroke for votes in 2023.\n\nHowever, as the APC appears to have conceded that power rotates to the south, and as consensus grows around Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy, it is anticipated that the contest for the Vice presidential slot amongst Northern APC politicians will start to assume center stage.\n\nDespite the fact that the campaign posters are very conspicuous in public places near the presidential villa, no official reactions have come from the Vice President\u2019s or Governor\u2019s offices.",

          "text": "Niger Delta Youths, under the auspices of Anioma Youth Forum Worldwide, have stated that the recent signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill into law may spark new unrest in the region, calling it as an aberration to the oil-rich region.\n\nThis comes as the Defence Headquarters stated that the military was prepared to prevent a breakdown in law and order in the region.\n\nAfter more than 20 years of turmoil, President Buhari signed the PIB into law on Monday.\n\nHowever, the forum\u2019s National President, Nnamdi Ofonye, said that the Federal Government\u2019s inaction could spark a new agitation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will collectively take a stand in our meeting today (Sunday). In as much as the eventual signing of the bill into law is one that all of Niger Delta has been craving, unfortunately, it didn\u2019t turn out to be what we expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe three per cent is still a far cry from what we thought, and this goes to show that our representatives do not take our plight to heart because if the bill that was just signed was presented for the general well-being of the people, it wouldn\u2019t have generated controversy.\n\n\u201cIf the generality of the Niger Delta is against the bill, I see no reason why our lawmakers did not stop it at the National Assembly. This is what we always got because when we ask for the constituency briefing, they don\u2019t see it as anything but a waste of time.\n\n\u201cWe have cried to them about what we want but most of them went to support the bill against the wishes of the people. They have failed us.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta will renew its agitation. In fact, there have been some threats in some quarters. But we, the youth of the Niger Delta, are networking and speaking among ourselves to know what next to do.\n\n\u201cI do not want to pre-empt any group now, but currently, we are all planning to meet to review the so-called law. So far so good, the law has not gone down well with the youth of the Niger Delta. We will make our position known soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the Director of Defence Information, Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, in an interview advised anyone aggrieved with the law to seek means other than violence to seek redress.\n\nHe added \u201cThe military is ready at all times to address the issue of security concerns. We have all it takes to ensure that the peace and stability enjoyed in the Niger Delta remains and keep everyone secured.\n\n\u201cI believe they will resolve whatever their grievances are and it won\u2019t degenerate into any crisis. However, we are always prepared to ensure there is peace in every nook and cranny of the country.\u201d\n\nHe nevertheless warned that the military would not allow anyone to interrupt the peace being enjoyed by the people of the region over the signing of the PIB into law by the President.",

          "title": "US: Tropical Storm Henri Makes Landfall in Rhode Island",
          "text": "Tropical Storm Henri made landfall in Rhode Island early Sunday, packing heavy winds and drenching rains as it began lashing the northeastern U.S. coastline.\n\nTropical Storm Henri steamed toward the northeastern U.S. coastline Sunday morning, packing high winds and heavy rains that were projected to leave a wide swath of devastation from New Jersey and New York to Massachusetts.\n\nThe storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm but still packed wind gusts of up to 75 mph. Officials warned of the danger of widespread flooding in inland areas as the storm was expected to sweep west from the coast before turning back to the Northeast.\n\nMillions on New York\u2019s Long Island and in southern New England braced for the possibility of flooding, toppled trees and extended power outages. Residents up and down the coast hoped to be spared the storm\u2019s wrath but prepared for the worst.\n\nDriving surf and sheets of rain scoured the beach towns of southern Rhode Island as the storm approached, leaving some coastal roads nearly impassable. Some small trees had already fallen to the winds and rain, which had swollen local inlets and creeks.\n\nWesterly resident Collette Chisholm, a 20-year resident, said the waves were much higher than normal, but said she wasn\u2019t concerned about her home suffering extensive damage.\n\n\u201cI love storms,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re exciting, as long as no one gets hurt.\u201d\n\nIn Newport, Paul and Cherie Saunders were riding out the storm in a home that her family has owned since the late 1950s. Their basement flooded with 5 feet of water during Superstorm Sandy nine years ago.\n\n\u201cThis house has been through so many hurricanes and so many things have happened,\u201d Cherie Saunders, 68, said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe storm had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported Sunday morning, just shy of hurricane status. The highest winds measured were 75 mph (121 kph) off the coast of Rhode Island.\n\nExperts warned that the storm\u2019s biggest threat likely won\u2019t come from wind but from storm surge and inland flooding, caused by what are expected to be heavy and sustained rains. Some of the highest rain totals were expected inland.\n\nIn one of his final appearances as governor before he is set to step down at the end of Monday over a sexual harassment scandal, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that with the threat to Long Island diminishing, the state\u2019s primary concern were inland areas like the Hudson River Valley, north of New York City, which was projected to get inches of rain over the next few days.\n\nRainfall in the Catskills \u201cis a significant problem,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIn the Hudson Valley you have hills, you have creeks, the water comes running down those hills and turns a creek into a ravaging river. I have seen small towns in these mountainous areas devastated by rain. That is still a very real possibility.\u201d\n\nTroy Buckner of Southampton, in eastern Long Island\u2019s Hamptons, wouldn\u2019t let the storm interrupt his near-daily routine of getting coffee with his dad at the Golden Pear, one of the few spots open on Main Street Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cToday we thought we\u2019d still try to keep a little bit of normalcy, but we\u2019re heading back home for the remainder,\u201d Buckner said as the rain pelted down. \u201cWe plan for the worst. You just never know. We always anticipate Southampton could be the center, the bull\u2019s eye.\u201d\n\nA lack of major roadways on the eastern end of Long Island makes mass evacuations untenable, East Hampton Mayor Jerry Larsen said.\n\n\u201cWe have one lane of travel leaving the Hamptons so it\u2019s a little difficult to order evacuations,\u201d Larsen told The Associated Press. \u201cSo most people will shelter in place and, God willing, everyone will come through this OK.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the storm, officials in Providence, Rhode Island, and New Bedford, Massachusetts, closed giant hurricane barriers that were built in the 1960s, after devastating storms in 1938 and 1954.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 Steamship Authority canceled all Sunday ferry service between the mainland and the popular vacation islands of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket after the U.S. Coast Guard shut down ports on Cape Cod and New Bedford. Tourists waiting in their cars, hoping for a last-minute ferry off the islands, were stranded until the worst of Henri passes.\n\nThe first thunderstorms bringing what could be up to half a foot (15 centimeters) of rain arrived late Saturday, and flash flooding began in some areas overnight. Bands of heavy rain overwhelmed storm drains and drivers plowed through foot-deep water in a few spots in New York City, and Newark and Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nGov. Ned Lamont warned Connecticut residents they should prepare to \u201cshelter in place\u201d from Sunday afternoon through at least Monday morning as the state braces for the first possible direct hit from a hurricane in decades. Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee issued a similar warning.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declared disasters in much of the region, opening the purse strings for federal recovery aid. The White House said Biden discussed preparations with northeastern governors and that New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who succeeds Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday, also participated.\n\nMajor airports in the region remained open as the storm approached, though hundreds of Sunday\u2019s flights were canceled. Service on some branches of New York City\u2019s commuter rail system was suspended through Sunday, as was Amtrak service between New York and Boston.\n\nNew York hasn\u2019t had a direct hit from a powerful cyclone since Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc in 2012. Some of the most important repairs from that storm have been completed, but many projects designed to protect against future storms remain unfinished.\n\nRegardless of its exact landfall, broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the Northeast, extending inland to Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, and eastward to Cape Cod, which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists.\n\nStorm surge between 3 and 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) was possible in much of Long Island Sound all the way to Chatham, Massachusetts, and slightly less on Long Island\u2019s Atlantic coast, the hurricane center said. Flash flooding was possible in inland areas already saturated by recent rain.",

          "text": "Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah ran the second fastest women\u2019s 100m of all time at the Eugene Diamond League.\n\nThe Jamaican, who retained her 100m-200m title double in Tokyo, clocked a new world lead of 10.54 seconds.\n\nOnly American Florence Griffith-Joyner has run faster, when she set her world record of 10.49 secs in 1988.\n\nBritain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith finished third in the 200m as she continues her return from the hamstring injury that blighted her Olympic campaign.\n\nThe race was won by Switzerland\u2019s Mujinga Kambundji, with American Gabrielle Thomas finishing 0.08 secs ahead of world champion Asher-Smith.\n\nIn the 100m, Thompson-Herah\u2019s Jamaican compatriots Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson were second and third respectively in a repeat of the Tokyo podium.\n\nAmerican Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, who missed the Olympics because of a one-month suspension after testing positive for marijuana, finished last.\n\n\u201cIt was a great return back to the sport,\u201d the 21-year-old said. \u201cI wanted to be able to come and perform. Having the month off, dealing with all I had to deal with, I\u2019m not upset with myself at all.\n\n\u201cThis is one race, I\u2019m not done. You know what I\u2019m capable of. Count me out if you want to, because I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d\n\nEarlier this season, Fraser-Pryce ran 10.63 secs to become the second fastest woman in history behind Griffith-Joyner, only to see her time usurped by 29-year-old Thompson-Herah with 10.61 secs as she retained her Olympic title in Tokyo.\n\nOlympic stars shine in Eugene\n\nRecords tumbled in all corners of the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, with Olympic medallists continuing their fine form back on the Diamond League tour.\n\nTokyo bronze medallist Andre de Grasse won the men\u2019s 100m in 9.74 secs, with Americans Fred Kerley \u2013 the Olympic silver medal winner \u2013 and Ronnie Baker crossing the line in second and third.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200m, American Olympic bronze medallist Noah Lyles set a new meeting record and world lead of 19.52 secs.\n\nAthing Mu followed up her women\u2019s 800m gold in Tokyo with victory in the non-Diamond League event in Eugene, setting a new world lead of one minute 55.04 secs in a race that saw Britain\u2019s Olympic silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson place fifth and Jemma Reekie eighth.\n\nNorway\u2019s Olympic 1500m champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen was victorious over one mile in a new world leading time of three minutes 47.24 secs, while two-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya won the 1500m, with Laura Muir, who won silver in Tokyo, only managing 12th.\n\nOlympic silver medallist Dalilah Muhammad set a new meeting record of 52.77 secs in the 400m hurdles, while Kenya\u2019s Norah Jeruto won the women\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase and Uganda\u2019s 5,000m gold medallist Joshua Cheptegei set a new two-mile world lead of eight minutes 9.55 secs.\n\nIn the field events, Olympic pole vault champion Katie Nageotte, also of the US, won with a jump of 4.82m, again finishing ahead of Tokyo silver medallist Holly Bradshaw.\n\nPortugal\u2019s triple jump Olympic champion Pedro Pichardo continued his winning form at Hayward Field, while Ukraine\u2019s Iryna Gerashchenko, fourth in Tokyo, won the women\u2019s high jump.\n\nElsewhere, Elliot Giles finished fourth in the men\u2019s 800m \u2013 won by Canada\u2019s Marco Arop \u2013 while British team-mate Oliver Dustin slipped down into seventh after leading into the final straight.\n\nNext stop on the Diamond League tour is Lausanne on Thursday, before Paris next Saturday.",

          "text": "The Israeli military has launched air raids on Gaza following clashes between its soldiers and Palestinian protesters during a demonstration to commemorate the burning of Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque 52 years ago.\n\nIn a statement late on Saturday, the Israeli military said it struck four weapons manufacturing and storage sites in Gaza belonging to Hamas, the group that governs the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe raids came hours after Israeli soldiers opened fire on crowds of young Palestinians protesting at the fence separating Gaza and Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said dozens of people were wounded, including a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot in the head.\n\n\u201cForty-one civilians were wounded with various injuries,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military called the protesters \u201crioters\u201d and said some had tried to climb the border fence and hurled \u201cexplosive devices\u201d at its soldiers.\n\nThe military said it \u201cresponded with riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire\u201d and added that an Israeli soldier was \u201ccritically injured by live fire emanating from Gaza\u201d.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Youmna al-Sayed said at least 10 of the Palestinians wounded were children and two were in a critical condition.\n\nShe said Palestinian factions had urged a peaceful commemoration ahead of the demonstration, while \u201cHamas called out the Israeli occupation forces\u2019 excessive force against unarmed civilians as a regular thing Israel is used to\u201d.\n\nThe group also \u201csaid the Palestinians will continue to send messages that they will not allow the Israeli forces to continue imposing the siege on the Gaza Strip and its people\u201d, she added.\n\nLate on Saturday, Hamas and other groups in Gaza issued a joint statement in which they \u201csaluted the heroic youth\u201d who clashed with Israeli forces.\n\nThe violence was some of the worst since a deadly assault by Israel on the Gaza Strip in May.\n\nOver 11 days that month, Israel pounded Gaza with air attacks in response to rocket fire from the enclave. Hamas and other groups said they took action after Israeli forces violently stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound several times, including on the holiest night of Ramadan.\n\nAt least 260 Palestinians, including 67 children, and 13 Israelis were killed in the fighting.\n\nThe conflict ended with a ceasefire on May 21 but reconstruction in Gaza has stalled, in part because of a crippling blockade Israel has maintained on the enclave since Hamas seized power in 2007.\n\nThe new Israeli government, headed by Naftali Bennett, has blocked aid from Qatar, calling for a mechanism to ensure Hamas does not benefit from the cash. It has also blocked the import of key reconstruction materials while demanding that Hamas first return the remains of two soldiers killed in a 2014 war and two Israeli civilians believed to be alive.\n\nOn Thursday, however, Israel announced an agreement with Qatar to resume aid payments to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, the funds are to be transferred by the UN directly to Gaza families, while giving Israel oversight over the list of recipients. The payments are expected to begin in the coming weeks.",
