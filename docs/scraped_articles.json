Of course, you know that South-East was boiling because of IPOB; North-East also boiling; North Central has issues of border clashes and so on; South-West has issues of kidnapping even in Lagos.\n\n\u201dThe only peaceful region we have in Nigeria is the South-South because we are peaceful people and that is why peaceful things will follow you. We want peace in the APC because we are peace-loving people.\n\n\u201dAnd so when you have peace in the South-South being threatened and people giving ultimatum that within seven days if you don\u2019t set up the NDDC they are going to blow oil pipelines, we knew that the whole thing was a game plan by enemies outside the region.\n\n\u201dThose outside this region also want our region to boil like theirs. If we allow that to happen Nigeria would have gone to another phase because the resources used in managing Nigeria 90% comes from your region.\n\n\u201dAnd so they want to make your region ungovernable. And that is why I salute the courage of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Akpabio who sat down and said he wants to go to the creeks to talk to those who are giving these ultimatums.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that enemies of the region have misconstrued the forensic audit ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari to right the past wrongs in the NDDC and were rather insisting on the inauguration of a board for the commission.\n\nEarlier, a member of the Board of Trustees of the APC and former military administrator of Ogun and Rivers State, Group Capt. Sam Ewang (retd), appreciated members of the group drawn from the 31 local government areas of the state for the prompt response despite the short notice.\n\nHe explained that the PPI stood for governance and people-oriented policies which APC epitomises.\n\nHe also condemned the overbearing and undemocratic antics of some leaders of the APC who circumvented due process in the purported ward congresses recently conducted in the Akwa Ibom.",

Even food vendors were seen in the major streets of Owerri doing their selling.\n\nTraders started opening their shops at Eke ukwu and Relief markets, fillings stations, Supermarkets, Eatries were all opened for businesses.\n\nHowever, areas like the three Local Government Areas of, Aboh, Ezinihitte and Ahiara Mbaise, there were panics on hearing that some suspected members of the Eastern Security Network, ESN, were said to have forced about three commercial buses heading to Umuahia to go back.\n\nThe affected motorists while returning stopped at Afor Ogbe and spread the news that \u201cESN boys are on the road. They asked us to go back or they will destroy us. We have to go back for our safety.\n\n\u201cThey were wearing black and black and some of them with guns and knife. They are looking angrily and ready to do anything.\u201d\n\nThe situation was heightened when the story was told of a particular commercial bus that was set ablaze by the ESN boys many residents out of fear were forced back to their homes to stay safe.\n\nAlso, the story was not different from Orlu area, where shops, banks were shutdown even at about 10:30am. It was only around 11:30 am that human and vehicular movements were seen in the Orlu town.\n\nThe reason, Vanguard gathered was because of the insecurity situation that has troubled the Orlu main town for the past two weeks. The insecurity caused by opposing camps for and against the agitations for Biafra Republic.\n\nAlso, the residents of Orlu, were afraid that the beheadings and killings in Orlu, may continue should anybody be seen outside, on the day of the sit at home.",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nThe Federal Government has announced a new date of Aug. 16 to begin administering the second batch of COVID-19 Moderna vaccines doses donated by the U.S.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed made the announcement on Monday when he featured on \u201cGood Morning Nigeria\u2019\u2019 a live programme of the Nigerian Television Authority.\n\nSpeaking on the programme monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, the minister said the postponement of the vaccination exercise from Aug. 10 to Aug. 16 was \u201cpurely administrative\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe have received 4,80,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine and we will commence administering the doses on Monday Aug. 16.\n\n\u201cThe exercise was supposed to commence tomorrow Aug. 10, but we suspended it till Monday, and the reason is purely administrative.\n\n\u201cYou see, when vaccines arrive the country, they are taken to National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC)\n\n\u201cThe agency which will analyse them and thereafter give us a green light for the use,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister debunked reports in certain publications that the exercise was postponed indefinitely over concerned raised by some experts on the propriety of using Moderna vaccines.\n\nHe said, like the first batch of the Astrazeneca Vaccine which had been fully administered without hitch, the doses of Moderna vaccine donated to the country by the US were \u201csafe and meant to save lives\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI want to thank Nigerians for the way they responded to the first batch of Astrazeneca Vaccine.\n\n\u201cI can say authoritatively that we succeeded administering the four million doses of the vaccine and we do not have a single expired vaccine.\n\n\u201cThey were all administered to the targeted population.\n\n\u201cI want to encourage Nigerians to come out also to take the Moderna vaccine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister also disclosed that the second phase of the vaccination exercise would target people from 18 years and above.\n\nHe explained that the 18 years and above were targeted because the younger ones, even in the US, were now becoming more vulnerable to COVID-19infection and attack\n\nMohammed underscored the need for people to come out to take the vaccine stressing that \u201cNigeria has entered the third wave of COVID-19\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe explained that the Delta variant of COVID-19 pandemic which is more virulent and deadly had been recorded in some states since July.\n\n\u201cIf you have our two doses, it is clear that even if you are infected with COVID-19, it will be very mild.\n\n\u201cYou will not be hospitalised, talk less of death as opposed to the fellow that has not taken the vaccine.\n\n\u201cSo, we must encourage people to go out and take the vaccine,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMohammed said following the pandemic, a major challenge faced was \u201cinfodemic\u2019\u2019 caused by fake news around the vaccine.\n\n\u201cFor instance, they first came up with the fake news that it has magnetic effect if you take the vaccine.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they said it was meant to depopulate certain part of the country.\n\n\u201c All this is not true because every vaccine you use today has been proven to be safe and to safe life.\n\n\u201c If the vaccines are not safe, they will not be administered,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMohammed reiterated the call on religious and community leaders, media and other influential people to join the Presidential Committee on COVID-19 in fighting fake news and disinformation around the vaccines.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on Aug.2, Nigeria received four million doses of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines donated by the United States government.\n\nHealth Minister Osagie Ehanire said the vaccines, which arrived are undergoing validation by the country\u2019s drug regulator.\n\nHe said the doses will be distributed to the local states once they are certified fit for use.\n\nThe U.S. government last week shipped nearly 10 million doses to two of the most populous African countries \u2013 Nigeria and South Africa.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "\u2022With 559 days to election, search for a new president begins\n\nObinna Chima\n\nWith exactly 559 days to the 2023 presidential election, the search for a new leader for Africa\u2019s most populous country and largest economy \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 has begun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had early in the year announced Saturday, February 18, as the date for the 2023 general election.\n\nFormer Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB), had curiously opened up a new angle to the 2023 debate, when in an interview on the Arise News Channel, last week, hinted at the qualities a majority of Nigerians should consider in their choice ofthe next occupant of Aso Rock, the Presidential Villa.\n\nIBB as Babangida is fondly called, had suggested that individuals in their 60s should be the focus of Nigerians as potential presidential or vice presidential candidates in 2023.\n\nFurther, IBB said such persons should have deep knowledge of the economy, must have contacts across the nation and must have been traversing the geo-political zones, marketing their acceptability and capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay. I have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very vast in the economy and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties,\u201d the Minna-born former military leader said.\n\nWith this submission, the former military president, was believed to have ruled out a former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, from the 2023 presidential run, because they would be in their 70s by the next election.\n\nOwing to the mood of the nation, the expectation is largely that the person should be from the southern part of the country. But that is not a given, especially, when the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) argues otherwise in its search for a suitable presidential material.\n\nHowever, given this situation, political pundits have identified a number of Nigerians, who would be under 70 years by 2023 and have the capability to add value to the society, judging from their contributions in either the public or private sectors.\n\nAny of the identified individuals, experts believe, has the skills and competence to steer the country towards realising its much-talked about potential as well as address the socio-economic challenges that have over the years plagued the country.\n\nHere are some eminent Nigerians who may very well fit the bill of IBB\u2019s description of the person to be next President or Vice President in first name alphabetical order.\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu was born on August 4, 1960 in Kano State. He is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder and Chairman of the BUA Group, a Nigerian conglomerate concentrating on manufacturing, infrastructure and agriculture. He attended Capital University in Columbus, Ohio and returned to Nigeria at the age of 24 to oversee his father\u2019s business.\n\nDue to his business interest, Rabiu has establishments across the country. In June this year, the French President, Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the France-Nigeria Business Council \u2013 a private sector initiative to enhance business relations between the two countries and announced Rabiu as the inaugural president of the council.\n\nBut Rabiu is one of the politically green individuals on the list. With near zero political credentials, it does appear tough for Rabiu to sit in this category, but not impossible.\n\nAbdullahi Sule\n\nBorn in December 1959, Abdullahi Sule, is a Nigerian entrepreneur, businessman and politician, who is the current Governor of Nasarawa State. He was elected governor in 2019.\n\nHe attended Roman Catholic Mission (RMC) Primary School, Gudi Station in 1968; Zang Secondary School in 1974, and later Government Technical College, Bukuru in 1977. He left Nigeria on a scholarship to study at Indiana University, Terre Haute, Indiana, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Technology and a master\u2019s degree in Industrial Technology.\n\nAs a governor and businessman in his early sixties, he appears to fit the bill, especially, coming from a liberal northern region \u2013 North Central \u2013 and having managed Dangote Sugar at some point. But with the clamour for a southern president, it may be a tough call for him. Besides, will gamble his near certain re-election for the uncertain presidency?\n\nAbubakar Bagudu\n\nSenator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu is the eighth Governor of Kebbi State, who assumed office on May 29, 2015. The Governor has a lifelong commitment to public service and the proven leadership skills to make government work for the people of his state. Prior to his election in May 2015, he represented Kebbi Central at the Senate.\n\nUnder his leadership, the state entered into a partnership with the Lagos State government on the establishment of a commodity value chain that will give a quantum leap to food processing, production and distribution. This partnership, which is the first of its kind in the history of the Nigerian agricultural sector, is aimed at bringing about national food sufficiency and food security.\n\nHe had his tertiary education at the Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto State, where he obtained his B.Sc in Economics. He proceeded to the University of Jos, Plateau State, where he had his Master of Science in Economics and thereafter, went to Columbia University,where he obtained his M.A in International Affairs.\n\nHowever, coming from a core northern state \u2013 North West \u2013 it is almost a difficult gamble at a time southern presidency is the issue.\n\nAigboje Aig-Imoukhuede\n\nAigboje Aig-Imoukhuede was born in September 1966. He is a Nigerian banker, investor and philanthropist. He is the former Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc as well as the founder and Chairman of Coronation Capital Limited, its affiliates, Coronation Asset Management Limited and Trium Limited.\n\nHe founded Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG) in 2014, and he is the Co-Chairman of the United Kingdom-Nigeria Capital Market Task Force and a board member of TCX Investment Management Company Netherlands. He hails from Edo State and studied law at the University of Benin, where he graduated with LLB degree in 1986. He holds an MBA awarded jointly by the London School of Economics, New York University, and HEC Paris.\n\nAlthough boasts sound economic background, his politics is however nil. It may be another hard nut to crack, albeit not impossible.\n\nAkinwunmi Adesina\n\nAkinwunmi Adesina was born on February 6, 1960. An economist, who is currently serving his second term as the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), had previously served as Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nUntil his appointment as Minister in 2010, he was Vice President of Policy and Partnerships for the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). He is the first Nigeria to be elected AfDB President and hails from Ogun State in South-west Nigeria.\n\nClearly, Adesina has distinguished himself in the business world with sound economic literature, nothing however shows he is able to manage the political side of governance. He also stands a good chance, coming from the Southwest.\n\nAliko Dangote\n\nAliko Dangote was born on April 10, 1957. He is the President of the Dangote Group,which has wide interest in the manufacturing sector. He is Africa\u2019s richest man with an estimated net worth of $11.1 billion as of May 2021. Dangote hails from Kano State and obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in business studies and administration from Al-Azhar University, Cairo.\n\nMany Nigerians believe that if given the opportunity, he could reflect the successes recorded in his companies, which he established as a small trading firm in 1977, and presently have grown into multi-trillion-naira conglomerate with many of its operations in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and Togo, among others.\n\nThe Dangote Group also dominates the sugar market in Nigeria and is a major supplier to the country\u2019s soft drink companies, breweries, and confectioners. The Dangote Group is on the verge of completing its refinery. But, apart from being from the north, Dangote is believed not to have the temperament for politics, although he has friends across all interests. He is currently building one of the largest refinery and petrol chemical plant in the world in Lagos.\n\nAmina Mohammed\n\nMs. Amina Mohammed was born in 1961 in Kaduna State. She is presently the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group. Prior to her appointment, she served as Minister of Environment in Nigeria, where she steered the country\u2019s efforts on climate action and efforts to protect the natural environment.\n\nMohammed first joined the United Nations in 2012 as Special Adviser to former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with the responsibility for post-2015 development planning. She led the process that resulted in global agreement around the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the creation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nShe began her career working on the design of schools and clinics in Nigeria. She served as an advocate focused on increasing access to education and other social services, before moving into the public sector, where she rose to the position of adviser to four successive Presidents on poverty, public sector reform, and sustainable development.\n\nThere\u2019s no gainsaying that this is coming at a time the call to give women a chance has attracted a global attention. Whilst working at the UN might give her some political leverage, being from the north is a major mark down.\n\nAminu Tambuwal\n\nAminu Tambuwal was born in January 1966. The current Governor of Sokoto State, he served as the 10th Speaker of the House of Representatives. He attended Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, where he studied Law, graduating with an LLB (Hons) degree in 1991.\n\nHe completed his one-year compulsory legal studies at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos, obtained his BL and was called to the Bar in 1992.\n\nTambuwal is a leader, who understands how to manage the country\u2019s diversity and has friends across the spectrum of the country\u2019s diversity, leveraging more on his days as Speaker. He is, no doubt, well positioned to manage the nation\u2019s many tendencies if given the opportunity.\n\nAtedo Peterside\n\nAtedo Peterside, born in July 1955, is an entrepreneur, investment banker, and economist. He is the founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, Anap Business Jets Limited (Anap Jets), and Anap Foundation. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics from the City University, London.\n\nHe went on to obtain an M.Sc. in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1977. Peterside founded the Investment Banking & Trust Company Limited (IBTC) in February 1989 at 33 and served as the bank\u2019s CEO until 2007.\n\nIn 2007, IBTC Chartered Bank Plc merged with Stanbic Bank Nigeria Limited to form Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, and he was elected Chairman of Stanbic IBTC Bank in October 2007, and he resigned in 2017.\n\nAlthough he has always held strong political views, it doesn\u2019t make him politically inclined, much as he is from the southern part of the country, which seeks to produce the next president.\n\nBabatunde Fashola\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola was born in June 1963 and presently the Minister of Works and Housing. He served two terms as Governor of Lagos State from May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015. In 2015, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the Minister of Power, Works and Housing.\n\nHe studied law at the University of Benin, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, LL.B.(Hon), degree in 1987.\n\nFashola, a Notary Public of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, was the second law graduate from the University of Benin and the first member of the Nigerian Law School graduating class of 1988 to be conferred with the professional rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nWith his stellar performance as governor of Lagos State, which put the state on the world map, Fashola is easily one of the few generally adjudged as fit to run Nigeria, almost effortlessly.\n\nApart from boasting capacity and competence, he is also a southerner from the Southwest to be precise. He is loved and respected by his friends for his discipline and political maturity. He is an exceptionally brilliant mind and aptly fits the bill.\n\nBenedict Oramah\n\nDr. Benedict Okey Oramah has been the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank) since September 2015. Under his leadership, the pan-African institution has been playing a leading role in supporting businesses and countries on the continent.\n\nOramah was the Executive Vice President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking from October 2008. In that position, he supervised the business development departments and units of the Bank, namely, Trade Finance and Branches; Project and Export Development Finance; Syndications and Specialised Finance; and Corporate Finance and Advisory Services.\n\nHe joined Afreximbank as Chief Analyst in 1994 and was promoted to the position of Senior Director, Planning and Business Development in 2007. Prior to joining Afreximbank, he was an Assistant Research Manager at the Nigerian Export Import Bank from 1992.\n\nHe holds M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in agricultural economics, obtained in 1987 and 1991 respectively, from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. He bagged, also, a B.Sc. degree in agricultural economics, from the University of Ibadan in 1983. There\u2019s no doubting the fact that he has sufficient private sector experience, but same cannot be said for politics.\n\nBukola Saraki\n\nDr. Bukola Saraki, a former President of the Senate, was Governor of Kwara State from 2003 to 2011; and was elected to the Senate in 2011. Saraki was born in December 1962, in London. He attended Cheltenham College, a public boarding school in the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1981.\n\nHe then proceeded to London Hospital Medical College of the University of London from 1982 to 1987, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery.\n\nSaraki worked as a medical officer at Rush Green Hospital, Essex and had been a Director of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Bank (Nigeria) Limited. In 2000, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Saraki as his Special Assistant on Budget.\n\nIn addition, Saraki had since the passing of his father, Dr. Olusola Saraki, taken over the political machine of the man mimicked the strongman of Kwara politics and has continued to manage it.\n\nIt is evident that Saraki has grown not only to understand the nuances of both the private and public sector, but also has a good hand of the game of politics. Indeed, many people believed IBB had Saraki in mind, when he gave his description of those eligible to lead Nigeria in 2023.\n\nNothing, however, affirms Saraki\u2019s capacity to effectively lead Nigeria than his four years as Senate President. Although from the North Central region, Saraki is one presidential hopeful believed to stand astride between the South and the north and suitable for the job, if and when a northern joker is to be thrown up in 2023.\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nChukwuma Soludo was born in July 1960. An economics professor and former Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, he is presently the factional gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance. He is also a member of the British Department for International Development Advisory Group.\n\nSoludo has been a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund, the University of Cambridge, the Brookings Institution, the University of Warwick, and the University of Oxford as well as a visiting professor at Swarthmore College (USA). He has also worked as a consultant for a number of international organisations, including The World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nA southerner from the East and combining both the private and public sector experience, Soludo is currently obsessed with his governorship ambition in Anambra State and may not have considered the presidency as an option. However, he also fits the bill.\n\nGodwin Emefiele\n\nThe current Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele was born in August, 1961. He holds a B.Sc. in Finance (1984) and an MBA in Finance (1986), both from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He is also an alumnus of Executive Education at Stanford University, Harvard University (2004) and Wharton School of Business (2005).\n\nHaving run Nigeria\u2019s leading bank, Zenith Bank Plc., for eight years and the Central Bank for six years, he knows exactly what is wrong with the economy. His Anchor borrowers programme has greatly helped poor farmers all over the country, particularly in the North where is well liked.\n\nHe is also well regarded in the Southwest where he was born and known as Omoluabi. Emefiele speaks Yoruba fluently. And he is Igbo speaking from the South-South. Fitting perfectly to the clamour for an Igbo speaking president. Emefiele would be a good fit for president.\n\nGodwin Obaseki\n\nGodwin Obaseki was born in July 1957 and is currently the Governor of Edo State. Before becoming governor, he had served as the chairman of the Edo State Economic and Strategy Team inaugurated by former Governor Adams Oshiomole in March 2009.\n\nHe holds post graduate degrees in both Finance and International Business and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Stock Brokers. Obaseki served as an executive board member of several private companies including Afrinvest.\n\nAs governor and businessman, he clearly has both the private and public sector experience. Perhaps, he needs to do more in terms of disposition and capacity to manage tendence. But, he is pretty much close to the rudimentary requisite.\n\nHerbert Wigwe\n\nHerbert Wigwe was born in August 1966. He is the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing financial institutions. Wigwe has a degree in accountancy from the University of Nigeria, an MA in Banking and Finance from the University College of North Wales (now Bangor), an MSc in Financial Economics from the University of London, and is an Alumnus of the Harvard Business School Executive Management Programme.\n\nHowever, apart from his relationship with politicians, his political credential is nothing close to the requirement of the office of the president except he learns on the job. His current job also gives him contacts across the divides and interests.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nIbikunle Amosun, a former governor of Ogun State and two-term senator, was born in January 1958. Amosun attended Ogun State Polytechnic, graduating with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in 1983.\n\nHe became an Associate member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1990 and went on to become a fellow of the Institute in 1996. He also became an Associate member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (1998).\n\nToday, in Ogun State, Amosun is the single most important issue in the body polity. With a closeness to President Muhammadu Buhari that is beyond human comprehension and a relationship with others across the bridges of the nation, Amosun is largely considered the president\u2019s number one preference from the Southwest if he were given the privilege.\n\nAside being in a vantage position with the part of the country he hails from, Amosun also boasts both the private and the public sectors experience, leaving him with considerable advantage for the job.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nDr. Kayode Fayemi, born in February 1965, is currently serving as the Governor of Ekiti State. He previously served as governor between 2010 and 2014 and was also the Minister of Solid Minerals Development in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet from 11 November 2015 to 30 May 2018, when he resigned to contest for a second time as governor.\n\nHe obtained degrees in History, Politics and International Relations from the University of Lagos and University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). From 1989 to 1992, he earned a Doctorate in War Studies from King\u2019s College London, specialising in civil-military relations.\n\nPut on a scale, Fayemi is believed to be about the most advantageous from the Southwest, being a Christian with high political leverage. His chairmanship of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) confers an unequalled advantage on him, making him have the ears of his colleagues.\n\nAnd with the ongoing extrapolation of a majority of the northern governors, who are largely Muslims, paring with a Christian southern governor is the only gamble they want to take, more so after they had allegedly resolved to ensure that both the offices of the president and the vice president were occupied by governors \u2013 former or current. Fayemi fits the bill.\n\nKingsley Moghalu\n\nProfessor Kingsley Moghalu is already a 2023 presidential aspirant. A lawyer, author and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, he taught at Tufts University as Professor of Practice in International Business and Public Policy at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy from 2015 to 2017.\n\nHe was the presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) in the February 2019, general election. He is the founder of Sogato Strategies LLC, a global investment advisory firm, and the president of the Institute for Governance and Economic Transformation (IGET), a public policy think tank. He is a potential candidate for the office of the president \u2013 skilled largely in private sector experience. He once took his chances in an election, even though he was barely noticed from the votes tabulation.\n\nLeo Stan Ekeh\n\nLeonard Stanley Ekeh was born in February 1956. He has strong knowledge of the economy, especially, how to use technology in transforming an economy. He is the founder and chairman of Zinox Group and also the chairman of Konga.com, a leading e-Commerce company.\n\nDuring his early years, he wanted to own the biggest transport company in Nigeria. He later went to India for his university education, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Punjab University.\n\nEkeh believes that studying in India was a great turning point in his career, because he found the economy of India to be realistic. He also earned an MSc in Risk Management from the University of Nottingham.\n\nHe too has a strong network of friends across the country and affiliations with some of the global tech companies. But like some of his contemporaries in the business world, his connection to the political class is limited and indeed, defined.\n\nWith many of the factors in his favour, his poor understanding of politics is a minus that counts. But whether or not Nigeria wants him that way is a different kettle of fish for as long as votes count.\n\nNasir El-Rufai\n\nThe Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, was born in February 1960. He was aMinister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; and the director of the Bureau of Public Enterprises. El-Rufai attended Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in quantity surveying with first class honours.\n\nIn 1984, he received a Master of Business Administration from the Ahmadu Bello University. He has since attended several professional and post-graduate programmes, including the Georgetown School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C and programmes on privatisation and leadership.\n\nEl-Rufai, no doubt has always had his eyes on the presidency, even though he too believes a younger person is better off on the nation\u2019s number one seat. Interestingly, he has been an advocate for power to return to the south almost since the beginning of this dispensation. Whether or not he would accept to deputise anyone is another ball game altogether.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala\n\nDr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was born in June 1954. She is an economist and the serving Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. She is the first woman and first African to lead global trade body. A two-term former Minister in Nigeria, she sits on boards of Danone, Standard Chartered Bank, Twitter, Mandela Institute for Development Studies, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, One Campaign, GAVI: Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, Rockefeller Foundation, among several global institutions.\n\nShe is another woman, aside Amina, that many people feel deserve a chance to lead the country from the doldrums. Okon-Iweala has no doubt distinguished herself in service to fatherland and indeed, the world.\n\nHowever, she may suffer a different fate as Amina. While she is from the south and might benefit from the agitation for zoning, the question of whether or not Nigeria is ready for a female president never goes away.\n\nPeter Obi\n\nPeter Obi was born in July 1961. He is a politician and businessman, who was the vice presidential candidate during the 2019 general election. A former governor of Anambra State, Obi obtained his first degree at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, graduating with a B.A (Hons) in philosophy in 1984.\n\nHe attended Lagos business school, where he did his Chief executive programme; Harvard business school, Boston, USA, where he did two programmes; London School of Economics, Columbia southwest school, New York, USA, Institute for management development, Switzerland, where he also got two certificates in Senior Executive Programme and Chief Executive Officers programme. He also attended Kellogg graduate school of Management, USA, Oxford University: Said business school and Cambridge University\u2019s George business school.\n\nA Christian from the Southeast zone of the country, Obi has everything going for him, including the understanding of the issues as well as the capacity to sell them. Whether or not the Southeast could get it, is a question the whole of the South would have to answer as the battle for zoning to the region rages. But, yes, he fits the bill.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nRotimi Amaechi, born in May 1965, is the current Minister of Transportation. He served as Governor of Rivers State from 2007 to 2015 and Speaker of the State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2007 \u2013 back to back.\n\nAmaechi received a Bachelor of Arts degree (Honours) in English Studies and Literature from the University of Port Harcourt in 1987. He is currently studying law at a university in Nigeria.\n\nOf all the ministers in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet, Amaechi is one of the few, who have distinguished themselves in terms of performance, and curiously, has become the face of the administration as its poster child.\n\nBut, again, apart from fitting the bill of the president Nigeria needs, Amaechi is one of the few actors, who have not hidden their desire to be president. Not only is he working to achieve this goal, he is also building bridges to that effect.\n\nWith stellar record of performance as minister and a network of friends across the country, a situation made easy by his position as Buhari\u2019s campaign DG for the two times, Amaechi is also believed to have the capacity to muster the needed war chest to prosecute a presidential electoral battle.\n\nBesides, he is also a Christian of the Catholic denomination, whom many of the Northern Muslim governors might want to deputise for a balanced presidential ticket.\n\nSanusi Lamido Sanusi\n\nSanusi was born in July 1961. He is a former Emir of Kano. He is a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria as well as a former Chief Executive Officer of First Bank. Sanusi is a prominent traditional and religious figure as the leader of the Tijaniyyah Sufi order in Nigeria, the second largest Sufi order after the Qadiriyya Sufi order. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from the Ahmadu Bello University in 1981 and a Master degree in Economics. Sanusi has both private and public sector experience and he has a rich network of friends across the country. He understands the workings of the economy.\n\nSegun Agbaje\n\nSegun Agbaje, born in 1964, is the Chief Executive Officer of Guaranty Trust Holding Company. He is also a Director of PepsiCo and member of the Mastercard Advisory Board, Middle East and Africa. Agbaje attended the University of San Francisco, California, where he earned Bachelor of Accounting and Master of Business Administration degrees.\n\nHe started his career working for Ernst & Young in San Francisco and left in 1991 to join GTBank. He rose through the ranks to become an Executive Director in January 2000, and Deputy Managing Director in August 2002.\n\nAgbaja has always played in the private sector with no profile on the political turf and thus, combining both might be quite difficult, since his only option, which is to learn on the job, might be too costly for the patience of the Nigerian people. A Christian, Agbaje is however within the age range of those being sourced, including coming from a privileged zone \u2013 Southwest.\n\nSeyi Makinde\n\nSeyi Makinde, Governor of Oyo State, was born in December, 1967. A businessman, politician and philanthropist, he is an engineer and until his election, he was the GMD of Makon Group Limited, an indigenous oil and gas company.\n\nHe established his first oil and gas private business called Makon Engineering and Technical Services, (METS) at the age of 29, in 1997, after earning years of work experience with international oil and gas companies. He obtained his first degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. In 2000, he had training in automation.\n\nIn 2002, he studied Fundamentals of Crude Sampling at Jiskoot Auto Control Training Centre, Kent, England. Also, in 2005, he studied Understanding and Solving Complex Business Problems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA.\n\nArmed with both the private and public sector experience, Makinde, ticks practically all the boxes of qualification for the job, to which a competent hand is being sought. But like some of his colleagues on the list, will he be willing to leave his near-certain re-election for the uncertain presidency.\n\nImportantly, being in the opposition PDP might serve as a disadvantage for him in case his party throws the ticket open and not directly zones it to the South and Southwest to be precise.\n\nTimipre Sylva\n\nTimipre Sylva was born in July 1964 and is presently the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. He had a stint as governor of oil-rich Bayelsa State. Sylva graduated from the University of Port Harcourt with distinction in English (Linguistics) in 1986.\n\nAt the time, he was the best graduating student from his department and departmental valedictorian. He was subsequently awarded a Doctor in International Relations (Honoris causa) by the UBIS University in 2011.\n\nSylva was awarded his second Doctorate (Honoris Causa) in Public Administration on the 2nd of December 2020 by AiPA (African Institute of Public Administration, Leading Edge Foundation and LBBS.\n\nOver the years, he has developed a network of friends across the country and as a former governor currently holding a political office, there\u2019s no debating the fact that he understands both the business and politics of governance.\n\nInterestingly, those said to be looking in the way of Sylva were believed to be considering him as an option to neutralise the influence and weight of Amaechi in the Niger Delta. Although Sylva and Amaechi were believed to have closed ranks sometime back, it is not certain they would not resume another round of hostility as 2023 inches close.\n\nThat said, Sylva comes close in the category of potential presidential material.\n\nTony Elumelu\n\nTony Elumelu was born in March, 1963. He is an economist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is also the chairman of Heirs Holdings, the United Bank for Africa, Transcorp and founder of The Tony Elumelu Foundation. Elumelu was named among Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People of 2020.\n\nHe hails from Delta State and has two degrees in economics from Nigerian universities: a bachelor\u2019s degree from Ambrose Alli University and Master of Science degree from the University of Lagos.\n\nA shrewd private sector actor, Elumelu\u2019s political inclination appears not sufficient except he learns on the job too. Although he also carries with him some street smartness, which could provide some leverage, how much of contacts he has is definitely not in doubt. With age, knowledge, experience, money and influence, he may not be a bad choice after all.\n\nUdoma Udo Udoma\n\nUdoma Udo Udoma is a former Minister of Budget and National Planning. He is the founding partner of Udo Udoma & Belo Osagie \u2013 one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest and largest commercial law firms.\n\nHe attended St. Catherine\u2019s College, Oxford, England, where he obtained a B.A. (Law) degree in 1976 and a B.C.L. degree in jurisprudence in 1977. He was called to the Nigerian Bar Association in 1978, after obtaining a B.L. degree at the Nigerian Law School.\n\nEvidently in his sixties and with experience in both the private and the public sectors, Udoma has a lot to offer, especially, with his disciplined disposition. A Christian too, he might have to battle internal party antics to get any close. But, without a doubt, he has distinguished himself as worthy.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nProfessor Yemi Osinbajo was born in March 1957 and is currently the vice president. A professor of law, he had his undergraduate degree at the University of Lagos, where he obtained a Second Class Honours (Upper Division) Degree in Law.\n\nIn 1979, he completed the mandatory one-year professional training at the Nigerian Law School, whereon he was admitted to practice as a Barrister and Solicitor of Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court. In 1980, he attended the London School of Economics, where he obtained a Master of Laws degree.\n\nGiven a different field of play, Osinbajo should have been the most eligible to take over from Buhari in 2023. First, he is a Christian of the Pentecostal denomination. Two, he is from the Southwest. Three, he is in his sixties. Four, he can combine both politics and the economy for a smooth run governance.\n\nAlthough he is believed to have zero political base, which is understandable, it is also arguable that he might have learnt on the job, whilst his understanding of the nation\u2019s economy is by every inch not in doubt.\n\nAbove all, having walked with Buhari for eight years, no one can sell the programmes of the administration better or able to sustain the programmes of the regime, whose CHANGE mantra is predicated on the tripod of economy, corruption and security \u2013 the three major monsters still confronting the nation till date, than Osinbajo.\n\nUnfortunately, Osinbajo is believed to have had it pretty much rough with some of those believed to be controlling other levers of power \u2013 a friction that has created an irredeemable level of mistrust. That, of course, appears his only but major undoing as he continues to stealthily eye the presidency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says all party structures hitherto dissolved must be re-instated from NEC to ward executives\n\n\u2022Explains PDP, Jegede didn\u2019t challenge votes cast but nomination of APC candidate\n\nFormer National Legal Adviser of the APC, Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), has again advanced legal reasons why the All Progressives Congress (APC) congresses remained a nullity in the eyes of the law and should be cancelled forthwith.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that he was advancing his legal views on the problems associated with the congresses of the party.\n\nIn his first view, he recommended the reinstatement of the dissolved National Working Committee (NWC) without the former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, because his suspension followed due process.\n\nOrdinarily, he said the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BOT) should have held sway, however,lamented that, as at press time, the ruling party had no BOT.\n\nYet, in his second legal opinion, he reiterated his conviction that the congresses of APC remained a nullity in the eyes of the law.\n\nHe also contended that the reason the APC was deliberately looking away from the facts, was because the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Eyitayo Jegeda, did not challenge the votes cast in that election but rather zeroed in on the nomination of the APC candidate and the nomination process, adding that in response to that the apex court submission that, \u201cGovernor Buni ought to have been joined, does this not say it all?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the PDP governors\u2019 meeting today, where a position is expected to be taken before their meeting with the special committee of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT), one of the top members of the National Working Committee (NWC) has said the current leadership of the party was not desperate to remain in office beyond December 9 this year.\n\nAddressing the state of the party, Ogala said, \u201cI hold the view that it is incorrect (factually and contextually) to state that the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Tribunal regarding the impact of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended) and Article 17(iv) of the APC Constitution. If this was the case, the Court would not require that Governor Mai Mala Buni ought to have been joined as the Court would have already determined the question in his absence.\n\n\u201cThe purport of the advice of the learned Attorney General of the Federation (with respect) is akin to asking a Pastor or an Imam who is watching on his CCTV camera in his house as 3 (Three) strange men armed with guns and cutlasses scale over his fence, heading for his back door, not to alert the Police but to instead allow them enter his sitting room so he can confirm if they came to rob him or they came to seek deliverance at 2 am in the night.\n\n\u201cThat opinion most respectfully stands logic on its head, and it is therefore misleading in my opinion. Also, it is not correct to insist that the opinion of the minority in this case is meaningless taking into account the fact that the majority rested its decision on a technical point.\n\n\u201cThe technical point, which is non-joinder is one that can be cured in any subsequent suit and that is why the failure of the majority decision to directly disagree with the substance of the minority decision presents an existential threat to the All Progressives Congress. As I noted in my earlier opinion, the Court gave a hint by the silence of the majority and a wink by the decision of the minority.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the purport of the advice of the learned Attorney General of the Federation (with respect) is akin to asking a Pastor or an Imam who is watching on his CCTV camera in his house as 3 (Three) strange men armed with guns and cutlasses scale over his fence, heading for his back door, not to alert the Police but to instead allow them enter his sitting room so he can confirm if they came to rob him or they came to seek deliverance at 2 am in the night. I would have thought that the smart money would be to call the police so that they can seek deliverance in the presence of the Police.\n\n\u201cIt is my view that it is wrong and unfair on APC and all those who seek office through its platform to be asked to face the risk faced by our Governor, Arakurin Akeredolu. This can be avoided by doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIn another breath, those who compare APC to a club, or an association of elected officers miss the point completely. Besides being a constitutional entity provided for in Sections 221, 222 and 223 of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended), APC has presence of party leadership through its Polling Unit Committee in over 170,000 Polling Units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the NWC and his team are responsible for the day-to-day running of this huge statutory entity and that is the role being played by Governor Buni and his team today. How can this not be an executive position as contemplated by Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution?\u201d\n\nHe said the apex Court has not left anyone in doubt except those who choose to ignore them, adding, \u201cIn the light of the foregoing, how do we proceed as a political party? I hold the view that the untenable position of Governor Mai Mala Buni as de facto APC National Chairman is the smallest of APC\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is the fact that the entire Caretaker Committee structure is unconstitutional as it runs counter to the spirit of Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution, which mandates political parties to have only democratically elected leadership.\n\n\u201cIt states inter alia in Section. 223. (1) that: (a) The constitution and rules of a political party shall provide for the periodical election on a democratic basis of the principal officers and members of the executive committee or other governing body of the political party and (b) ensure that the members of the executive committee or other governing body of the political party reflect the federal character of Nigeria.\n\n\u201c(2) For the purposes of this section \u2013 (a) the election of the officers or members of the executive committee of a political party shall be deemed to be periodical only if it is made at regular intervals not exceeding four years.\u201d\n\nOgala explained that the provision was very similar to that contained in Section 7 of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended), which states that, \u201cThe system of local government by democratically elected local government councils is under this Constitution guaranteed; and accordingly, the Government of every State shall, subject to Section 8 of this Constitution, ensure their existence under a law, which provides for the establishment, structure, composition, finance and functions of such councils.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Ogala said, \u201cThis mandatory provision for democratically elected leadership was held by the Supreme Court not to admit of replacement by Caretaker Committees. This was the decision in Governor Ekiti State & Ors V Prince Sanmi Olubunmi & Ors (2016) 3 Nwlr (Part 1551).\n\n\u201cTo clear any further doubt on this point, the apex Court stated this position in respect of the case brought by ALGON against Oyo State Government. It is instructive that this case arose after the Oyo State Government disregarded the advice of the Attorney General of the Federation stating that Caretaker Committees could not replace democratically elected officers as contemplated by Section 7 of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe former national legal advisee of APC stressed further that the Supreme Court agreed with the Attorney General of the Federation then and nothing has changed in respect of that position of the law in relation to APC leadership, which the same Constitution mandated to be a product of democratic elections.\n\n\u201cTherefore, without a doubt, APC must use this opportunity to correct all mistakes by going back to that dissolution of its NWC and all democratically built structures and re-instate the democratically elected NWC members, and other structures of the party.\n\n\u201cI implore us to adopt the admonition of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN to Oyo State Governor on the dissolution of democratically elected structures of the Local Governments in the state in contravention of Section 7 of the Constitution and which said admonition was given an imprimatur by the Supreme Court in dealing with our own current challenge.\n\n\u201cSections 7 and 223 of the Constitution are almost on all fours that only democratically elected leadership shall be vested with responsibilities for the management of affairs of Local Governments and Political Parties.\u201d\n\nOgala claimed that the Supreme Court spoke on Section 7 and validated the warnings of the Attorney General to the Oyo State Government, adding, \u201cThe same warning by one of our own is also available to us in APC. Let us take heed and do the needful and respect the country\u2019s Constitution.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the learned silk maintained that, all other structures of the party hitherto dissolved must be re-instated from NEC to Ward Executives.\n\nThis, he said, \u201cis absolutely necessary, because the question of whether APC can still be referred to as a political party in its current state in view of its lack of vital organs as required by law is of a very poignant concern.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, many may feel they maintain an advantage today, because of their access and control of levers of the APC. Yet, they must be reminded that 100% of zero is still zero. Also, admittedly, the CECPC has done some work since coming on board. However, all that now stand voidable. It is my view that we save all that and more by taking the bold step now.\n\n\u201cFinally, we must recall that our electoral laws are rapidly progressive. Until recently, political parties were held to be the ones who owned votes cast at an election so it did not matter if there was a candidate or not.\u201d\n\nCiting legal authorities to substantiate his position, he urged those advocating different legal opinions to see AMAECHI v. INEC & ORS (2008) LPELR-446(SC) and argued that all that changed in Zamfara State, where in APC V MARAFA (2020) 6 NWLR (1742), the apex Court held that APC votes were wasted for not having duly nominated candidates.\n\nAlso, he said the Court never used to intervene in party congresses but in APC v. UMAR & ORS (2019) LPELR-47296(SC), the Court intervened and by so doing, APC lost out even before the election in Rivers State was conducted.\n\n\u201cThe Courts did not also use to intervene in leadership crisis of political parties since the days of Onuoha V. Okafor (1983) 2 SCNLR 24 but that changed in PDP V SENATOR ALI MODU SHERRIF & ORS. (2017) LPELR-42736(SC) and was recently reaffirmed in ADAMS ALIYU OSHIOMHOLE V COMRADE MUSTAPHA SALIHU & ORS (2021) 8 NWLR (PART1778).\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the trajectory of the Courts in respect of political matters was fairly apparent and predictable, when examined without bias and vested interest.\n\nOgala concluded by urging the APC to make haste when the sun was still shining, saying, \u201cI urge our leaders to take heed while the party still can\u201d.\n\nIn the PDP, an NWC member, who didn\u2019t want to be quoted, said the constitution of the PDP did not recognise any caretaker committee, explaining that the APC was enjoying a caretaker committeeship, because of the respect INEC gave to the ruling party and President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe NWC member, therefore, called for a law by the National Assembly to make INEC and all the political parties in Nigeria as it is in the United States of America and Ghana to be insulated from manipulations of government officials like the president, governors and hijack by money men and women.\n\nHe said though the leadership crisis might have been contained, the truth was that none of the members of the NWC was desperate to retain his or her office.\n\n\u201cThough the crisis has been sorted out, but there is the need to say clearly that the members of the NWC are not desperate to stay in office beyond December 9, 2021, constitutionallyrecognised four years in office. The PDP constitution clearly stated that the tenure of all NWC members are four years guaranteed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the NWC can recontest, if they desire to do so. This is the constitutional right, which no one can deny them. It is left for the delegates to elect them or say so.\n\n\u201cThis constitution since it was amended is deposited with INEC and further to that the Electoral act as amended insisted that all tenures of the NWC of any political party, including the PDP must be tenure guaranteed\n\n\u201cApart from that, all NWC of any political party must be elective and therefore, there is no provisions or provision that guaranteed the establishment of caretaker committee. What is happening in the APC is because of the fact that it is the ruling party and the respect or privilege INEC has for President Muhammadu Buhari. It\u2019s a constitutional aberration,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source said what was needed now is a law that would guarantee the independence of INEC and insulate the political parties from manipulations as the case in the United States of America and Ghana, \u201cthen our democracy would have been said to be established\u201d, adding, \u201cThis is a challenge that we are throwing to the National Assembly and when this is done, we can say that we are truly an amazing democratic nation.\u201d\n\nOn the main reason for the crisis in the PDP, the source said, \u201cIt is all about the struggle for the 2023 general election. See, we were elected in 2017. 2018 gone, no crisis and after the elections of 2019 and basically in 2020, there was covid-19 lockdown. In 2021, there is the power struggle for the repositioning of interest and some money bags; they believe that this is the time to hijack the party, so as to actualise their political ambitions.\n\n\u201cIf the political parties, including the PDP is insulated from the influence of money bags and governors, the parties would be protected. That is to say, if they are insulated from government officials and the governors, the democratic system would have been better off for it,\u201d the source said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "With Planned Dividend Payout, NNPC Prepares for Life Outside FG\u2019s Control",
          "text": "\u2022Corporation\u2019s April expenditure rises by 17.2% to N492.05bn\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is assiduously working towards the payment of dividends to its shareholders, notably the federal, state and local governments, to satisfy one of the conditions for listing on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\nWithin the first six months of the operation of the new petroleum legislation, expected to be signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari any time soon, the Minister of Petroleum Resources, being the president, is mandated under the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to incorporate the NNPC as a limited liability company to be known as NNPC Limited, to fully commercialise its operations.\n\nNigerians were shocked recently to hear the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr. Mele Kyari, declare in public on three separate occasions that the corporation which has consistently operated at a loss plans to pay dividends like the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited.\n\nThe first instance was during an interactive session with the National Association of Energy Correspondents (NAEC) in Abuja, last November; the second was when he appeared on ARISE News Channel to clarify issues around the Dangote Refinery, and the third was last week in Lagos, while delivering an address at an event organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).\n\n\u201cEverything we are doing must align with the wider national interest. And therefore, NNPC, being the representatives of all of us and, is, of course, a very potential global player, this is our ambition and we are getting there.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you, within the next month or two maximum, we will publish our statement of accounts for 2020. And I can also confirm to you that for the first time in our history, we will declare profit to the Nigerian people,\u201d he told his audience.\n\nClause 53 of the legislation recently passed by the National Assembly, says the petroleum minister must consult with the minister of finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which would form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited.\n\nIn addition, 53 (7,8) provides that NNPC Limited must operate as an, \u201cefficient profit-making entity,\u201d declare dividends and also pay all fees, rents, royalties, profit oil share taxes and other requirements on any lease or licence.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt yesterday that to satisfy the standard for listing, which the NNPC would be mandated to do under the new law, Financial Standard \u2018A\u2019 requires that a company which wants to be listed on the main board of the exchange must provide three years financial statements, the most recent of which must not be more than nine months old at the time of application submission.\n\nIn addition, the standard requires that company must provide financial statements with the date of the last audited accounts not being older than nine months.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Mr. Bismarck Rewane, who alluded to the process of listing in a note at the weekend, stressed that the planned action by the national oil company could be a precursor to its listing in 2022.\n\nRewane, noted that listing of the NNPC like it\u2019s Saudi Arabia counterpart, Aramco, could boost market capitalisation by as much as 65 per cent to hit N33 trillion when the deal is completed.\n\n\u201cOnly a discerning analyst would have raised his eyebrow when the NNPC announced its intention to pay its first dividend in September 2021. He would ask if this was a precursor for listing the oil behemoth on the Nigerian stock market just like Aramco did in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cAramco IPO has been the world\u2019s largest to date. To list any company on the exchange, the company must have paid dividends in the prior three years. This announcement was swiftly followed by the FEC approval of NNPC\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical project.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are not only huge but are potentially transformational for the petroleum sector in Nigeria, which had been hitherto in a moribund state.\n\n\u201cThe governance requirements of listed companies is likely to force the NNPC to become more transparent and accountable in its financial management,\u201d Rewane said.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC in its April 2021 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), released yesterday, stated that its expenditure for the month under review increased by 17.24 per cent or N72.34 billion to N492.05 billion.\n\nThe national oil company also announced a trading surplus of N43.57 billion in April 2021, representing a 23.64 per cent increase over the N35.24 billion surplus it recorded in the previous month of March 2021. It also clarified that its calculation of trading surplus or trading deficit was derived after deduction of the expenditure profile from the revenue for the period under review.\n\nAccording to the report, the NNPC\u2019s operating revenue in April 2021, as compared to March 2021, increased by 17.73 per cent or N80.67 billion to stand at N535.61 billion. The NNPC attributed the rise in trading surplus to the activities of the corporation\u2019s upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), such as crude oil lifting from OML 119 (Okono Okpoho) and OMLs 60, 61, 62, 63 (Nigerian Agip Oil Company), as well as increase in gas sales.\n\n\u201cThe positive outlook was further consolidated by the robust gains of two other subsidiaries namely: Duke Oil and the National Engineering and Technical Company (NETCO),\u201d it stated.\n\nIn the downstream, to ensure uninterrupted supply and effective distribution of fuel across the country, it stated that a total of 1.67 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or petrol translating to 55.79 million litres/day were supplied in the month under review.\n\nThe report also showed a 34.29 per cent reduction in the number of pipelines vandalised from 70 in March 2021, to 46 in April 2021. While Port Harcourt area accounted for 54 per cent, Mosimi area accounted for 46 per cent of the vandalised points.\n\nIn the gas sector, a total of 209.27 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas was produced in the month under review, translating to an average daily production of 6,975.72million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd).\n\nFor the period of April 2020 to April 2021, NNPC noted that a total of 2,902.52bcf of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,369.76mmscfd during the period.\n\n\u201cPeriod-to-date production from Joint Ventures (JVs), Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and NPDC contributed about 62.07 per cent, 19.95 per cent and 17.98 per cent respectively to the total national gas production.\n\n\u201cIn terms of natural gas off-take, commercialisation and utilisation, out of the 206.40bcf supplied in April 2021, a total of 126.83bcf of gas was commercialised consisting of 42.92bcf and 83.91bcf for the domestic and export markets respectively.\n\n\u201cThis translates to a total supply of 1,430.90mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 2,976.94mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month.\n\n\u201cThis implies that 61.45 per cent of the average daily gas produced was commercialised while the balance of 38.55 per cent was either re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared. Gas flare rate was 9.74 per cent for the month under review (i.e. 670.19mmscfd) compared with average gas flare rate of 7.42 per cent (i.e. 542.22mmscfd) for the period of April 2020 to April 2021,\u201d it noted.\n\nAccording to the national oil company, a total of 795mmscfd was delivered to gas-fired power plants in the month of April 2021 to generate an average power of about 3,416 MW.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Targets 3m jobs\n\n\u2022Absence of cars for conversion, high gas price hurting autogas initiative\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe federal government has commenced the implementation of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) N250 billion intervention fund for the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP), which is expected to create about three million direct and indirect jobs.\n\nHowever, findings by THISDAY has revealed that the federal government\u2019s plan to enthrone an alternative energy regime in the country through its autogas policy may be heading for failure owing to apathy now observed among the petroleum products marketers towards the initiative.\n\nThe intervention facility for the NGEP, which is targeted at stimulating finance to the critical sector and motivate investment in the gas value chain being funded by the apex bank, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Mr. Bitrus Nabasu, disclosed at the weekend that the process of receiving applications from potential beneficiaries to access the facility had commenced.\n\nHe stated that the fund was available to finance the establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants, gas cylinder manufacturing plants, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) regasification modular systems, automatic conversion kits or components manufacturing plants, CNG primary and secondary compression stations, as well as micro distribution outlets and service centres of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales.\n\nNabasu, noted that the intervention fund was designed to meet certain objectives, including improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain and stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise domestic gas resources for It also set out to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nAccording to Nabasu, the fund would equally provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market, boost employment across the countrh and fast-track the development of gas-based industries, particularly petrochemical (fertiliser and methanol, among others).\n\nThis is with a view to supporting large industries such as agriculture, textile and related industries.\n\nThe fund, he added, would service the development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure, enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets, and any other mid to downstream gas value chain-related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary said: \u201cIt is expected that parties with the capacity to develop and operate any of the afore-listed projects would need to demonstrate project development experience.\n\n\u201cIn addition, interested parties will need to demonstrate technical and commercial capacity.\u201d\n\nNabasu stressed that interested applicants were required to demonstrate evidences of experience and capabilities in their proposed businesses in order to access the fund.\n\nHe urged interested applicants to provide at least general information about them, particularly experiences and evidence of technical competence as well as organisationall structure.\n\nGiving further details, Brenda Ataga, who is the Senior Technical Assistant on Gas Development and Investment to the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said the fund was launched August 2020 by the CBN, adding that since then 27 applications had been recorded on the high capital expenditure portion which has an obligor limit of N10 billion, while 50 applications were received from the small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) side.\n\nThe SMEs support portion, she disclosed, has a limit of N50 million, broken into start-ups and experienced applicants.\n\nShe disclosed that evaluation of applicants would be based on seven fundamental areas.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our evaluation covers seven fundamental areas which must be evidenced by applicants, and it is very important that this is stated to the applicants because people have sent us all sorts of applications that are not in line with the recommended framework for evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe essence is for us in the ministry to support the propagation of gas and also creation of jobs through access to financing,\u2019\u2019 she said\n\nSMEs, she added, would also follow similar structure, noting that start-ups would enjoy some leniency in the financial model.\n\nStating that SMEs will prove that they are registered in Nigeria, pay their taxes, prove affiliation to first-class companies which are already established businesses with good track records within the gas value chain, she pointed out that there was no deadline for filing of applications.\n\nAccording to her, some preferential treatment would be accorded indigenous companies as well as gender-based considerations for companies in the SMEs\u2019 category.\n\nAtaga noted that one of the positives to be derived from the fund is its potential to support government\u2019s drive to reduce greenhouse gases by a minimum of 50 per cent.\n\nAbsence of Converted Cars, High Gas Price Hurting FG\u2019s Autogas Initiative\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government\u2019s plan to enthrone an alternative energy regime in the country through its autogas policy may be heading for failure owing to apathy now observed among the petroleum products marketers towards the initiative.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the absence of sufficient number of cars converted from petrol-powered to either Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-powered in the country and the high cost of gas was dampening marketers\u2019 interest in investing in the building and setting up of autogas filling stations.\n\nIn addition, the seeming failure of the federal government to convert about one million vehicles between December 2020, when the NGEP and the autogas initiative were launched, to December 2021, has further contributed to the marketers\u2019 disinterest to continue with their investment in the programme.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, had promised that the government was going to assist Nigerians to convert their cars free of charge.\n\nBut Sylva\u2019s Technical Adviser on Gas Business and Policy Implementation, Mr. Justice Derefaka, had said the conversion of cars, which he estimated was to cost between N200,000 and N250,000 for one car, was to be borne by each vehicle owner.\n\nHowever, some of the marketers who spoke to THISDAY over the weekend on conditions of anonymity, said they would not take the risk of borrowing huge sums of money to invest in autogas stations when they were not sure of those to patronize them.\n\nThey argued that contrary to what it said, the federal has not been able to convert the one million vehicles they boasted they were going to convert before December 2021, adding that no business man ventures into a business where there is no market for his goods or services.\n\nOne of the marketers who belongs to the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) said though the CBN had given them a repayment term of 10 years for the loan, it was no enough to attract them to go and borrow and invest in autogas facilities.\n\nSylva announced recently in Kano that the government had immediately reduced the domestic base price of natural gas to power plant producers from $2.50 cent to $2.18 cent per standard cubic feet (scf).\n\nHowever, efforts made by THISDAY to get either the Ministry of Petroleum or the NNPC to react to the issues, particularly the extent reached with the cars conversion, proved abortive as neither of them took their phone calls or replied texts sent them.\n\nShare this:

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to Premium Times, Onu says it was necessitated by Buhari\u2019s approval of the National Science, Technology and Innovation Roadmap (NSTIR 2017-2030).\n\nThe new name is to reflect the spirit of the document \u2014 driving positive socio-economic outcomes through science, technology, and innovation in all activities of the economy. He said the name change was to facilitate economic growth and global competitiveness and make Nigeria a nation of innovators.\n\nWill this truly help?

Hover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers\n\nIn the early 2000s, Africa\u2019s policymakers made significant strides to tackle this issue, but the game changed in 2009 with the launch of the MainOne cable on the West African coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by CEO Funke Opeke\u2019s passion for connecting Africa to the Internet, MainOne\u2019s feat initiated a boost to Internet speeds that seemingly aided the proliferation of startups and tech-enabled businesses in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s most developed tech ecosystems.\n\nRecognising another apparent gap, the company subsequently launched a series of data centre facilities, through its subsidiary, MDXi, in Lagos, Nigeria, to support the myriad of businesses popping up in the nation\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nMainOne is not resting on its laurels, as MDXi announced its data centre facility expansion to Appolonia City in Greater Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, data centres are facilities that house computer systems and other components like telecommunications and storage systems.\n\nLike fibre optic cables, and base transceiver stations (telecom masts), data centres are a critical part of the global Internet infrastructure.\n\nThese centres process large amounts of data and host websites, manage emails, and even help instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram run effectively. Data centres are grouped in tiers, with tier 1 being the simplest and Tier 4 being the most advanced.\n\nA 2020 researchandmarkets.com report titled Data Center Market in Africa \u2013 Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026 reveals that Africa has invested up to $2 billion in data centres and will reach $5 billion by 2026.\n\nThe report argues that the rise in data traffic caused by COVID-19 will further increase African businesses and governments\u2019 demand for data centres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, few African countries are cloud-ready, considering constraints from a lack of inland and submarine fibre and power availability.\n\nResearchandmarkets.com states that economic heavyweights like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia will witness significant growth in data centre activities. Still, several countries with those constraints could miss out on this growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction in Ghana?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainOne\u2019s data centre launch in Ghana\n\nMainOne\u2019s past initiatives suggest launching its data centre in Ghana as a natural progression that aligns with its connectivity ambitions.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched its second data centre \u2014 the first outside Nigeria \u2014 in Ivory Coast, one of West Africa\u2019s major economic hubs. Through this move, MainOne solidified its intention to oil the engine of Ivory Coast\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIn an exhaustive chat with Techpoint Africa in July 2020, Funke Opeke hinted that MainOne would be expanding its data centre footprint to Shagamu, Ogun State \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s second most industrialised state \u2014 and other West African countries.\n\nTrue to her words, MainOne has seemingly set its sights on Ghana.\n\nBacked by a large population, a vast economy, and increasing digitisation, Nigeria has grabbed the major headlines for West Africa\u2019s tech-related activities.\n\nHowever, past events also suggest that African tech companies planning to expand nearly always have Ghana in their sights. Recent examples include Nigeria\u2019s GIG Logistics and Cars45, and Kenya\u2019s Quickbus.\n\nWhy?\n\nGhana is West Africa\u2019s second-largest economy, and about 57% (17.6 million) of its 31 million population are below the age of 25, while over 14 million out of 18 million adults are literate. The country is home to startups like mPharma, Jetstream, Bace Group, OZ\u00c9 , and Nvoicia.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched its 5th Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab in Accra, Ghana and in 2021, Twitter surprisingly chose Ghana to launch its first African office.\n\nBesides, the Ghanaian government recently started introducing forward-thinking digital projects.\n\nFollowing the pandemic\u2019s onset, in July 2020, it began building a digital template for elections using the African Union\u2019s proprietary technology \u2014 the PanaBIOS online platform.Seven months later, in February 2021, it piloted a regulatory innovation sandbox for financial services companies.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, it commenced West Africa\u2019s first digital census.\n\nSuch digital activity requires fast and reliable Internet access, which is only possible with the presence of basic and advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Ghana\u2019s Internet space look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Speedtest\u2019s global Internet index, Ghana currently has the fastest fixed broadband speeds in Africa at 51.93 Mbps, ahead of South Africa (47 Mbps) and Egypt (42 Mbps).\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index is a service owned by Ookla, a US-based Internet analytics company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has the fastest broadband speeds in West Africa. It, alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal, lead the region by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, just 0.3% of Ghana\u2019s population has access to fixed broadband services, hinting at low adoption.\n\nFor mobile Internet, the numbers are slightly different. Internet World Stats reveals that, in December 2020, Ghana had a 46.5% mobile Internet penetration rate. While this is higher than the continental average of 37.42%, it falls behind 27 other African countries.\n\nAs of January 2021, Ghana reportedly has 15.7 million registered mobile Internet users. It, however, only has a mobile Internet speed of 13.8 Mbps.\n\nWhile Internet penetration has been increasing, Ghana\u2019s 79th and 132nd positions globally for fixed broadband and mobile Internet show there\u2019s significant room for improvement. Like other African countries, infrastructure remains a major challenge.\n\nHow Africa has improved its Internet speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source:\n\nDespite immense growth in recent years, several Africans still don\u2019t have access to the Internet. The continent has the slowest Internet speeds and the highest costs relative to income. This gap has presented opportunities and challenges.\n\nSince MainOne\u2019s cable launch, other submarine cables have landed in Africa to give it a combined capacity of 100 terabits, and upcoming initiatives from Google and Facebook could add 280 terabits. Still, cables are only one layer as several other challenges plague African countries.\n\nCountries like Nigeria and Kenya have taken it a step further by improving the usage of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).\n\nPer the Internet Exchange Society, websites load slowly in Africa since several of them have servers outside the continent. Encouragingly, local IXPs resolve this problem by lowering the cost and latency of accessing content from foreign websites.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2020, Nigeria and Kenya have localised 70% of Internet traffic through local IXPs, which has helped them save a combined $46 million. Other African countries have seemingly not witnessed as much success.\n\nCould MainOne push Ghana even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSince Ghana decentralised its telecom sector in the late 90s, MTN, Vodafone, and Airtel have provided healthy competition to drive Internet adoption.\n\nHowever, MainOne plans to take this a step further. The newly launched data centre will offer open access connectivity options to Ghana\u2019s leading telecom operators and direct access to the MainOne cable and other submarine cable systems.\n\nIt also offers access to Internet exchanges like the GIX (Ghana), IXPN (Nigeria), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt/Lisbon), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Internet Exchange (CIVIX), and the West Africa Internet Exchange (WAF-IX).\n\n\u201cThis creates shorter routes for internet traffic with direct access to content providers, which enables better internet resilience, reduced latency, and improved customer experience for internet users in Ghana,\u201d MainOne says.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ghana could well be on its way to localising Internet traffic, boosting its speeds, and saving millions of dollars in the process.\n\nEven more business benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Internet speeds affects individuals and businesses in Ghana, but the MDXi\u2019s other features shoot its business value up a notch.\n\nIt reportedly features private data centre suites, precision cooling, and enterprise-grade 24\u00d77 multi-level security and video surveillance. It also has safety and fire suppression systems with multiple redundancies built into the power, cooling, and security infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to eliminate the challenges businesses face with setting up IT infrastructure in-house, by presenting a shared Data Center model, which optimises cost, and improves performance and efficiency.\u201d\n\nMainOne reveals that enterprises, government agencies, multinationals, and startups can now subscribe to colocation or cloud services, which allow them to focus on their core businesses.\n\nAfricanus Mensah, Chairman, MainOne Ghana, believes that the data centre will impact Ghana\u2019s business growth and human capital development. He believes the facility will \u201cexpand the frontiers of the digital revolution and transformation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MDXi Appolonia Data Center will contribute to the growth of the local economy by providing jobs, enhancing capacity development, and serving more businesses in Ghana as the region continues to grow its digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe company reveals that as Ghana\u2019s digital economy keeps growing, the data centre facility will contribute to its growth by creating jobs and enhancing capacity development.\n\nWhile MainOne\u2019s data centre could offer several benefits for businesses and individuals in Ghana, this is only one part of the puzzle. Factors like ease of doing business, terrestrial Internet infrastructure, and a skilled workforce will prove a solid foundation for Ghana\u2019s digital economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

I am in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the governor of Edo State today largely because of his efforts and persuasion.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going through those challenges in the other political party, the senator and the Senator representing Edo Central Senatorial District, Senator Clifford Ordia approached me and said to me, my brother, don\u2019t worry, when you are ready, we have a platform for you.

And that is not attributed solely to me. In fact, the person who made it happen is our very own Senator Urhoghide.\u201d\n\nEarlier, during a thanksgiving service, the governor urged politicians to learn from the life of Senator Urhoghide whose perseverance gave him electoral victory in 2015 after 23 years of trying to make headway in politics.\n\n\u201cA lesson to learn from Sen. Urhoghide is that of perseverance. Remember he just told us that for 23 years he kept trying in politics and continued to fail but he never gave up until God answered him. When your desires are genuine God will see you through.\n\n\u201cOnce you pass through a road and make promises, always remember to go back and fulfill the promises you made. We thank God that we have a senator who is responsive to the call of his people\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Urhoghide commended the governor for his exceptional leadership in the state and the party, adding that PDP under his leadership is wearing a new shape.\n\n...",

Dr. Augustine O. Akubeze on his tenth year anniversary as an Archbishop, saluting his contributions to the development of Edo State and Nigeria.\n\nObaseki, who at the weekend led top government officials and other dignitaries to a book launch in commemoration of the archbishop\u2019s tenth year anniversary, described Akubeze as one who is readily available to provide solutions and support to the government.\n\nThe governor was joined by his deputy, Rt.

          "title": "APC convention fallout How much can Osinbajo do?",
          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nIt seems that the Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo is now in a Catch-22 situation over his stand on the recently held ward Congresses of the party following the judgment of the Supreme Court on the governorship election in Ondo State.\n\nWhile that contest was chiefly between Ogbeni Rotimi Akeredolu of the All progressives Congress (APC) and Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), its reveberations have continued one year after, both in scale and scope.\n\nThe vice President, based on the touted flaws discovered in the judgment and the technicality which saved the APC, had opposed the conduct of the ward congresses that were recently held but he was opposed by some powerful people in the cabinet and the party, that insisted the congress should yet hold.\n\nDespite the concerns over the legality of the congress, it was eventually held all over the states of the federation of Nigeria but was full of complaints, Protests and agitation by members and some leaders of the party who felt marginalized through the consensus arrangement adopted for the conduct of the congresses.\n\nThe ward congresses rather than uniting the party have therefore further widened the cracks and animosities between members and leaders, as there are claims that it is those said to have been favoured by the Mai Mala Buni Caretaker National Committee that arranged the Congresses and used it to whittle down the powers of some leaders in their states.\n\nThe crisis since the ward congress has heightened and it has further divided the party.\n\nThe main issue in contention which pitched Professor Osinbajo and others on his side against the other group led by the Attorney General of the Federation, Malami was the Supreme court judgement which raised issues over the legality of the Mai Mala Buni caretaker executive, which had signed Governor Akeredolu\u2019s nomination form to contest the election.\n\nOne of the legs of Eyitayo Jegede\u2019s Appeal was that the Governor of Yobe State, Buni had no right to sign Akeredolu\u2019s form as the chairman of the APC because he was not entitled to hold two executives offices at the same time under the Nigerian constitution and the that of his party.\n\nWhat actually saved the APC in that judgment was that technical ground that Jegede had failed to join Buni in the suit.\n\nHad it been that he did that, Akeredolu\u2019s election would have been nullified as it was actually sustained on the ground of a split judgement of 4 against 3 by the Supreme Court Justices.\n\nBut in order not to fall into the same trap going forward, Osinbajo, Festus Keyamo(SAN) Femi Ojudu and others did not therefore want the ward congresses held because it was Buni\u2019s committee that organized it and the notion was that if the Congress is challenged in court, it would create a big problem for the APC.\n\nBefore the Vice President joined the league of those who wanted the congress put on hold for now it was the Minister of State, Labour, Festus Keyamo that had first publicly pointed out the legality challenge in the Buni controversy as regards the supreme court\u2019s judgment on Akeredolu.\n\nKeyamo (SAN), had warned of the legal implications of holding the exercise following the judgement of the Supreme Court on the appeal filed by the PDP candidate in the October 2020 governorship election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede.\n\nHe argued that the little technical point that saved Gov Akeredolu was that Jegede failed to join Mai Mala Buni in the suit. Jegede was challenging the competence of Gov. Mai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.\n\nKeyamo pointed out that Jegede had drew the attention of the court in his Appeal to the fact that it is against Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution which states that \u201ca sitting Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Keyemi said, \u201chad Buni been joined in the suit, the story may have been different today as we would have lost Ondo State to the PDP.\u201d\n\nApart from the minister, the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Babafemi Ojudu and the Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, in a joint statement , also warned the party of the dire consequences should it go ahead with the congresses.\n\nThey argued that if the caretaker committee organised the congresses, it could lead to legal tussles which would affect the party in 2023.\n\nDespite all these warnings,, the APC ignored them and went ahead saying that the trio were merely expressing their \u2018personal opinions which would have little effect on the legitimacy of the party\u2019s interim leadership.\n\nAccording to the APC interim National Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe,\u201dwe stand with our National Chairman, we will go ahead with the congresses as planned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201dThe clarification is against the backdrop of personal opinions being expressed by some individuals on the status of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and its capacity to conduct the Congresses.\n\n\u201cWhile it is not our intention to join issues with these commentators, the Supreme Court\u2019s Wednesday judgement affirming the Election victory of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu SAN had no bearing on the CECPC\u2019s status and its membership.\u201d\n\nNow that the congress has been held it has however not fully dispelled the scare created in the party as some members are not happy.\n\nIt has not only divided the party, it has also created a gulf in the Federal Executive Council as members are with different opinions on the Supreme Court judgment and the conduct of the ward congresses.\n\nThe issue was said to have been raised at the Federal executive council meeting where the Vice President Osinbajo held firmly to his stand that the party was not favoured legally by its holding the ward congress and subsequent elections under the present leadership of Buni at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nIt was learnt that up till now, the vice president has not changed his position on the committee.\n\nIt was said that Professor Osinbajo took an informed position after analysing the Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo governorship election and his stand has remained the same.\n\nSources hinted that the vice president was very clear and told the council that the APC should do everything possible to avoid legal trap and address the main issue raised, which is against the country\u2019s constitution and section 17 of the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe source further hinted that some minister, especially those who were lawyers in the cabinet argued along the line of the position of Osinbajo, but it was only the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami. that held a contrary view.\n\nBusiness hallmark also reliably learnt that right now the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari is sharply divided along two groups of Professor Osinbajo and Malami, while it would take the intervention of President Buhari to get the issue resolved. when he comes back. from London where he went to receive medical attention.\n\nMalami was said to have supported that the status quo, be maintained and asked the party not to succumb to what he described as speculative and unsubstantiated fears concerning the status of Buni as the caretaker chairman.\n\nThe Supreme Court had in a split judgement on July 28 upheld the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and dismissed the appeal of the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) candidate, Eyitayo Jegede for lack of \u201cany scintilla of merit.\u201d\n\nJegede and the PDP had challenged the October 10, 2020 governorship election and pegged their main relief on the ground that Governor Akeredolu and his deputy, Orimisan Aiyedatiwa, were not qualified to contest the election.\n\nThey contended that the signing of Akeredolu\u2019s nomination certificate (exhibit P21) by the APC\u2019s caretaker committee led by Governor Buni of Yobe State was invalid based on section 183 of the Nigerian constitution, 1999 and Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nBoth the majority judgement of four justices and the minority judgement of three justices concurred that Governor Buni had violated section 183 of the constitution, which holds that, \u201cThe governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever,\u201d as well as Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution, which holds that, \u201cNo officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position in government concurrently.\u201d\n\nHowever, the majority judgement read by Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim submitted that the contention, being one with grave consequences for the governor involving the determination of the constitutional issue of his action, would be unfair to try in his absence.\n\n\u201cThe fair trial of such issue in his absence without joining him as a party is impossible. There is no need to stress the point that he is a necessary party to the case because the issue upon which the appellants have predicated their case, namely, the invalidity of the said exhibit itself cannot be fairly, effectually and conclusively be determined without joining him as a party to the case,\u201d Agim said.\n\nIn his reaction to the legality of Buni\u2019s leadership of the party David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, has said the caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is constitutional.\n\nA statement by Francis Nwaze, the governors Press Secretary \u201cthe governor while assessing the just concluded congresses in his state, said the caretaker arrangement put together by the party was in line with the party\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201dWhen that opinion was expressed, I had to go through the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the constitution of the party, as a section of the party\u2019s constitution empowers the National Executive Committee to set up a caretaker committee and this caretaker committee is to do the job of any of the organs of the party where there is vacancy or vacancies.\u201d",
          "summary": "The crisis since the ward congress has heightened and it has further divided the party.\nWhat actually saved the APC in that judgment was that technical ground that Jegede had failed to join Buni in the suit.\nMai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.\nIt was said that Professor Osinbajo took an informed position after analysing the Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo governorship election and his stand has remained the same.\nIn his reaction to the legality of Buni\u2019s leadership of the party David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, has said the caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is constitutional.",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Determined Ozigbo pushes to upstage troubled APGA",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen he first stepped into the fray, Valentine Chineto Ozigbo must have seemed like one of those hardly consequential participants there to make up the numbers \u2013 his professional pedigree notwithstanding \u2013 but today the candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra has more than proven he means business.\n\nThere is a sense of Deja Vu, many say, in Ozigbo\u2019s candidacy. The general feeling is that it has brought back memories of the youthful Peter Obi, the immediate past governor of the state who at 42 in 2003, left his thriving boardroom career \u2013 he was chairman of Fidelity Bank Plc, among other top positions \u2013 to join the Anambra governorship race under the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nAt the time, many people could have concluded that he stood little chance, given the dominance of the then ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and it\u2019s demonstrated capacity to win by the hook or crook.\n\nObi, who had resisted attempts to lure him into politics by Prof. ABC Nwosu, was eventually convinced when called upon by the founder of Kellogg Graduate School, Professor Dean Jacobs to go back to his country and participate in building public wealth, \u201cbecause public wealth enriches everybody, but private wealth impoverishes everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Obi contested in 2003, nobody gave him a chance,\u201d recalled Mr. Collins Okek, head, public sector practice group, Olisa Agbakoba Legal. \u201cBut he won, even though he was rigged out. So, Ozigbo might cause a bit of an upset in November.\u201d\n\nObi, in 2014, handed over to Chief Willie Obiano, himself a technocrat whose career had spanned from First Bank of Nigeria, to Chevron and later Fidelity Bank, but who has largely failed to replicate his predecessor\u2019s performance in many people\u2019s reckoning, even as the state now has accumulated domestic debt of N60bn, up from N3bn in 2014.\n\nAs Obiano prepares to hand over to the next governor early next year, many are longing for a return to the Obi years, and Ozigbo \u2013 who at 51, has accumulated a wealth of experience in the private sector, having worked as banker for over 17 years, going from NAL Merchant Bank, Diamond Bank, Continental Trust Bank, FSB International Bank, Standard Trust Bank to United Bank for Africa and Bank PHB, before branching out into the hospitality industry where he served as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Transcorp Hotels Plc, from where he became its President and Chief Executive Officer in 2019 \u2013 fits the bill in many people\u2019s opinions.\n\n\u201cOzigbo is another Peter Obi,\u201d said Mr. Oliver Nwafor, a political enthusiast based in Awka, the state capital. \u201cI think he will do well in the election. People tend to like him because he is humble and seem to be prepared to govern.\u201d\n\nNwafor\u2019s conviction shared by Obi himself, who today is the leader of the PDP in the state, and has been canvassing support for Mr. Ozigbo, as he hopes the party will do better than it did in 2017, when Obiano defeated its candidate Mr. Oseloka Obaze and candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) to retain his seat.\n\n\u201cOzigbo candidacy is divine and ordained by God for the position and there is nothing we can do other than to support him,\u201d Obi told party stakeholders in the state on Thursday a fortnight ago.\n\nOzigbo had scaled the first major huddle by emerging candidate of the PDP ahead of many other formidable aspirants under the party\u2019s platform, including Anambra Central senator, Uche Ekwunife; former member of the House of Reps, Tony Nwoye, as well as U.S. based billionaire medical doctor, Godwin Maduka, among others.\n\nBut he has had to contend with series of court litigation, as Senator Ugochukwu Uba who emerged candidate of a parallel primary continues to lay claim to being the authentic candidate of the party.\n\nThe series of court judgments emanating there-from, however, appear to have now been settled with the judgment of a Court of Appeal in Abuja which reinstated the Ndubuisi Nwobu-led executive \u2013 which was initially sacked by an Abuja High Court following a suit instituted by Samuel Anyakorah, and replaced by Chukwudi Umeaba, whose faction recognised Senator Uba \u2013 thereby validating the candidature of Mr. Ozigbo.\n\nThe PDP candidate, barring other intra-party controversies, will now focus on the ultimate prize; the goal of beating other candidates on November 6.\n\nAs candidate of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, which has massive support in Anambra, he stands on a strong footing. Yet, his humility and ability to address issues have endeared him to many of the state\u2019s populace, some of whom accuse his key rival, Soludo of being too elitist and aloof, even as the backing of Mr. Obi may be an added advantage.\n\n\u201cOzigbo is popular, also based on the popularity of his party, the PDP,\u201d said Chidi Odogwu, a business owner in Onitsha. \u201cHe has a chance of beating Soludo, because a lot of people see Soludo as being too elitist.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, it won\u2019t be as straightforward because politics is a game of strength. I think Soludo has an upper hand because of APGA. APGA has the structure, and Soludo, regardless of the assertions that he is too elitist, is also very popular.\u201d\n\nOzigbo will face the APGA candidate former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo, and other candidates, in what is a battle of Anambra South Senatorial District; the Old Aguata Zone; the zone which is to produce the next governor of the state in line with its informal zoning arrangement.\n\nIt is generally a four-horse race, featuring Ozigbo, Soludo, candidates of the PDP and APGA, respectively; as well as Dr. Ifeanyi Ubah, candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) and Senator Andy Uba, candidate of the country\u2019s ruling party, the APC. But it is one which Soludo and Ozigbo stand shoulders higher above the rest, as the two leading candidates.\n\n\u201cI think the battle is actually going to be between Soludo and the Ozigbo; that is between APGA and PDP,\u201d said Mr. Okeke. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it will eventually play out, but it is clearly a battle between the PDP and APGA. Still, the dynamic is such that APGA appears to be on ground. They have the structure; they have been around for quite some time and that\u2019s a big advantage.\u201d\n\nAPGA has been in power in Anambra for 15 years, from 2006 when Obi became governor. And every attempt by the PDP and more recently, APC to topple its rule has fallen through. The party has built structures in the state over the years, but it has also become increasingly weakened by its own internal contradictions.\n\nFormed initially to serve as a rallying point for the Igbo in the contest for power in Nigeria, the party has since evolved, with many alleging that it\u2019s since become a platform used to make money by its leadership.\n\nToday, from Chief Chekwas Okorie, who originally founded the party, to Bianca Ojukwu, wife of the late Emeka Ojukwu who was the moral and psychological force behind the party, as well as Mr. Obi, its first governor, most of the founding fathers have ditched it on account of irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe party continues to battle crisis, which has also become prominent in the lead up to the election, over the emergence of Soludo as candidate, with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) initially listing Michael Umeoji, who emerged candidate of the Jude Okeke led faction, over Soludo as the APGA candidate, in compliance with the decision of a Jigawa High Court that recognised the faction as the authentic faction.\n\nThe Jigawa High Court decision, was however, eventually reversed by Justice Charles Okaa of an Awka High Court who affirmed Soludo as authentic candidate; a decision that has also been upheld by an Appeal Court, Awka division, which last week struck out an application challenging the judgment of the Awka High Court.\n\nThe court matter appears to have been settled for the moment, but the rifts remain. And it\u2019s these contradictions that the PDP and Ozigbo may hope to exploit to win power.\n\n\u201cSome of the bigwigs in APGA are not backing Soludo, that might be a problem,\u201d said Odogwu. \u201cBut I think the party still has an upper hand.\u201d\n\nThe PDP nonetheless, has its own challenges too, with crisis rocking it from state to national level.\n\n\u201cThe PDP did well in the last election and will hope to replicate that in November,\u201d said Mr. Okeke. \u201cBut the problem PDP will have is that the governorship election in a one-off election, not like the general election of 2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, a lot of people voted for the PDP because they didn\u2019t want to vote for the APC given the way Buhari was performing. People didn\u2019t want to vote for Buhari, so they voted massively for the PDP. Again, Peter Obi was also on the ballot. This time, he will not be. So, the dynamics is different. But his support for Ozigbo may also count.\u201d\n\nFor Okeke, apart from Soludo and Ozigbo, the only other candidate that may possibly swing a surprise is YPP candidate, Ubah.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think APC is even in the fight at all; I don\u2019t think Andy Uba will make much impression, except something goes wrong, but I don\u2019t think it will happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe other person that may swing a surprise, which many people may not realise is Ifeanyi Ubah, though his party YPP is not as strong and I\u2019m not also sure that many people in Anambra will be keen to trust him with the state treasury.\n\n\u201cBut you never know, anything can happen. Ubah is popular in his Nnewi constituency, whether that will be enough is another story.",

He\u2019s no good news for APC if the party is to retain power in 2023,\u201d Gololo said.\n\nHe said the CECPC led by the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, must also learn from the mistakes of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which sacrificed its glory to filthy lucre by admitting into its ranks persons who later showed an uncanny proclivity to sink the ship they were captains to, in order to advance their interest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhile Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno State has proven to be a man of means who has considerable wealth to throw around so as to get what he wants, his antecedent in the PDP as well as in the now defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) has left no sensible person in doubt as to his \u2018sail and sink with me\u2019 style of administration.\n\n\u201cRemember that as the national chairman of the PDP, Sheriff displayed a lack of tolerance for internal dispute resolution mechanisms and dragged the party through a tortious legal battle that eventually ruptured the unity of the party.\n\n\u201cBut for the judgment of a three-member panel of the Supreme Court presided by former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, Modu Sheriff\u2019s antics would have spelt doom for the once vibrant PDP.\n\n\u201cThe court in her judgment criticised Modu Sheriff for demonstrating an infantile desperation to lead the PDP by filing almost 10 different applications in various courts.\n\n\u201cDoes a leopard change its spots.

He\u2019s no good news for APC if the party is to retain power in 2023,\u201d Gololo said.\n\nHe said the CECPC led by the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, must also learn from the mistakes of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which sacrificed its glory to filthy lucre by admitting into its ranks persons who later showed an uncanny proclivity to sink the ship they were captains to, in order to advance their interest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhile Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno State has proven to be a man of means who has considerable wealth to throw around so as to get what he wants, his antecedent in the PDP as well as in the now defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) has left no sensible person in doubt as to his \u2018sail and sink with me\u2019 style of administration.\n\n\u201cRemember that as the national chairman of the PDP, Sheriff displayed a lack of tolerance for internal dispute resolution mechanisms and dragged the party through a tortious legal battle that eventually ruptured the unity of the party.\n\n\u201cBut for the judgment of a three-member panel of the Supreme Court presided by former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, Modu Sheriff\u2019s antics would have spelt doom for the once vibrant PDP.\n\n\u201cThe court in her judgment criticised Modu Sheriff for demonstrating an infantile desperation to lead the PDP by filing almost 10 different applications in various courts.\n\n\u201cDoes a leopard change its spots. Is he aiming to repeat in APC what he did in PDP?,\u201d Gololo queried.\n\nCalling on stakeholders not to allow detractors to return the party to the path of turmoil in the recent past, the APC Chieftain asserted that \u201cthe likes of Sheriff must be kept away from hijacking the party\u2019s leadership in any form, or at any level.\u201d\n\nHe also advised former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Almakura, one of the aspirants for the chairmanship position of the party, to work with other stakeholders towards \u201cbuilding a strong and reliable APC that would give Nigerians the much desired development.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that although Al-Makura is \u201ca better option than Sheriff, the party would be stronger, and more prosperous if piloted by a leader with wide reach and a consolidated political capital across the country.\u201d",

          "text": "Agency Report\n\nThe UN new climate report has flagged two major sectors of Nigeria\u2019s economy: cattle farming and the oil and gas industry.\n\nTo save the planet, scientists want countries involved in the two sectors to curb methane gas emission associated with them.\n\nThey also declared that cutting methane emissions is a much faster route to reduce global warming than cutting carbon emissions.\n\nIn four decades of climate negotiations, the world has focused intensely and exclusively on carbon dioxide.\n\nThis year, scientists are urging a focus on another potent greenhouse gas \u2013 methane \u2013 as the planet\u2019s best hope for staving off catastrophic global warming.\n\nCountries must make \u201cstrong, rapid and sustained reductions\u201d in methane emissions in addition to slashing CO2 emissions, scientists warn in a landmark report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Monday.\n\nThe plea is expected to cause consternation in countries opting for natural gas as a cleaner alternative to CO2-belching coal.\n\nIt also could pose challenges for countries such as Nigeria, where agriculture and livestock, especially cattle, are important industries.\n\nBut while both methane and CO2 warm the atmosphere, the two greenhouse gases are not equal.\n\nA single CO2 molecule causes less warming than a methane molecule, but lingers for hundreds of years in the atmosphere whereas methane disappears within two decades.\n\nThe report puts \u201ca lot of pressure on the world to step up its game on methane,\u201d said IPCC report reviewer Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cCutting methane is the single biggest and fastest strategy for slowing down warming,\u201d Zaelke said.\n\nToday\u2019s average global temperature is already 1.1C higher than the preindustrial average, thanks to emissions pumped into the air since the mid-1800s.\n\nBut the world would have seen an additional 0.5C of warming, had skies not been filled with pollution reflecting some of the sun\u2019s radiation back out into space, the report says.\n\nAs the world shifts away from fossil fuels and tackles air pollution, those aerosols will disappear \u2013 and temperatures could spike.\n\nQuickly reducing methane could \u201ccounteract\u201d this effect, while also improving air quality, said IPCC report summary author Maisa Rojas Corradi, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chile.\n\nOn a global scale, methane emissions are responsible for around 30% of warming since the pre-industrial era, according to the United Nations.\n\nBut the role of methane, aerosols and other short-lived climate pollutants had not been discussed by the IPCC until now.\n\n\u201cThe report draws attention to the immediate benefits of significant reductions in methane, both from an atmospheric concentration point of view, but also the co-benefits to human health from improved air quality,\u201d said Jane Lubchenco, deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nMETHANE MOMENTUM\n\nUpdates in technology and recent research suggest that methane emissions from oil and gas production, landfills and livestock have likely been underestimated.\n\nThe report sends a loud signal to countries that produce and consume oil and gas that they need to incorporate \u201caggressive oil and gas methane reduction plans into their own climate strategies,\u201d said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy at Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nLandfill and energy company emissions might be the easiest to tackle, he said.\n\nLarge-scale agricultural methane is tougher, because scaled-up replacement technology does not exist.\n\nThe EU is proposing laws this year that will force oil and gas companies to monitor and report methane emissions and to repair any leaks.\n\nThe United States is expected to unveil methane regulations by September that are more stringent than rules issued by the Obama administration, which were then rolled back under former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe United States and the EU account for more than a third of global consumption of natural gas.\n\nBut major economies without strict regulations on oil and gas production or agriculture, such as Brazil and Russia, are also likely to be high methane emitters, said IPCC co-author Paulo Artaxo, an environmental physicist at University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201c(Methane) leakage from gas and also oil wells is very difficult to quantify,\u201d he said. If countries are not looking, they will not find it.\n\nSome environmental groups and government officials have urged a global agreement on methane, such as the Montreal Protocol that tackled ozone depletion.\n\nSuch an agreement could start with methane from the oil and gas industry, which already has technology to curb those emissions, said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based climate technology group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. There\u2019s no exotic technology required here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let\u2019s start there.\u201d",

          "title": "Why Kenya \u2018Extradited\u2019 Nnamdi Kanu To Nigeria Instead Of UK -Lawyer",
          "text": "Aloy Ejimakor, the lawyer for Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, has complained that Nigeria tricked Kenya into expelling the separatist.\n\nHe clarified in a statement released on Sunday that the pro-Biafra protester is \u201ctechnically still in Kenya.\u201d\n\nKanu should have been expelled to Kenya rather than Nigeria, according to Ejimakor, because he traveled to Kenya on a British passport.\n\nEjimakor, in a statement he signed entitled: \u201cKanu is technically still in Kenya,\u201d said it was dubious that Kenya attributed Kanu\u2019s citizenship to Nigeria because it\u2019s his place of birth.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right: In the purest interpretations of foreign relations law, as applied to Britain and Kenya, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is technically speaking, still in Kenya. How? Dual national or not, Kanu departed Britain and travelled to Kenya as a British citizen and Kenya admitted him as such. That\u2019s the starting point.\n\n\u201cSo, after his admission to Kenya, it happens that Kanu must be expelled from Kenyan soil (with or without due process), the next natural and legal thing to do is for Kenya to expel him to Britain, not Nigeria. Choosing to expel him to Nigeria means that he could\u2019ve also been expelled to any other country than Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because Kanu presented himself to Kenya as a British citizen, not a Nigerian citizen or even a dual citizen. In international law, it was clearly a three-way immigration contract between Kanu, Britain and Kenya. Nigeria was not a party to it; and Nigeria was never in reckoning at the Kenyan port of entry when Kanu presented himself for admission. Lawyers call it the privity of contract.\n\n\u201cCounting from the time of Kanu\u2019s abduction to the infamous rendition, Kenya sighted no other travel document that could\u2019ve, in addition to Britain, attributed another nationality to Kanu, including that of Nigeria. Or, was Kanu admitted to Kenya on a Nigerian birth certificate?\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s dubious that Kenya attributed Nigerian citizenship to Kanu because sponsors of the abduction and rendition presumably told Kenya that Kanu was born in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKanu, 53, was arrested in late 2015 after calling for a separate homeland for the Igbo people in southeast Nigeria.\n\nIn 2017, he jumped bail, reappearing in Israel and Britain.\n\nOn June 29, Nigeria\u2019s justice minister and attorney general, Abubakar Malami, announced Kanu had been \u201cbrought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial after disappearing.\u201d\n\nThe government said last month that Kanu was \u201cbrought back\u201d to Nigeria in order to face justice, but gave no details. His family and lawyers say he was taken in Kenya.\n\nHis charges include \u201cterrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal posession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others,\u201d Malami said.",

          "text": "The allegation that troops of OPSH told residents that they had no instruction to repel invaders during attacks on some communities in Bassa LGA of Plateau State is false, unfounded, and malicious.\n\nMilitary Information Officer, Major Ishaku Gaji Takwa in a statement insisted that the allegation is not only false and baseless but a malicious and futile attempt to once again malign the good work troops of Operation SAFE HAVEN (OPSH) have been doing to restore normalcy to troubled areas in line with its operational mandate.\n\nThe spokesperson was reacting to a publication by a national daily on Sunday that troops told community leaders that they did not get instructions from the high command of the OPSH to repel invaders that attacked their communities.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cit is pertinent to note that OPSH is committed to safeguarding lives and property in line with global best practices of adhering to rules of engagement (ROE), standard operating procedure (SOP) , and respect for fundamental human rights of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cFor the records, OPSH deploys in a joint operation involving all security agencies whose mandate is to bring lasting peace on the Plateau and environs. It is practically impossible to issue out orders to troops and for them not to respond to any distress situation aimed at saving the lives and property of law-abiding citizens considering that they are drawn from all the security agencies, cutting across ethnic, religious divides and under oath to maintain peace and security in the nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the submission that troops have not been given permission to protect communities is not only false but wicked as the mandate of OPSH is explicitly clear on what should be done in an event of such an unfortunate situation in line with the SOP.

          "title": "Sudan Recalls Ambassador to Ethiopia Amid Frayed Ties",
          "text": "Sudan has recalled its ambassador to neighbouring Ethiopia, frustrated by the stance of Ethiopian officials whom it said were refusing Khartoum\u2019s offer to mediate in the ongoing conflict in Tigray.\n\n\u201cEthiopia will improve its position if it considered what Sudan could do \u2026 instead of completely rejecting all of its efforts,\u201d a statement from the foreign ministry read on Sunday.\n\nSudan\u2019s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday about the conflict in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray.\n\nHamdok\u2019s offer came within the framework of his presidency of IGAD, a grouping that includes Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti, Sudan, Uganda and Somalia, the statement said.\n\nKhartoum\u2019s move was the latest sign of deteriorating ties between the two neighbours. The tensions began after Sudan deployed troops to its border with Ethiopia late last year.\n\nThe decades-long border dispute between Sudan and Ethiopia centres on large swaths of agricultural land Sudan says are within its borders in the al-Fashaqa area, according to an agreement that demarcated the borders between the two nations in the early 1900s.\n\nThe two nations have held rounds of talks, most recently in Khartoum in December, to settle the dispute, but have not made progress.\n\nThe dispute has escalated in recent months after Sudan deployed troops to al-Fashaqa. Sudan said it reclaimed most of its territory and called on Ethiopia to withdraw troops from at least two points it says are inside Sudan.\n\nEthiopian officials, however, accused Sudan of taking advantage of the Tigray conflict region to enter Ethiopian territory. It has called for Sudanese troops to return to their positions before the Tigray fighting erupted in November.\n\nThe border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way dispute over Ethiopia\u2019s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.\n\nBillene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, said on Thursday that ties with Sudan have been \u201ca little bit tricky\u201d and accused Khartoum of occupying Ethiopian territory \u2013 a reference to al-Fashaqa.\n\nShe said Sudan was not a \u201ccredible party\u201d to facilitate negotiations between Abiy\u2019s government and Tigray leaders.\n\nThe conflict erupted in Tigray in November after a falling out between Abiy and the Tigray governing party that had dominated Ethiopia\u2019s government for nearly 30 years. The growing war has threatened to destabilise the entire Horn of Africa.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ethiopia on Sunday.\n\nIn February, Sudan ordered Ambassador Gamal al-Sheikh home from Ethiopia after it accused Ethiopian troops of crossing into Sudan and warned of \u201cgrave repercussions\u201d on the region\u2019s security and stability. Al-Sheikh returned to Addis Ababa weeks later.\n\nThe Tigray war has killed thousands of people and pushed the area to the brink of famine. More than 60,000 people have also fled Tigray and taken refuge in Sudan.",

          "text": "With exactly 559 days to the 2023 presidential election, the search for a new leader for Africa\u2019s most populous country and largest economy \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 has begun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had early in the year announced Saturday, February 18, as the date for the 2023 general election.\n\nFormer Military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB), had curiously opened up a new angle to the 2023 he debate, when in an interview with ARISE News last week, hinted at the qualities a majority of Nigerians should consider in their choice of the next occupant of Aso Rock, the Presidential Villa.\n\nIBB as Babangida is fondly called, had suggested that individuals in their 60s should be the focus of Nigerians as potential presidential or vice presidential candidates in 2023.\n\nFurther, IBB said such persons should have deep knowledge of the economy, must have contacts across the nation and must have been traversing the geo-political zones, marketing their acceptability and capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay. I have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very vast in the economy and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties,\u201d the Minna-born former military leader said.\n\nWith this submission, the former military president, was believed to have ruled out a former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, from the 2023 presidential run, because they would be in their 70s by the next election.\n\nOwing to the mood of the nation, the expectation is largely that the person should be from the southern part of the country. But that is not a given, especially, when the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) argues otherwise in its search for a suitable presidential material.\n\nHowever, given this situation, political pundits have identified a number of Nigerians, who would be under 70 years by 2023 and have the capability to add value to the society, judging from their contributions in either the public or private sectors.\n\nAny of the identified individuals, experts believe, has the skills and competence to steer the country towards realising its much-talked about potential as well as address the socio-economic challenges that have over the years plagued the country.\n\nHere are some eminent Nigerians who may very well fit the bill of IBB\u2019s description of the person to be next President or Vice President in first name alphabetical order.\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu was born on August 4, 1960 in Kano State. He is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder and Chairman of the BUA Group, a Nigerian conglomerate concentrating on manufacturing, infrastructure and agriculture. He attended Capital University in Columbus, Ohio and returned to Nigeria at the age of 24 to oversee his father\u2019s business.\n\nDue to his business interest, Rabiu has establishments across the country. In June this year, the French President, Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the France-Nigeria Business Council \u2013 a private sector initiative to enhance business relations between the two countries and announced Rabiu as the inaugural president of the council.\n\nBut Rabiu is one of the politically green individuals on the list. With near zero political credentials, it does appear tough for Rabiu to sit in this category, but not impossible.\n\nAbdullahi Sule\n\nBorn in December 1959, Abdullahi Sule, is a Nigerian entrepreneur, businessman and politician, who is the current Governor of Nasarawa State. He was elected governor in 2019.\n\nHe attended Roman Catholic Mission (RMC) Primary School, Gudi Station in 1968; Zang Secondary School in 1974, and later Government Technical College, Bukuru in 1977. He left Nigeria on a scholarship to study at Indiana University, Terre Haute, Indiana, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Technology and a master\u2019s degree in Industrial Technology.\n\nAs a governor and businessman in his early sixties, he appears to fit the bill, especially, coming from a liberal northern region \u2013 North Central \u2013 and having managed Dangote Sugar at some point. But with the clamour for a southern president, it may be a tough call for him. Besides, will gamble his near certain re-election for the uncertain presidency?\n\nAbubakar Bagudu\n\nSenator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu is the eighth Governor of Kebbi State, who assumed office on May 29, 2015. The Governor has a lifelong commitment to public service and the proven leadership skills to make government work for the people of his state. Prior to his election in May 2015, he represented Kebbi Central at the Senate.\n\nUnder his leadership, the state entered into a partnership with the Lagos State government on the establishment of a commodity value chain that will give a quantum leap to food processing, production and distribution. This partnership, which is the first of its kind in the history of the Nigerian agricultural sector, is aimed at bringing about national food sufficiency and food security.\n\nHe had his tertiary education at the Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto State, where he obtained his B.Sc in Economics. He proceeded to the University of Jos, Plateau State, where he had his Master of Science in Economics and thereafter, went to Columbia University,where he obtained his M.A in International Affairs.\n\nHowever, coming from a core northern state \u2013 North West \u2013 it is almost a difficult gamble at a time southern presidency is the issue.\n\nAigboje Aig-Imoukhuede\n\nAigboje Aig-Imoukhuede was born in September 1966. He is a Nigerian banker, investor and philanthropist. He is the former Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc as well as the founder and Chairman of Coronation Capital Limited, its affiliates, Coronation Asset Management Limited and Trium Limited.\n\nHe founded Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG) in 2014, and he is the Co-Chairman of the United Kingdom-Nigeria Capital Market Task Force and a board member of TCX Investment Management Company Netherlands. He hails from Edo State and studied law at the University of Benin, where he graduated with LLB degree in 1986. He holds an MBA awarded jointly by the London School of Economics, New York University, and HEC Paris.\n\nAlthough boasts sound economic background, his politics is however nil. It may be another hard nut to crack, albeit not impossible.\n\nAkinwunmi Adesina\n\nAkinwunmi Adesina was born on February 6, 1960. An economist, who is currently serving his second term as the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), had previously served as Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nUntil his appointment as Minister in 2010, he was Vice President of Policy and Partnerships for the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). He is the first Nigeria to be elected AfDB President and hails from Ogun State in South-west Nigeria.\n\nClearly, Adesina has distinguished himself in the business world with sound economic literature, nothing however shows he is able to manage the political side of governance. He also stands a good chance, coming from the Southwest.\n\nAliko Dangote\n\nAliko Dangote was born on April 10, 1957. He is the President of the Dangote Group,which has wide interest in the manufacturing sector. He is Africa\u2019s richest man with an estimated net worth of $11.1 billion as of May 2021. Dangote hails from Kano State and obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in business studies and administration from Al-Azhar University, Cairo.\n\nMany Nigerians believe that if given the opportunity, he could reflect the successes recorded in his companies, which he established as a small trading firm in 1977, and presently have grown into multi-trillion-naira conglomerate with many of its operations in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and Togo, among others.\n\nThe Dangote Group also dominates the sugar market in Nigeria and is a major supplier to the country\u2019s soft drink companies, breweries, and confectioners. The Dangote Group is on the verge of completing its refinery. But, apart from being from the north, Dangote is believed not to have the temperament for politics, although he has friends across all interests. He is currently building one of the largest refinery and petrol chemical plant in the world in Lagos.\n\nAmina Mohammed\n\nMs. Amina Mohammed was born in 1961 in Kaduna State. She is presently the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group. Prior to her appointment, she served as Minister of Environment in Nigeria, where she steered the country\u2019s efforts on climate action and efforts to protect the natural environment.\n\nMohammed first joined the United Nations in 2012 as Special Adviser to former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with the responsibility for post-2015 development planning. She led the process that resulted in global agreement around the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the creation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nShe began her career working on the design of schools and clinics in Nigeria. She served as an advocate focused on increasing access to education and other social services, before moving into the public sector, where she rose to the position of adviser to four successive Presidents on poverty, public sector reform, and sustainable development.\n\nThere\u2019s no gainsaying that this is coming at a time the call to give women a chance has attracted a global attention. Whilst working at the UN might give her some political leverage, being from the north is a major mark down.\n\nAminu Tambuwal\n\nAminu Tambuwal was born in January 1966m and he is the current Governor of Sokoto State. He served as the 10th Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nigeria. He attended Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, where he studied Law, graduating with an LLB (Hons) degree in 1991. He completed his one-year compulsory legal studies at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos, obtained his BL and was called to the Bar in 1992. Tambuwal is a leader who understands how to manage the country\u2019s diversity and he has friends across the country. As a former Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, he is well position to manage diversity\n\nAtedo Peterside\n\nAtedo Peterside, born in July 1955, is an entrepreneur, investment banker, and economist. He is the founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, Anap Business Jets Limited (Anap Jets), and Anap Foundation. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics from the City University, London.\n\nHe went on to obtain an M.Sc. in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1977. Peterside founded the Investment Banking & Trust Company Limited (IBTC) in February 1989 at 33 and served as the bank\u2019s CEO until 2007.\n\nIn 2007, IBTC Chartered Bank Plc merged with Stanbic Bank Nigeria Limited to form Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, and he was elected Chairman of Stanbic IBTC Bank in October 2007, and he resigned in 2017.\n\nAlthough he has always held strong political views, it doesn\u2019t make him politically inclined, much as he is from the southern part of the country, which seeks to produce the next president.\n\nBabatunde Fashola\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola was born in June 1963 and presently the Minister of Works and Housing. He served two terms as Governor of Lagos State from May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015. In 2015, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the Minister of Power, Works and Housing.\n\nHe studied law at the University of Benin, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, LL.B.(Hon), degree in 1987.\n\nFashola, a Notary Public of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, was the second law graduate from the University of Benin and the first member of the Nigerian Law School graduating class of 1988 to be conferred with the professional rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nWith his stellar performance as governor of Lagos State, which put the state on the world map, Fashola is easily one of the few generally adjudged as fit to run Nigeria, almost effortlessly.\n\nApart from boasting capacity and competence, he is also a southerner from the Southwest to be precise. He is loved and respected by his friends for his discipline and political maturity. He is an exceptionally brilliant mind and aptly fits the bill.\n\nBenedict Oramah\n\nDr. Benedict Okey Oramah has been the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank) since September 2015. Under his leadership, the pan-African institution has been playing a leading role in supporting businesses and countries on the continent.\n\nOramah was the Executive Vice President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking from October 2008. In that position, he supervised the business development departments and units of the Bank, namely, Trade Finance and Branches; Project and Export Development Finance; Syndications and Specialised Finance; and Corporate Finance and Advisory Services.\n\nHe joined Afreximbank as Chief Analyst in 1994 and was promoted to the position of Senior Director, Planning and Business Development in 2007. Prior to joining Afreximbank, he was an Assistant Research Manager at the Nigerian Export Import Bank from 1992.\n\nHe holds M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in agricultural economics, obtained in 1987 and 1991 respectively, from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. He bagged, also, a B.Sc. degree in agricultural economics, from the University of Ibadan in 1983. There\u2019s no doubting the fact that he has sufficient private sector experience, but same cannot be said for politics.\n\nBukola Saraki\n\nDr. Bukola Saraki, a former President of the Senate, was Governor of Kwara State from 2003 to 2011; and was elected to the Senate in 2011. Saraki was born in December 1962, in London. He attended Cheltenham College, a public boarding school in the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1981.\n\nHe then proceeded to London Hospital Medical College of the University of London from 1982 to 1987, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery.\n\nSaraki worked as a medical officer at Rush Green Hospital, Essex and had been a Director of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Bank (Nigeria) Limited. In 2000, President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Saraki as his Special Assistant on Budget.\n\nIn addition, Saraki had since the passing of his father, Dr. Olusola Saraki, taken over the political machine of the man mimicked the strongman of Kwara politics and has continued to manage it.\n\nIt is evident that Saraki has grown not only to understand the nuances of both the private and public sector, but also has a good hand of the game of politics. Indeed, many people believed IBB had Saraki in mind, when he gave his description of those eligible to lead Nigeria in 2023.\n\nNothing, however, affirms Saraki\u2019s capacity to effectively lead Nigeria than his four years as Senate President. Although from the North Central region, Saraki is one presidential hopeful believed to stand astride between the South and the north and suitable for the job, if and when a northern joker is to be thrown up in 2023.\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nChukwuma Soludo was born in July 1960. An economics professor and former Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, he is presently the factional gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance. He is also a member of the British Department for International Development Advisory Group.\n\nSoludo has been a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund, the University of Cambridge, the Brookings Institution, the University of Warwick, and the University of Oxford as well as a visiting professor at Swarthmore College (USA). He has also worked as a consultant for a number of international organisations, including The World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nA southerner from the East and combining both the private and public sector experience, Soludo is currently obsessed with his governorship ambition in Anambra State and may not have considered the presidency as an option. However, he also fits the bill.\n\nGodwin Emefiele\n\nThe current Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele was born in August, 1961. He holds a B.Sc. in Finance (1984) and an MBA in Finance (1986), both from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He is also an alumnus of Executive Education at Stanford University, Harvard University (2004) and Wharton School of Business (2005).\n\nHaving run Nigeria\u2019s leading bank, Zenith Bank Plc., for eight years and the Central Bank for six years, he knows exactly what is wrong with the economy. His Anchor borrowers programme has greatly helped poor farmers all over the country, particularly in the North where is well liked.\n\nHe is also well regarded in the Southwest where he was born and known as Omoluabi. Emefiele speaks Yoruba fluently. And he is Igbo speaking from the South-South. Fitting perfectly to the clamour for an Igbo speaking president. Emefiele would be a good fit for president.\n\nGodwin Obaseki\n\nGodwin Obaseki was born in July 1957 and is currently the Governor of Edo State. Before becoming governor, he had served as the chairman of the Edo State Economic and Strategy Team inaugurated by former Governor Adams Oshiomole in March 2009.\n\nHe holds post graduate degrees in both Finance and International Business and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Stock Brokers. Obaseki served as an executive board member of several private companies including Afrinvest.\n\nAs governor and businessman, he clearly has both the private and public sector experience. Perhaps, he needs to do more in terms of disposition and capacity to manage tendence. But, he is pretty much close to the rudimentary requisite.\n\nHerbert Wigwe\n\nHerbert Wigwe was born in August 1966. He is the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing financial institutions. Wigwe has a degree in accountancy from the University of Nigeria, an MA in Banking and Finance from the University College of North Wales (now Bangor), an MSc in Financial Economics from the University of London, and is an Alumnus of the Harvard Business School Executive Management Programme.\n\nHowever, apart from his relationship with politicians, his political credential is nothing close to the requirement of the office of the president except he learns on the job. His current job also gives him contacts across the divides and interests.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nIbikunle Amosun, a former governor of Ogun State and two-term senator, was born in January 1958. Amosun attended Ogun State Polytechnic, graduating with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in 1983.\n\nHe became an Associate member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1990 and went on to become a fellow of the Institute in 1996. He also became an Associate member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (1998).\n\nToday, in Ogun State, Amosun is the single most important issue in the body polity. With a closeness to President Muhammadu Buhari that is beyond human comprehension and a relationship with others across the bridges of the nation, Amosun is largely considered the president\u2019s number one preference from the Southwest if he were given the privilege.\n\nAside being in a vantage position with the part of the country he hails from, Amosun also boasts both the private and the public sectors experience, leaving him with considerable advantage for the job.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nDr. Kayode Fayemi, born in February 1965, is currently serving as the Governor of Ekiti State. He previously served as governor between 2010 and 2014 and was also the Minister of Solid Minerals Development in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet from 11 November 2015 to 30 May 2018, when he resigned to contest for a second time as governor.\n\nHe obtained degrees in History, Politics and International Relations from the University of Lagos and University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). From 1989 to 1992, he earned a Doctorate in War Studies from King\u2019s College London, specialising in civil-military relations.\n\nPut on a scale, Fayemi is believed to be about the most advantageous from the Southwest, being a Christian with high political leverage. His chairmanship of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) confers an unequalled advantage on him, making him have the ears of his colleagues.\n\nAnd with the ongoing extrapolation of a majority of the northern governors, who are largely Muslims, paring with a Christian southern governor is the only gamble they want to take, more so after they had allegedly resolved to ensure that both the offices of the president and the vice president were occupied by governors \u2013 former or current. Fayemi fits the bill.\n\nKingsley Moghalu\n\nProfessor Kingsley Moghalu is already a 2023 presidential aspirant. A lawyer, author and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, he taught at Tufts University as Professor of Practice in International Business and Public Policy at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy from 2015 to 2017.\n\nHe was the presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) in the February 2019, general election. He is the founder of Sogato Strategies LLC, a global investment advisory firm, and the president of the Institute for Governance and Economic Transformation (IGET), a public policy think tank. He is a potential candidate for the office of the president \u2013 skilled largely in private sector experience. He once took his chances in an election, even though he was barely noticed from the votes tabulation.\n\nLeo Stan Ekeh\n\nLeonard Stanley Ekeh was born in February 1956. He has strong knowledge of the economy, especially, how to use technology in transforming an economy. He is the founder and chairman of Zinox Group and also the chairman of Konga.com, a leading e-Commerce company.\n\nDuring his early years, he wanted to own the biggest transport company in Nigeria. He later went to India for his university education, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Punjab University.\n\nEkeh believes that studying in India was a great turning point in his career, because he found the economy of India to be realistic. He also earned an MSc in Risk Management from the University of Nottingham.\n\nHe too has a strong network of friends across the country and affiliations with some of the global tech companies. But like some of his contemporaries in the business world, his connection to the political class is limited and indeed, defined.\n\nWith many of the factors in his favour, his poor understanding of politics is a minus that counts. But whether or not Nigeria wants him that way is a different kettle of fish for as long as votes count.\n\nNasir El-Rufai\n\nThe Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, was born in February 1960. He was aMinister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; and the director of the Bureau of Public Enterprises. El-Rufai attended Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in quantity surveying with first class honours.\n\nIn 1984, he received a Master of Business Administration from the Ahmadu Bello University. He has since attended several professional and post-graduate programmes, including the Georgetown School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C and programmes on privatisation and leadership.\n\nEl-Rufai, no doubt has always had his eyes on the presidency, even though he too believes a younger person is better off on the nation\u2019s number one seat. Interestingly, he has been an advocate for power to return to the south almost since the beginning of this dispensation. Whether or not he would accept to deputise anyone is another ball game altogether.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala\n\nDr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was born in June 1954. She is an economist and the serving Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. She is the first woman and first African to lead global trade body. A two-term former Minister in Nigeria, she sits on boards of Danone, Standard Chartered Bank, Twitter, Mandela Institute for Development Studies, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, One Campaign, GAVI: Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, Rockefeller Foundation, among several global institutions.\n\nShe is another woman, aside Amina, that many people feel deserve a chance to lead the country from the doldrums. Okon-Iweala has no doubt distinguished herself in service to fatherland and indeed, the world.\n\nHowever, she may suffer a different fate as Amina. While she is from the south and might benefit from the agitation for zoning, the question of whether or not Nigeria is ready for a female president never goes away.\n\nPeter Obi\n\nPeter Obi was born in July 1961. He is a politician and businessman, who was the vice presidential candidate during the 2019 general election. A former governor of Anambra State, Obi obtained his first degree at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, graduating with a B.A (Hons) in philosophy in 1984.\n\nHe attended Lagos business school, where he did his Chief executive programme; Harvard business school, Boston, USA, where he did two programmes; London School of Economics, Columbia southwest school, New York, USA, Institute for management development, Switzerland, where he also got two certificates in Senior Executive Programme and Chief Executive Officers programme. He also attended Kellogg graduate school of Management, USA, Oxford University: Said business school and Cambridge University\u2019s George business school.\n\nA Christian from the Southeast zone of the country, Obi has everything going for him, including the understanding of the issues as well as the capacity to sell them. Whether or not the Southeast could get it, is a question the whole of the South would have to answer as the battle for zoning to the region rages. But, yes, he fits the bill.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nRotimi Amaechi, born in May 1965, is the current Minister of Transportation. He served as Governor of Rivers State from 2007 to 2015 and Speaker of the State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2007 \u2013 back to back.\n\nAmaechi received a Bachelor of Arts degree (Honours) in English Studies and Literature from the University of Port Harcourt in 1987. He is currently studying law at a university in Nigeria.\n\nOf all the ministers in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet, Amaechi is one of the few, who have distinguished themselves in terms of performance, and curiously, has become the face of the administration as its poster child.\n\nBut, again, apart from fitting the bill of the president Nigeria needs, Amaechi is one of the few actors, who have not hidden their desire to be president. Not only is he working to achieve this goal, he is also building bridges to that effect.\n\nWith stellar record of performance as minister and a network of friends across the country, a situation made easy by his position as Buhari\u2019s campaign DG for the two times, Amaechi is also believed to have the capacity to muster the needed war chest to prosecute a presidential electoral battle.\n\nBesides, he is also a Christian of the Catholic denomination, whom many of the Northern Muslim governors might want to deputise for a balanced presidential ticket.\n\nSanusi Lamido Sanusi\n\nSanusi was born in July 1961. He is a former Emir of Kano. He is a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria as well as a former Chief Executive Officer of First Bank. Sanusi is a prominent traditional and religious figure as the leader of the Tijaniyyah Sufi order in Nigeria, the second largest Sufi order after the Qadiriyya Sufi order. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from the Ahmadu Bello University in 1981 and a Master degree in Economics. Sanusi has both private and public sector experience and he has a rich network of friends across the country. He understands the workings of the economy.\n\nSegun Agbaje\n\nSegun Agbaje, born in 1964, is the Chief Executive Officer of Guaranty Trust Holding Company. He is also a Director of PepsiCo and member of the Mastercard Advisory Board, Middle East and Africa. Agbaje attended the University of San Francisco, California, where he earned Bachelor of Accounting and Master of Business Administration degrees.\n\nHe started his career working for Ernst & Young in San Francisco and left in 1991 to join GTBank. He rose through the ranks to become an Executive Director in January 2000, and Deputy Managing Director in August 2002.\n\nAgbaja has always played in the private sector with no profile on the political turf and thus, combining both might be quite difficult, since his only option, which is to learn on the job, might be too costly for the patience of the Nigerian people. A Christian, Agbaje is however within the age range of those being sourced, including coming from a privileged zone \u2013 Southwest.\n\nSeyi Makinde\n\nSeyi Makinde, Governor of Oyo State, was born in December, 1967. A businessman, politician and philanthropist, he is an engineer and until his election, he was the GMD of Makon Group Limited, an indigenous oil and gas company.\n\nHe established his first oil and gas private business called Makon Engineering and Technical Services, (METS) at the age of 29, in 1997, after earning years of work experience with international oil and gas companies. He obtained his first degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. In 2000, he had training in automation.\n\nIn 2002, he studied Fundamentals of Crude Sampling at Jiskoot Auto Control Training Centre, Kent, England. Also, in 2005, he studied Understanding and Solving Complex Business Problems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA.\n\nArmed with both the private and public sector experience, Makinde, ticks practically all the boxes of qualification for the job, to which a competent hand is being sought. But like some of his colleagues on the list, will he be willing to leave his near-certain re-election for the uncertain presidency.\n\nImportantly, being in the opposition PDP might serve as a disadvantage for him in case his party throws the ticket open and not directly zones it to the South and Southwest to be precise.\n\nTimipre Sylva\n\nTimipre Sylva was born in July 1964 and is presently the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. He had a stint as governor of oil-rich Bayelsa State. Sylva graduated from the University of Port Harcourt with distinction in English (Linguistics) in 1986.\n\nAt the time, he was the best graduating student from his department and departmental valedictorian. He was subsequently awarded a Doctor in International Relations (Honoris causa) by the UBIS University in 2011.\n\nSylva was awarded his second Doctorate (Honoris Causa) in Public Administration on the 2nd of December 2020 by AiPA (African Institute of Public Administration, Leading Edge Foundation and LBBS.\n\nOver the years, he has developed a network of friends across the country and as a former governor currently holding a political office, there\u2019s no debating the fact that he understands both the business and politics of governance.\n\nInterestingly, those said to be looking in the way of Sylva were believed to be considering him as an option to neutralise the influence and weight of Amaechi in the Niger Delta. Although Sylva and Amaechi were believed to have closed ranks sometime back, it is not certain they would not resume another round of hostility as 2023 inches close.\n\nThat said, Sylva comes close in the category of potential presidential material.\n\nTony Elumelu\n\nTony Elumelu was born in March, 1963. He is an economist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is also the chairman of Heirs Holdings, the United Bank for Africa, Transcorp and founder of The Tony Elumelu Foundation. Elumelu was named among Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People of 2020.\n\nHe hails from Delta State and has two degrees in economics from Nigerian universities: a bachelor\u2019s degree from Ambrose Alli University and Master of Science degree from the University of Lagos.\n\nA shrewd private sector actor, Elumelu\u2019s political inclination appears not sufficient except he learns on the job too. Although he also carries with him some street smartness, which could provide some leverage, how much of contacts he has is definitely not in doubt. With age, knowledge, experience, money and influence, he may not be a bad choice after all.\n\nUdoma Udo Udoma\n\nUdoma Udo Udoma is a former Minister of Budget and National Planning. He is the founding partner of Udo Udoma & Belo Osagie \u2013 one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest and largest commercial law firms.\n\nHe attended St. Catherine\u2019s College, Oxford, England, where he obtained a B.A. (Law) degree in 1976 and a B.C.L. degree in jurisprudence in 1977. He was called to the Nigerian Bar Association in 1978, after obtaining a B.L. degree at the Nigerian Law School.\n\nEvidently in his sixties and with experience in both the private and the public sectors, Udoma has a lot to offer, especially, with his disciplined disposition. A Christian too, he might have to battle internal party antics to get any close. But, without a doubt, he has distinguished himself as worthy.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nProfessor Yemi Osinbajo was born in March 1957 and is currently the vice president. A professor of law, he had his undergraduate degree at the University of Lagos, where he obtained a Second Class Honours (Upper Division) Degree in Law.\n\nIn 1979, he completed the mandatory one-year professional training at the Nigerian Law School, whereon he was admitted to practice as a Barrister and Solicitor of Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court. In 1980, he attended the London School of Economics, where he obtained a Master of Laws degree.\n\nGiven a different field of play, Osinbajo should have been the most eligible to take over from Buhari in 2023. First, he is a Christian of the Pentecostal denomination. Two, he is from the Southwest. Three, he is in his sixties. Four, he can combine both politics and the economy for a smooth run governance.\n\nAlthough he is believed to have zero political base, which is understandable, it is also arguable that he might have learnt on the job, whilst his understanding of the nation\u2019s economy is by every inch not in doubt.\n\nAbove all, having walked with Buhari for eight years, no one can sell the programmes of the administration better or able to sustain the programmes of the regime, whose CHANGE mantra is predicated on the tripod of economy, corruption and security \u2013 the three major monsters still confronting the nation till date, than Osinbajo.\n\nUnfortunately, Osinbajo is believed to have had it pretty much rough with some of those believed to be controlling other levers of power \u2013 a friction that has created an irredeemable level of mistrust. That, of course, appears his only but major undoing as he continues to stealthily eye the presidency.\n\n\u2014Obinna Chima",

          "title": "Weapons Sale Suspension: US Security Cooperation with Nigeria Not Affected, Says Consul General",
          "text": "Security cooperation between the United States and Nigeria has neither been halted nor frozen by the recent suspension of weapons sale to Nigeria by the US Congress. US Consul General in Nigeria Claire Pierangelo disclosed this on-board the visiting United States Ship (USS) Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) jetty, Apapa, in Lagos.\n\nUSS Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams, an Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) 4 permanently deployed to Africa, is in Lagos for a three-day sea exercise with operatives of the Nigerian Navy and their Ghanaian counterparts.\n\nPierangelo said sales and transfers of weapons to the Nigerian military by the US currently exceeded $559 million, emphasising the commitment of the American government to Nigeria\u2019s defence needs.\n\nShe declared, \u201cLet me address first the questions of the role of the US Congress in terms of selling weapons. All foreign military sales, regardless of which country, need congressional notification threshold, must have completed the statutory congressional review process prior to the sale being completed and any equipment under that sale being delivered.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a very robust process in the United States congressional notification. No military sale can go forward without that being done and no military sale will ever be delivered or scheduled whilst subject to any kind of congressional hold or any statutory restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe US is committed to supporting Nigeria\u2019s defence requirements while also ensuring that respect for democracy and human rights remain a key priority in the bilateral relationship.\n\n\u201cWe take seriously our obligations to ensure that all arms sales and transfers are consistent with the law and with the President\u2019s commitment that US arms sales and transfers be consistent with our values, including promoting respect for human right in compliance with the laws of arms conflict.\n\n\u201cSo current security cooperation continues with Nigeria. It has not been halted or frozen. The current value of sales and transfers of capabilities to the Nigerian military exceed some $559 million.\n\n\u201cWe know the arrival of the first 12 A29 Super Tucano is part of that sale, we are working closely with the Nigerian Air Force to make the first six A29 operational and delivering the next six in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we will be working with the Nigerian military to develop additional capabilities to reduce the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties as our partnership here includes an advisor in the law of arms.\u201d\n\nAsked if there were plans by the US to transfer naval assets to the Nigerian Navy under the Excess Defence Article programme, Pierangelo said talks were on. She added that the Nigerian Navy had indicated interest in a number of equipment, explaining that they are eligible to request.\n\nThe consul general stated, \u201cThe Nigerian Navy has expressed great interest in receiving ships from the Excess Defence Article programme. They are, of course, eligible. Our partnership remains strong with Nigerian Navy. We are here to train and work with the Nigerian Navy. It is important we engage with Nigerian agencies.\u201d\n\nOn the visit of the ship, Pierangelo said it was part of the US-Nigeria bilateral relationship, which she described as one of the most important in Africa.\n\nThe ESB ship class is a highly flexible platform that may be used across a broad range of military operations. Acting as a mobile sea base, they are part of the critical access infrastructure that supports the deployment of forces and supplies to support missions assigned.\n\nPierangelo said, \u201cWe work closely with the Nigerian Navy, and with all of Nigeria\u2019s military services, to counter threats to Nigerian and African security.\n\n\u201cAll have a common interest in a peaceful, well-policed Gulf of Guinea, and support from the United States and its like-minded partners significantly increases Nigeria\u2019s ability to reach this shared goal.\n\n\u201cIllicit maritime activities, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; the trafficking of weapons, narcotics, and people; as well as the on-going threat of piracy and oil infrastructure insecurity, undermine the rule of law, food security, and economic development in Nigeria and the greater Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\u201cShip visits, like this one, clearly demonstrate the United States\u2019 continued dedication to our partners in the Gulf of Guinea as they strive for security of their resources, their economy, and their people. We are delighted that Nigeria is hosting this engagement, as we firmly believe that maritime security in Nigeria will lead to greater regional prosperity.\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi",

          "title": "Nigeria Begins Implementation of Central Bank\u2019s $600m Gas Expansion Fund",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has commenced the implementation of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) N250 billion intervention fund for the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP), which is expected to create about three million direct and indirect jobs.\n\nHowever, findings by THISDAY has revealed that the federal government\u2019s plan to enthrone an alternative energy regime in the country through its autogas policy may be heading for failure owing to apathy now observed among the petroleum products marketers towards the initiative.\n\nThe intervention facility for the NGEP, which is targeted at stimulating finance to the critical sector and motivate investment in the gas value chain being funded by the apex bank, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Mr. Bitrus Nabasu, disclosed at the weekend that the process of receiving applications from potential beneficiaries to access the facility had commenced.\n\nHe stated that the fund was available to finance the establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants, gas cylinder manufacturing plants, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) regasification modular systems, automatic conversion kits or components manufacturing plants, CNG primary and secondary compression stations, as well as micro distribution outlets and service centres of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales.\n\nNabasu, noted that the intervention fund was designed to meet certain objectives, including improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain and stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise domestic gas resources for It also set out to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nAccording to Nabasu, the fund would equally provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market, boost employment across the countrh and fast-track the development of gas-based industries, particularly petrochemical (fertiliser and methanol, among others).\n\nThis is with a view to supporting large industries such as agriculture, textile and related industries.\n\nThe fund, he added, would service the development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure, enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets, and any other mid to downstream gas value chain-related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary said: \u201cIt is expected that parties with the capacity to develop and operate any of the afore-listed projects would need to demonstrate project development experience.\n\n\u201cIn addition, interested parties will need to demonstrate technical and commercial capacity.\u201d\n\nNabasu stressed that interested applicants were required to demonstrate evidences of experience and capabilities in their proposed businesses in order to access the fund.\n\nHe urged interested applicants to provide at least general information about them, particularly experiences and evidence of technical competence as well as organisationall structure.\n\nGiving further details, Brenda Ataga, who is the Senior Technical Assistant on Gas Development and Investment to the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said the fund was launched August 2020 by the CBN, adding that since then 27 applications had been recorded on the high capital expenditure portion which has an obligor limit of N10 billion, while 50 applications were received from the small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) side.\n\nThe SMEs support portion, she disclosed, has a limit of N50 million, broken into start-ups and experienced applicants.\n\nShe disclosed that evaluation of applicants would be based on seven fundamental areas.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, our evaluation covers seven fundamental areas which must be evidenced by applicants, and it is very important that this is stated to the applicants because people have sent us all sorts of applications that are not in line with the recommended framework for evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe essence is for us in the ministry to support the propagation of gas and also creation of jobs through access to financing,\u2019\u2019 she said\n\nSMEs, she added, would also follow similar structure, noting that start-ups would enjoy some leniency in the financial model.\n\nStating that SMEs will prove that they are registered in Nigeria, pay their taxes, prove affiliation to first-class companies which are already established businesses with good track records within the gas value chain, she pointed out that there was no deadline for filing of applications.\n\nAccording to her, some preferential treatment would be accorded indigenous companies as well as gender-based considerations for companies in the SMEs\u2019 category.\n\nAtaga noted that one of the positives to be derived from the fund is its potential to support government\u2019s drive to reduce greenhouse gases by a minimum of 50 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government\u2019s plan to enthrone an alternative energy regime in the country through its autogas policy may be heading for failure owing to apathy now observed among the petroleum products marketers towards the initiative.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the absence of sufficient number of cars converted from petrol-powered to either Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-powered in the country and the high cost of gas was dampening marketers\u2019 interest in investing in the building and setting up of autogas filling stations.\n\nIn addition, the seeming failure of the federal government to convert about one million vehicles between December 2020, when the NGEP and the autogas initiative were launched, to December 2021, has further contributed to the marketers\u2019 disinterest to continue with their investment in the programme.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, had promised that the government was going to assist Nigerians to convert their cars free of charge.\n\nBut Sylva\u2019s Technical Adviser on Gas Business and Policy Implementation, Mr. Justice Derefaka, had said the conversion of cars, which he estimated was to cost between N200,000 and N250,000 for one car, was to be borne by each vehicle owner.\n\nHowever, some of the marketers who spoke to THISDAY over the weekend on conditions of anonymity, said they would not take the risk of borrowing huge sums of money to invest in autogas stations when they were not sure of those to patronize them.\n\nThey argued that contrary to what it said, the federal has not been able to convert the one million vehicles they boasted they were going to convert before December 2021, adding that no business man ventures into a business where there is no market for his goods or services.\n\nOne of the marketers who belongs to the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) said though the CBN had given them a repayment term of 10 years for the loan, it was no enough to attract them to go and borrow and invest in autogas facilities.\n\nSylva announced recently in Kano that the government had immediately reduced the domestic base price of natural gas to power plant producers from $2.50 cent to $2.18 cent per standard cubic feet (scf).\n\nHowever, efforts made by THISDAY to get either the Ministry of Petroleum or the NNPC to react to the issues, particularly the extent reached with the cars conversion, proved abortive as neither of them took their phone calls or replied texts sent them.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",

          "title": "Nigeria: With Planned Dividend Payout, NNPC Prepares for Life Outside FG\u2019s Control",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is assiduously working towards the payment of dividends to its shareholders, notably the federal, state and local governments, to satisfy one of the conditions for listing on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), THISDAY learnt on Sunday.\n\nWithin the first six months of the operation of the new petroleum legislation, expected to be signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari any time soon, the Minister of Petroleum Resources, being the president, is mandated under the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to incorporate the NNPC as a limited liability company to be known as NNPC Limited, to fully commercialise its operations.\n\nNigerians were shocked recently to hear the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr. Mele Kyari, declare in public on three separate occasions that the corporation which has consistently operated at a loss plans to pay dividends like the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited.\n\nThe first instance was during an interactive session with the National Association of Energy Correspondents (NAEC) in Abuja, last November; the second was when he appeared on ARISE News Channel to clarify issues around the Dangote Refinery, and the third was last week in Lagos, while delivering an address at an event organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).\n\n\u201cEverything we are doing must align with the wider national interest. And therefore, NNPC, being the representatives of all of us and, is, of course, a very potential global player, this is our ambition and we are getting there.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you, within the next month or two maximum, we will publish our statement of accounts for 2020. And I can also confirm to you that for the first time in our history, we will declare profit to the Nigerian people,\u201d he told his audience.\n\nClause 53 of the legislation recently passed by the National Assembly, says the petroleum minister must consult with the minister of finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which would form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited.\n\nIn addition, 53 (7,8) provides that NNPC Limited must operate as an, \u201cefficient profit-making entity,\u201d declare dividends and also pay all fees, rents, royalties, profit oil share taxes and other requirements on any lease or licence.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt yesterday that to satisfy the standard for listing, which the NNPC would be mandated to do under the new law, Financial Standard \u2018A\u2019 requires that a company which wants to be listed on the main board of the exchange must provide three years financial statements, the most recent of which must not be more than nine months old at the time of application submission.\n\nIn addition, the standard requires that company must provide financial statements with the date of the last audited accounts not being older than nine months.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Mr. Bismarck Rewane, who alluded to the process of listing in a note at the weekend, stressed that the planned action by the national oil company could be a precursor to its listing in 2022.\n\nRewane, noted that listing of the NNPC like it\u2019s Saudi Arabia counterpart, Aramco, could boost market capitalisation by as much as 65 per cent to hit N33 trillion when the deal is completed.\n\n\u201cOnly a discerning analyst would have raised his eyebrow when the NNPC announced its intention to pay its first dividend in September 2021. He would ask if this was a precursor for listing the oil behemoth on the Nigerian stock market just like Aramco did in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cAramco IPO has been the world\u2019s largest to date. To list any company on the exchange, the company must have paid dividends in the prior three years. This announcement was swiftly followed by the FEC approval of NNPC\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical project.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are not only huge but are potentially transformational for the petroleum sector in Nigeria, which had been hitherto in a moribund state.\n\n\u201cThe governance requirements of listed companies is likely to force the NNPC to become more transparent and accountable in its financial management,\u201d Rewane said.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC in its April 2021 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), released yesterday, stated that its expenditure for the month under review increased by 17.24 per cent or N72.34 billion to N492.05 billion.\n\nThe national oil company also announced a trading surplus of N43.57 billion in April 2021, representing a 23.64 per cent increase over the N35.24 billion surplus it recorded in the previous month of March 2021. It also clarified that its calculation of trading surplus or trading deficit was derived after deduction of the expenditure profile from the revenue for the period under review.\n\nAccording to the report, the NNPC\u2019s operating revenue in April 2021, as compared to March 2021, increased by 17.73 per cent or N80.67 billion to stand at N535.61 billion. The NNPC attributed the rise in trading surplus to the activities of the corporation\u2019s upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), such as crude oil lifting from OML 119 (Okono Okpoho) and OMLs 60, 61, 62, 63 (Nigerian Agip Oil Company), as well as increase in gas sales.\n\n\u201cThe positive outlook was further consolidated by the robust gains of two other subsidiaries namely: Duke Oil and the National Engineering and Technical Company (NETCO),\u201d it stated.\n\nIn the downstream, to ensure uninterrupted supply and effective distribution of fuel across the country, it stated that a total of 1.67 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or petrol translating to 55.79 million litres/day were supplied in the month under review.\n\nThe report also showed a 34.29 per cent reduction in the number of pipelines vandalised from 70 in March 2021, to 46 in April 2021. While Port Harcourt area accounted for 54 per cent, Mosimi area accounted for 46 per cent of the vandalised points.\n\nIn the gas sector, a total of 209.27 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas was produced in the month under review, translating to an average daily production of 6,975.72million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd).\n\nFor the period of April 2020 to April 2021, NNPC noted that a total of 2,902.52bcf of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,369.76mmscfd during the period.\n\n\u201cPeriod-to-date production from Joint Ventures (JVs), Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and NPDC contributed about 62.07 per cent, 19.95 per cent and 17.98 per cent respectively to the total national gas production.\n\n\u201cIn terms of natural gas off-take, commercialisation and utilisation, out of the 206.40bcf supplied in April 2021, a total of 126.83bcf of gas was commercialised consisting of 42.92bcf and 83.91bcf for the domestic and export markets respectively.\n\n\u201cThis translates to a total supply of 1,430.90mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 2,976.94mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month.\n\n\u201cThis implies that 61.45 per cent of the average daily gas produced was commercialised while the balance of 38.55 per cent was either re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared. Gas flare rate was 9.74 per cent for the month under review (i.e. 670.19mmscfd) compared with average gas flare rate of 7.42 per cent (i.e. 542.22mmscfd) for the period of April 2020 to April 2021,\u201d it noted.\n\nAccording to the national oil company, a total of 795mmscfd was delivered to gas-fired power plants in the month of April 2021 to generate an average power of about 3,416 MW.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",
